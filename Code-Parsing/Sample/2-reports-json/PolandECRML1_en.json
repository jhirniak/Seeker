According to estimates by representatives of the German minority, there are up to 600 000\nGermans. The German minority is compactly settled in Upper Silesia (Opole and Silesia voivodships)\nand to some extent in the Warmia-Masuria voivodship while also being dispersed in the Lower Silesia,\nLubuskie, Western Pomerania and Pomerania voivodships. Most Germans belong to, or are\ndescendants of what was formerly the German majority population of these territories from where 8.5\nmillion Germans were expelled after 1945. In addition, smaller groups of Germans have traditionally\nlived in other areas. The present situation of the German language is affected by the discrimination of\nthe German minority between 1945 and 1989 (prohibition to use and teach German, systematic\nremoval of traces of the language from the public and official denial of the existence of a German\nminority).\n", "577.": " The Committee of Experts considers that the offer of the teaching of Russian is appropriate for\nthe purpose of the present undertaking.

As mentioned in paragraph 411 above,\nthere are two further municipalities where the Lithuanian minority makes up 19% and 8% of the\npopulation. In neither of them have the local councils decided so far to hold consultations on the\nintroduction of additional place-names. The threshold consequently deprives Lithuanian of protection in\nmunicipalities where the Lithuanian speakers are traditionally present and where they constitute a\nrelevant number for the purpose of the present undertaking. Considering the formal and practical\nproblems created by the threshold, the Committee of Experts concludes that Article 10.2g applies also\nto those local and regional authorities where the regional or minority language speakers do not attain\nthe 20%-threshold but represent nevertheless a sufficient number of speakers for the purpose of this\nundertaking.

The\nnumber of people covered by the broadcasting range currently amounts to 800,000.\n46\n\nSee 1st Report of the Committee of Experts in respect of the United Kingdom, ECRML (2004) 1, paragraph 263; 2nd Report of\nthe Committee of Experts in respect of the Slovak Republic, ECRML (2009) 6, paragraph 504; 2nd Report of the Committee of\nExperts in respect of Switzerland, ECRML (2004) 6, paragraph 118\n\n46\n\n\f265.\n\nThe Committee of Experts considers this undertaking fulfilled\nc\n\n...\nii\n\nto encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in the regional or minority\nlanguages on a regular basis;\n\n", "528.": " The initial periodical report states that, pursuant to the Act on National and Ethnic Minorities\nand on the Regional Language (Article 18 and Article 20.2), the public authorities are obliged to take\nappropriate measures aimed to protect, preserve and develop the cultural identity of the national\nminorities.\n", "272.": " The Committee of Experts considers this undertaking not fulfilled. It encourages the Polish\nauthorities to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual productions in\nKashub.\ng\n\nto support the training of journalists and other staff for media using regional or minority languages.\n\n", "409.": " The Committee of Experts is not in a position to conclude on the fulfilment of this undertaking.\nIt asks the Polish authorities to submit specific information in the next periodical report.\n\nArticle 9 \u2013 Judicial authorities\nParagraph 2\nThe Parties undertake:\na\n\nnot to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State solely because they are drafted in a\nregional or minority language; or\n\n", "516.": " According to the initial periodical report, state support (targeted grants or specified-user\ngrants) for audio works is possible pursuant to the Act on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the\nRegional Language. However, there are no indications that the Polish authorities have encouraged\nand/or facilitated the production and distribution of audio and audiovisual works in Ukrainian.\n", "485.": " The New National Core Curriculum (the Regulation of the Ministry of National Education of 23\nDecember 2008) provides for the teaching about minorities in Poland (including their culture, history\nand traditions) for all pupils and makes it explicit only for the levels of secondary education (lower and\nhigher secondary schools). However, as the implementation of the curriculum only started in 2009, it is\ntoo early to be able to evaluate its effectiveness.\n", "458.": " Article 32.2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland states that \u201cnobody can be\ndiscriminated in public, social or economic life for any reason.\u201d However, there is no information about\n74\n\nSee for example 3rd Report of the Committee of Experts in respect of Hungary, ECRML 2007 (5), paragraph 202\nSee for example 2nd Report of the Committee of Experts in respect of Spain, ECRML (2008) 5, paragraph 521; 1st Report of\nthe Committee of Experts in respect of Croatia, ECRML (2001) 2, paragraph 105\n\n75\n\n74\n\n\f76\n\nhow the Polish authorities oppose with specific measures any discouragement of the use of the\nregional or minority languages in connection with economic or social activities.\n", "136.": " However, in practice, there is no primary education where German is used as a language of\neducation. German is usually taught only as a subject (three hours per week), using a methodology for\nteaching German as a foreign language. One bilingual (Polish/German) primary school has been\nestablished in the Silesia voivodship with additional support from Germany. The Committee of Experts\nunderlines that the present undertaking requires that primary education in the regional or minority\nlanguage is made available. This implies the provision of education essentially with the regional or\nminority language as the language of education. Teaching German only as a subject or organising a\nsubstantial part of primary education in the regional or minority language, as seems to be the case in\none bilingual primary school, is not sufficient because these educational models are covered by the\nundertakings under Articles ", "319.": " The initial periodical report states that, on the basis of the provisions of the Regulation of the\nMinister of National Education of 19 November 2009 concerning teacher training units, there is a\npossibility of appointing language methodology advisers within the teaching of regional or minority\nlanguages. In accordance with the Act on the System of Education, voivodship in-service teacher\ntraining units are in charge of organising and conducting methodological consultancy according to the\nneeds. In 2009, the methodological care over schools for minorities was exercised by five teaching\nconsultants and twelve methodological advisers for all regional or minority languages. However, the\nCommittee of Experts notes that such methodological consultancy does not ensure the basic and\nfurther training of the teachers required to teach in regional or minority languages at various levels of\neducation.\n", "633.": " The Committee of Experts considers this undertaking not fulfilled. It encourages the Polish\nauthorities to prohibit the insertion in internal regulations of companies and private documents of any\nclauses excluding or restricting the use of Armenian, Czech, Karaim, Romani, Russian, Slovak, Tatar\nand Yiddish, at least between users of the same language.\nc\n\nto oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or minority languages in connection with\neconomic or social activities;\n\n", "200.": " Due to the lack of specific information, the Committee of Experts is not in a position to\nconclude on this undertaking. It asks the Polish authorities to provide further information in the next\nperiodical report.\ng\n\nto encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies responsible for collecting, keeping a copy\nof and presenting or publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;\n\n", "563.": " In light of the obligation entered into by Poland, the Committee of Experts considers this\nundertaking not fulfilled for Armenian, Czech, Karaim, Romani, Russian, Slovak, Tatar and Yiddish.

However, this undertaking deals with public enterprises such as the railway, urban\ntransport, electricity, water and gas, cleaning and sanitation, telephone services, refuse collection and\ndisposal, sporting facilities or entertainment venues. From the information available it appears that no\nactivities have been organised to promote the use of the regional or minority languages in this field.\n", "606.": " As regards Romani, according to the initial periodical report, the Polish authorities provide\nfinancial assistance inter alia to the monthly publication \u201cDialog \u2013 Pheniben\u201d (which is 10% in Romani),\nbut also to the
