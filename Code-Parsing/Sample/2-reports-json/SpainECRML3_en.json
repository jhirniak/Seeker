It is for\nexample possible for existing supervisory bodies to carry out these functions and be integrated into\nexisting administrative structures.

It seems that this is due to the high number of\nnon-speakers arriving in the Balearic Islands. In their view, teachers need more support in this respect,\nincluding teaching material. Each school council decides on the share of Catalan subjects. In Palma\nthere are no entirely Catalan-medium schools.

The\nCommittee of Experts reminds the authorities that this undertaking requires constant efforts to maintain the\nprovision of services at a satisfactory level due to its importance to the speakers, and encourages the\nauthorities to comment on this in the next periodical report.\n\"d\n\nto ensure by appropriate means that safety instructions are also drawn up in regional or minority languages;\"\n\n", "633.": " The Committee of Experts concludes that Article ", "951.": " Concerning primary and secondary education, Decree 124/2007 of 28 June was replaced by\nDecree 79/2010 of 20 May on multilingualism in non-university education in Galicia which regulates that\n\u2013 theoretically - subjects should be taught through the medium of one third each in Galician, English and\nCastilian. This school model will be compulsory for all schools in Galicia. As non-governmental sources\npointed out, the new Decrees establish a ceiling for Galician-medium education at 33%, whereas\nprevious decrees ruled a minimum percentage of hours. They have also shown their dissatisfaction with\nthe fact that the new Decree establishes that at primary and lower secondary school level, science\nsubjects are to be taught through the medium of Castilian, and the subjects dealing with the knowledge\nof the natural, social and cultural systems in Galician. The Committee of Experts invites the authorities to\ntake measures so that the introduction of the compulsory trilingual model does not disproportionately\naffect Galician-medium education.\n", "200.": " According to the information provided by the Asturian authorities, since 2004-2005 there has\nbeen an offer of Asturian Galician; nowadays, more than 40% of primary schools offer Asturian\nGalician and more than 20% of pupils attend these classes. More than 80% of secondary schools offer\nit, and classes are attended by more than 13% of pupils.\n", "848.": " The publication of documents in Valencian seems to be largely available in local authorities in\nthe predominantly Valencian-speaking areas and in the Valencian Government.

As for the accessibility of webpages of\nthe ministries or state administration bodies, static information and first level navigation is usually\navailable in Galician, and is possible up to third level of navigation on a number of websites.\n", "563.": " According to the information provided in the third periodical report, it seems that on average\napproximately one third of the forms are generally available to citizens in State administrative offices\nlocated in the Autonomous Community. As mentioned in paragraph 289 above, according to\nrepresentatives of the speakers many documents are only available in Castilian. According to them,\nthe most frequently used documents have not been made available in Basque.\n", "899.": "\n\nThe Committee of Experts considers the undertaking remains nevertheless fulfilled.\n\nParagraph 3\nThe Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of the users of regional or minority languages are represented or taken\ninto account within such bodies as may be established in accordance with the law with responsibility for guaranteeing the\nfreedom and pluralism of the media.\n\n", "342.": " While acknowledging the substantial efforts it takes to offer technical and vocational education\nin Basque, due to the relatively low number of pupils and the diversity of subjects, the Committee of\nExperts nevertheless reminds the authorities of their obligation under this undertaking and encourages\nthem to gradually increase the offer of Basque-medium education in technical and vocational\neducation.\n", "439.": " The Committee of Experts understands that if the Government of Navarre refuses to cover the\ncosts incurred for the reception of EITB in DTT, it will no longer be available once analogue\nbroadcasting disappears. If regional television in Navarre is inadequate or non-existent, the Navarrese\nauthorities are nevertheless obliged to ensure the creation of a new Basque language television\nchannel. In this sense, the authorities of Navarre should regard the retransmission of EITB as being\nnot only the sole interest of the Basque authorities but also as their own obligation, which implies\ncovering the retransmission costs.\n", "180.": " In the second monitoring round (paragraph 152 of the second evaluation report), the Committee\nof Experts had been informed of an agreement between the two Autonomous Communities in favour of\nthe Basque language, and encouraged the authorities to provide more information on the content of this\nagreement and how it operates in practice.\n", "378.": " As for recruitment and training of civil servants in Navarre, general legislation considers Basque\nlanguage knowledge as one of the merits used for hiring and assigning staff. It is rated at 6% with\nrespect to the total points assigned to all merits for all positions in the \u201cBasque-speaking zone\u201d,\nwhenever knowledge of the said language is not a job requirement. In the \u201cMixed zone\u201d, where 80% of\nthe positions are located, the minimum rating is 3%. For those positions requiring more public\nattendance, such as administrative and auxiliary positions, the percentage rises to 10% and 5%\nrespectively.
