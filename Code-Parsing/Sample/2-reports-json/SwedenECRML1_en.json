Beginning with a handful of schools in 1991, the numbers are increasing rapidly and\nindependent schools are today competing with public schools in many municipalities, especially in the big\ncities. Today, 5% of all schools in Sweden are independent schools. The independent schools offer specific\nprofiles and some of them have adopted ethnic/linguistic profiles. Part of them are run by teachers, parents\nor interested private persons. The establishment of language-oriented independent schools has been\ntriggered by the extensive withdrawal of the previous bilingual or \u201chome language\u201d classes in municipal\nschools.

There will also be a regional conference for the local and regional\nauthorities in Norrbotten in the autumn 2003.\nEducation\nAs from the 1 March 2003 the National Agency for Education has been divided into two authorities, one for\ninspection and supervision (the National Agency for Education) and one for development (the Authority for\nSchool Development). One of the main tasks for the new Authority for School Development the coming years\nwill be improving the conditions for education in segregated areas. Strengthening the mother tongue\ninstruction, for example by bilingual classes, will be one part of the work.\nThe National Agency for Education in its report on mother tongue instruction, delivered in May 2002,\nundertakes to spread information about the value of mother tongue instruction from an individual perspective\nand from a society perspective. In different teaching materials the agency will highlight the importance of\nmother tongue in order to enhance the quality of education.\nSpecific comments\n", "117.": "\nOn the other hand, the municipalities are sometimes not informed or instructed about their\nobligations stemming from the language legislation. Even though the authorities have allowed the use of\nSami in administration and made funds available, the efforts seem to have little or no effect. The authorities\nshould strengthen their efforts with the aim of ensuring the possibility of users of Sami to be able to use the\nlanguage in relation to local and regional authorities.\nThe Committee encourages the state authorities to raise awareness among the relevant local and\nregional authorities of their obligation to produce official documents in Sami, make it possible for\nusers of Sami to submit documents, and thereby contribute to the fulfilment of this undertaking.\n\n\u201cg.\n\nthe use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the official\nlanguage(s), of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority\nlanguages.\u201d\n\n", "77.": "\nThe conclusion of the Committee of Experts is that these undertakings are, on the whole, considered\nfulfilled.\n\n16\n\n\fSecondary Education\n\u201cc.i.\nc.ii.\nc.iii.\nc. iv.\n\nto make available secondary education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or\nto make available a substantial part of secondary education in the relevant regional or minority\nlanguages; or\nto provide, within secondary education, for the teaching of the relevant regional or minority\nlanguages as an integral part of the curriculum; or\nto apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above at least to those pupils\nwho, or where appropriate whose families, so wish in a number considered sufficient\u201d\n\n", "89.": "\nThe national school curriculum has been amended to include the teaching of the history and culture of\nthe Sami. The same applies to the school syllabi. The National Board on Education is presently developing\nmaterial to use for history teaching, including the history and culture of the minority languages. According to\nthe information received by the Committee, a deeper involvement on the part of the Sami Parliament in\nproviding teachers with teaching materials on the Sami history, language and culture would be welcome.\n", "20.": "\nThe instrument of ratification submitted by Sweden to the Council of Europe provides an extensive\nand detailed presentation of the protection granted to the Sami, Finnish and Me\u00e4nkieli languages. For these\nlanguages protected under Part III, separate paragraphs and sub-paragraphs were identified as being\napplicable.\n", "68.": "\nAccording to the Sami School Ordinance and in agreement with local authorities, the Sami School\nBoard can fulfil municipal obligations for pre-school and recreational activities for Sami children. In order to\ndo this the Sami School Board is always obliged to make a specific agreement with the relevant municipality\nbut the latter is required to finance the schools. The decision to organise this education depends\npredominantly on the political will of the respective local authority. The Sami pre-schools are required to\nfollow the state policy for pre-schools, but they have the right to focus on the protection and strengthening of\nthe Sami culture, language and traditions. The use of the Sami language has increased over the last few\nyears in the Sami pre-schools. Sami pre-school education is presently found in Kiruna, G\u00e4llivare and\nJokkmokk. According to the report published in 2001 by the National Agency for Education, the total number\nof children in the Sami pre-schools in 2000/2001 was 51.\n", "176.": "\n\nThe Committee considers the undertaking fulfilled.\n\n", "80.": "\nThe Committee considers the undertaking formally fulfilled but improvements could be made for the\navailability of secondary education.\nThe Committee encourages the Swedish authorities to promote and enhance the teaching of\nSami at secondary school level, by encouraging the municipalities to implement the undertaking\nand developing teaching materials.\n\nTechnical and vocational education\n\n\u201cd.i.\nd. ii.\nd.iii.\nd. iv.\n\nto make available technical and vocational education in the relevant regional or minority\nlanguages; or\nto make available a substantial part of technical and vocational education in the relevant regional\nor minority languages; or\nto provide, within technical and vocational education, for the teaching of the relevant regional or\nminority languages as an integral part of the curriculum; or\nto apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above at least to those pupils who,\nor where appropriate whose families, so wish in a number considered sufficient\u201d\n\n", "136.": "\nThe Swedish authorities in their initial periodical report state that the terms and conditions governing\npublic subsidies for the press include special rules on the allocation of funds to newspapers that address\nminorities in their own languages. The supplementary information received by the Committee however states\nthat the relevant legislation requires a newspaper\u2019s contents to be mainly in Swedish to qualify for a subsidy.\n", "35.": "\nThe Committee of Experts considers that the Swedish authorities are developing a positive practice to\npromote and enhance the situation of the regional or minority languages in Sweden. Over the past years, the\nauthorities have tried to establish a legal structure guaranteeing a certain use of Finnish, Me\u00e4nkieli and the\nSami languages in courts and before administrative authorities. These laws, however, are not being applied to\ntheir fullest extent, partly because the likely users of the language, whether they be from the central, regional or\nlocal authorities, or from the general public, lack information. It can nevertheless be stated that for these three\nlanguages the state is initiating a policy for resolute action to be taken.\nThe Committee encourages the continuation of this work and looks forward to seeing the results\nreflected in Sweden\u2019s next periodic report.\n", "47.": "\nIn addition to teaching of the mother-tongue, minority languages are sometimes used as media of\ninstruction. According to the School Ordinance, the percentage of instruction through the medium of minority\n11\n\n\flanguages may not exceed 50% and should diminish when pupils advance to higher classes. In 2001, the\nNational Agency for Education published a report on the situation of national minority languages in the Swedish\nschool system, and according to the information in this report, mother-tongue medium instruction is carried out\nwithin the Sami schools, the Sweden Finnish independent schools and the few still existing bilingual classes.\nSome theme-based instruction in Me\u00e4nkieli is also taking place in the Me\u00e4nkieli profile independent school in\nPajala municipality. Remedial mother-tongue medium education for pupils in need of extra support in specific\nsubjects is according to the report especially important for Roma pupils.\n", "168.": "\nIt is also pointed out in this connection that one of the goals of the National Council for Cultural Affairs\nis to promote cultural diversity and the exchange of cultural impulses between various groups in society.\n", "94.": "\nThe Ministry of Education has recently given more attention and funding to the training of teaching in\nimmigrant and minority languages. About 4 000 teachers will have the opportunity to receive this training in\nthe near future.\n", "160.": "\nAlthough there is no Sami representative in the National Council for Cultural Affairs, the Sami\nParliament is primarily responsible for the distribution of the State grant for cultural activities they receive.
