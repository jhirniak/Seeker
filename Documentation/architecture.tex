\section{Motivation}
\paragraph{}
The researches in minority languages need to extract comparative information from sources varying in format and the content. These sources of information are usually very rich, but lack common structure. Most often useful data is spread among documents in PDF. Usually the sources describe many languages (more than 50 for European Committee website) and have different organization and approach to presenting information. Therefore, extracting information from such source is very elaborative and repetitive, being exactly what computers are the best in.

\paragraph{}
The goal of the project is to provide easy access to all the documents using convinient query language.

\section{Stakeholders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Researchers - people who are using service often for their research;
  \item Consumers - people who need to access data occassionally and do not have need to register an account in the service;
  \item Administrators - people having rights to add sources, respond to tickets, etc.;
  \item Developer - person responsible for the project development and maintenance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Name}
The project name \emph{Seeker} comes from \href{http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/seeker-reaper}{``Seeker, Reaper''} poem by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Campbell_Hay}{George Campbell Hay}. You can listen to the peom being recited on YouTube \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxPtRZFF24}{here}.

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Minimal requirement}
The goal for 8 week summer project was set to
\begin{itemize}
  \item carry out research and recommend appropriate solution (architecture, full software stack, and persistence layer);
  \item Implement a proof of concept functionality to prove the possibility of developing efficient solution for the stated problem, this is, ability to query European Committee for Minority Languages and receive combined documents composed of elements specified in the query.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data format}
The main source of the data are going to be the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages expert reports\footnote{\url{http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/default_en.asp}}.

The goal of the project is to account for the future grow and to include also documents from Galeic Plans produced by various bodies in Scotland \footnote{http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/our-work/gaelic-language-plans.php}.

The data needs to be assumed to do not have any common format or fields.

\section{Use cases}
During the initial meeting on 26 May 2014 the below use cases had been identified.

\chapter{Requirements analysis}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contiunable - the project development should be easy to continue
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Well-documented
      \item Popular and well-documented technologies should be used
      \item Well-organized code base
    \end{itemize}
  \item Schemaless - documents (sometimes even from the same source) will have different structure, so it is important to not restrict the database to store one kind (structure) of information
  \item Adaptability - it shoud be easy to adapt a project to a new kind of documents/task
  \item Modularity - the distinguishable project parts should be implemented in modular fashion to increase clarity and make the future development easier
  \item Open source - all technologies and tools used should be open source
\end{itemize}

\section{Data layer}
\subsection{Example query}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show all Committee of Experts recommendations under article 7b.
  \item Show all sections relating to Scottish Gaelic.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Options}
The following database technologies were taken into consideration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Traditional RDMS such as PostreSQL and MySQL
  \item Key-value store such as Riak and Redis
  \item Document database such as MongoDB and CouchDB
  \item Graph database such as Neo4J and Infinite Graph
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Traditional RDMS} has drawback of dedicated to the outlined schema and every new document (not to mention every new source of documents) has a chance to have different organization than the previous ones.

\paragraph{Key-value store} has not enough good query languages and 

\paragraph{Document database} has both flexible structure of aggregates (so we are not dedicated to one schema) and powerful query language (which can be implemented using incremental update)

\paragraph{Graph database} has ability to perform rich queries regarding relationships, but is not as powerful when it comes to queries relating the content, can answer queries like 1 and 2 in O(1) time, but update is expensive.

\subsection{Choice}
MongoDB has been chosen for storing documents because
\begin{itemize}
  \item it has big community of supporters and developers;
  \item it is well-documented;
  \item naturally blends with JavaScript when implementing query (JQuery notation) and data from the database (JSON);
  \item can store and operate on big documents of varying schema easily
  \item has rich query language with greater capabilities than the need outlined in the example queries subsection;
  \item when used with Node.js increases programmers productivity significantly (one language, centralized view)
\end{itemize}

When developing session and account management functionality it would be beneficial to implement the concept of polyglot persistence and for these two use key-value database, which creates separation of the concers as well as suits better the case.


\section{Application layer}
\subsection{Example usage}

\subsection{Options}
Three programming languages/frameworks were considered as potentially suitable for the project, namely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Java and JSP
  \item Python and Django
  \item JavaScript and Node.js
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Java and JSP} does not support well the programmer productivity as to perform even the simplies operations it is very expressive. When used the application needs to be developed and tested as a whole, so it does not support modularity and extendability well. The data layer technology of choice provides API for the language, but it is rather easier and more natural to operate on it in JavaScript than in Java.

\paragraph{Python and Django} had the same drawbacks, except it provides greater productivity.

\paragraph{JavaScript and Node.js} means that one language would be used for front-end and back-end, including data quering and manipulation, what highly increases the programmer productivity. Further, JavaScript as front-end language provides rich choice of libraries like jQuery, Angular, etc. that can be used to further increase productivity and presentation quality. When it comes to the back-end all operations are handled efficiently using event-loop. The aggregates are retrieved in JSON format and MongoDB can be naturally quiered using jQuery like notation. This all results in complete and efficient solutioon.

\subsection{Choice}

Node.js has been chosen for the front-end and back-end development because
\begin{itemize}
  \item it integrates well with MongoDB
  \item enables using one language for everything (front-end, back-end, database);
  \item is efficient 
\end{itemize}

\section{Query language}

\subsection{Elements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{source documents} (e.g. Committee of Experts reports)
  \item \emph{document specifiers} (e.g. cycle, country producing the document)
  \item \emph{selectors} (i.e., languages, sections, words)
  \item \emph{organizer} specifying how to structure the output document (e.g. arrange by section numbers, in each section by countries alphabetically)
  \item \emph{template} choose how to style the output document
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies as tree}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Source documents} must be root.
  \item \emph{Document specifiers} can be children of each another, but can occur only once on any path from root to leaves, can appear multiple times.
  \item \emph{Selectors} (i.e. languages, sections, words) can be children of any node, and they are always terminal (leaves).
  \item \emph{Organizers}, \emph{templates}, and other similar options which can be added in the future must be children of root, and in case of \emph{organizers} they must be aware of all root's children except itself to display available options.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Query evaluation stages}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select relevant documents using:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item producer - group (e.g. committee)
    \item producer - origin, i.e. countries (e.g. UK)
    \item cycles - time (e.g. last)
  \end{itemize}
  \item filter the document content using selectors (i.e. sections, languages, filters- words, phrases, etc.)
  \item reorganize resulting JSON using organizers
  \item render using template
\end{enumerate}
