\section{Motivation}
\paragraph{}
The World Wide Web is a very rich source of information and many excellent search engines exist that help to find interesting information in the matters of milliseconds. However, they only provide links to the source of information and if user wants to compare data from many sources or gather it for analysis purpose they are left with a daunting task of collecting all this information by hand.

\paragraph{}
This is repetitive and boring task, something that humans do not enjoy, but computers excel in. It would be of significant help to any researchers that need to compare vast sections of information from multitude of sources to have a tool that would take care of the first part of the analysis, which is collection of relevant data, and let the researcher to concentrate on what is important and hard - the reasoning about the data.

\paragraph{}
The goal of this project is to research feasibility of implementing a system for querying big data sets (e.g. collection of 100 pages report from standardization committee) and presenting only relevant sections of it (e.g. only few paragraphs of interest filtered from across a thousand of related documents stored in the database).  The last step of the project is to implement a proof of concept system that possibly could be developed into fully functional system.

\section{Feasibility and technologies}
\paragraph{}
The first part of the project is going to be to investigate the nature of the problem and if it can be efficiently solved. If it can be solved then suitable technologies will be suggested and used in the proof of concept system.

\section{Proof of concept}
\paragraph{}
The project idea originated from a problem presented by the researches in minority languages at the University of Edinburgh, who faced issue of gathering data from variety of sources, for instance from \href{http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/default_en.asp}{European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages} website for comparative analysis and producing various reports based on that data. However, the problem is that data is presented in PDF reports (and is not annotated in anyway), the layout of reports vary (depending on the cycle, country issuing it, and other factors), and average length of a report is over 100 pages. Thus, any researcher interested in this data set is likely to spend majority of the time on extracting the data of interest.

\paragraph{}
Therefore, it is natural that the proof of concept is going to be implemented as a solution to a problem of selecting interesting data out of hundreds of reports availble at \href{http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/default_en.asp}{European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages} website.

\section{Data sources}
\paragraph{}
The primary intended source of data are long documents, often being reports, with usual length from 50 to 100 pages, in different formats like DOC(X), ODT, PDF, TXT, etc. and being unannounced beside in the most optimistic case having similar structure across range of documents. For example, for the proof of concept there are 651 PDF documents listed on the page, of which 309 documents are in English (some documents are produced also in French or country producing report official language), of which 300 documents are of actual interest (rest includes charter advertisements or documents that do not present valuable source of information). There are 25 countries producing reports, each adhering to general layout, but with subtle differences coming from the tool used or typesetting conventions, which should be taken into account during parsing PDF into JSON\footnote{Thus, the optimal parser would be context aware (and such parser was implemented for this project).}.

\section{Stakeholders}

Each of the stakeholders is important part of the system without which the system could not be considered successful, all with different needs, and assumptions about the system functionality.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Researchers - people who are using service often for their research and rely on the correctness and up-to-date properties of the system;
  \item Consumers - people who need to access data occasionally and do not have need to register an account in the service, or even do not care if the document published 2 days ago is included in the search;
  \item Administrators - people having rights to add sources, respond to tickets, etc., and responsible for the service maintenance;
  \item Developer - person responsible for the project development and code base maintenance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Name}
The project name \emph{Seeker} comes from \href{http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/seeker-reaper}{``Seeker, Reaper''} poem by \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Campbell_Hay}{George Campbell Hay}. You can listen to the peom being recited on YouTube \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxPtRZFF24}{here}.

%--- Ch2: Requirements

\chapter{Requirements}

\section{Minimal requirement}
The goal for 8 week summer project was set to
\begin{itemize}
  \item carry out research and recommend appropriate solution (architecture, full software stack, and persistence layer);
  \item Implement a proof of concept functionality to prove the possibility of developing efficient solution for the stated problem, this is, ability to query European Committee for Minority Languages and receive combined documents composed of elements specified in the query.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data format}
The main source of the data are going to be the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages expert reports\footnote{\url{http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/default_en.asp}}.

The goal of the project is to account for the future grow and to include also documents from Galeic Plans produced by various bodies in Scotland \footnote{http://www.gaidhlig.org.uk/bord/en/our-work/gaelic-language-plans.php}.

The data needs to be assumed to do not have any common format or fields.

\section{Use cases}
During the initial meeting on 26 May 2014 the below use cases had been identified.

\chapter{Requirements analysis}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Contiunable - the project development should be easy to continue
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Well-documented
      \item Popular and well-documented technologies should be used
      \item Well-organized code base
    \end{itemize}
  \item Schemaless - documents (sometimes even from the same source) will have different structure, so it is important to not restrict the database to store one kind (structure) of information
  \item Adaptability - it shoud be easy to adapt a project to a new kind of documents/task
  \item Modularity - the distinguishable project parts should be implemented in modular fashion to increase clarity and make the future development easier
  \item Open source - all technologies and tools used should be open source
\end{itemize}

\section{Data layer}
\subsection{Example query}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show all Committee of Experts recommendations under article 7b.
  \item Show all sections relating to Scottish Gaelic.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Options}
The following database technologies were taken into consideration:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Traditional RDMS such as PostreSQL and MySQL
  \item Key-value store such as Riak and Redis
  \item Document database such as MongoDB and CouchDB
  \item Graph database such as Neo4J and Infinite Graph
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Traditional RDMS} has drawback of dedicated to the outlined schema and every new document (not to mention every new source of documents) has a chance to have different organization than the previous ones.

\paragraph{Key-value store} has not enough good query languages and 

\paragraph{Document database} has both flexible structure of aggregates (so we are not dedicated to one schema) and powerful query language (which can be implemented using incremental update)

\paragraph{Graph database} has ability to perform rich queries regarding relationships, but is not as powerful when it comes to queries relating the content, can answer queries like 1 and 2 in O(1) time, but update is expensive.

\subsection{Choice}
MongoDB has been chosen for storing documents because
\begin{itemize}
  \item it has big community of supporters and developers;
  \item it is well-documented;
  \item naturally blends with JavaScript when implementing query (JQuery notation) and data from the database (JSON);
  \item can store and operate on big documents of varying schema easily
  \item has rich query language with greater capabilities than the need outlined in the example queries subsection;
  \item when used with Node.js increases programmers productivity significantly (one language, centralized view)
\end{itemize}

When developing session and account management functionality it would be beneficial to implement the concept of polyglot persistence and for these two use key-value database, which creates separation of the concers as well as suits better the case.


\section{Application layer}
\subsection{Example usage}

\subsection{Options}
Three programming languages/frameworks were considered as potentially suitable for the project, namely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Java and JSP
  \item Python and Django
  \item JavaScript and Node.js
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Java and JSP} does not support well the programmer productivity as to perform even the simplies operations it is very expressive. When used the application needs to be developed and tested as a whole, so it does not support modularity and extendability well. The data layer technology of choice provides API for the language, but it is rather easier and more natural to operate on it in JavaScript than in Java.

\paragraph{Python and Django} had the same drawbacks, except it provides greater productivity.

\paragraph{JavaScript and Node.js} means that one language would be used for front-end and back-end, including data quering and manipulation, what highly increases the programmer productivity. Further, JavaScript as front-end language provides rich choice of libraries like jQuery, Angular, etc. that can be used to further increase productivity and presentation quality. When it comes to the back-end all operations are handled efficiently using event-loop. The aggregates are retrieved in JSON format and MongoDB can be naturally quiered using jQuery like notation. This all results in complete and efficient solutioon.

\subsection{Choice}

Node.js has been chosen for the front-end and back-end development because
\begin{itemize}
  \item it integrates well with MongoDB
  \item enables using one language for everything (front-end, back-end, database);
  \item is efficient 
\end{itemize}

\section{System design}

\section{Query language}

\subsection{Elements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{source documents} (e.g. Committee of Experts reports)
  \item \emph{document specifiers} (e.g. cycle, country producing the document)
  \item \emph{selectors} (i.e., languages, sections, words)
  \item \emph{organizer} specifying how to structure the output document (e.g. arrange by section numbers, in each section by countries alphabetically)
  \item \emph{template} choose how to style the output document
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dependencies as tree}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Source documents} must be root.
  \item \emph{Document specifiers} can be children of each another, but can occur only once on any path from root to leaves, can appear multiple times.
  \item \emph{Selectors} (i.e. languages, sections, words) can be children of any node, and they are always terminal (leaves).
  \item \emph{Organizers}, \emph{templates}, and other similar options which can be added in the future must be children of root, and in case of \emph{organizers} they must be aware of all root's children except itself to display available options.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Query evaluation stages}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Select relevant documents using:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item producer - group (e.g. committee)
    \item producer - origin, i.e. countries (e.g. UK)
    \item cycles - time (e.g. last)
  \end{itemize}
  \item filter the document content using selectors (i.e. sections, languages, filters- words, phrases, etc.)
  \item reorganize resulting JSON using organizers
  \item render using template
\end{enumerate}
