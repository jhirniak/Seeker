0. Hello everyone, I am going to present <q>Seeker</q> project on which I and Kyriakos worked for the last 8 weeks.
1. The Project name came from a poem by George Campbell Hay called <q>Seeker, Reaper</q> of which part you can see scrolling on the screen.

---

# Seeker - Idea

###0. Gathering aggregate data out of many sources and documents for research or analysis is hard and daunting.
###1. Humans are very good in creative work, but do not like repetitive tasks.
###2. But! Computers love boring and repetitive work.
###3. So, why not let computer do all the boring work?

<hr/>

###**Idea:** build application that mines documents from specified websites, parses them, and saves them into database, providing query functionality that generates aggregate documents out of relevant documents' sections stored in database (and eventually provides some analysis / meta-data).

---

# Seeker - Internship Goals

###But, it is long-term idea, requiring lots of work, so for 8 week internship goals need to be cut down to match up with the reality.

<hr/>

##Internship goals:
###0. Carry out research and recommend on appropriate (open-source) tools.
###1. Implement proof of concept using EU Committee on Minority Language reports.
###2. Develop documentations alongside implementation allowing for **painless** continuation of work.

???


---

# To be continued...

###This project is very likely to be continued as it responds to real need and demand of researches and can find others application as well.

###The ultimate goal of the internship was to present proof of concept to show the idea feasibility.

---

# Collaborative effort

###This project was developed in collaboration with Celtic & Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh, where researches would be really interested in using such a tool for their language research and study.

###Especially, Prof Rob Dunbar, Chair of Celtic Languages,Literatures, History & Antiquities, provided lots of feedback and useful information through user requirements gathering, and providing feedback on the presented prototypes.

# Stage 1 - Mock Website

.big-image[![User requirement: Query](static/images/prototype.png)]

???

Mock website was created faking all actions, and being quite crude (at this stage). It was used to specify exactly the user needs, and the way user would like to interact with the interface.

---

# Stage 2 - Goals identification

0. Easy to continue development:
  - well-documented,
  - well-organized codebase.
1. Adaptable.
2. Open source.
3. Intuitive:
  - easy to grasp for people without computing background,
  - hinting every time when user may need help.
4. Query as a tree:
  - gives idea how generated document will be structured,
  - easy to grasp,
  - expressive,
  - handles many dependencies right-away.
5. Graceful fail - no mistake should lead to a disaster, e.g. providing undo/redo buttons for query specification stage.
6. Should be able to parse and generate popular format documents (e.g. .doc, .pdf, .rtf).
7. Minimal amount of user work (e.g. remember past queries, user/admin panels).
8. Gather feedback - provide a way to send feedback from the website.

???

Selected, and most important goals.

1. Adaptable - should be easy to adopt to different document format or source.

**Tree-structure** because it resembles how generated documents looks like, so provides idea of what is going to be generated, and how everything is going to be laid out.

**Help** was provided using hinting (displayed when user hovers for >1s) and manual page.

**Language** should not use works like <q>or</q> or <q>and</q> in confusing way.

**Lots of work** from **downloading and parsing documents into JSON**, **storing them in database**, **indexing, etc.***, **developing actual life web-application**.

---

# Stage 3 - Deciding on software stack
Ideal software stack should be
  - productive (develop and deploy with ease and fast) because project is constrained by time,
  - modern, but application should not fail on older browsers,
  - popular,
  - up to the task (e.g. fast schemaless database).

<hr/>

Hence, the stack of choice was **MEAN = MongoDB + Express.js + AngularJS + Node.js**.
Advantages:
  - one language (JavaScript) for all the code, and one data format (JSON),
  - robust and asynchronous - ideal for the kind of heavy queries expected,
  - productive - AngularJS helps with fast RESTful and MVC front-end development, and Express.js helps to handle all traffic with minimal effort,
  - up to task - MongoDB provides all features sought (can store arbitrary documents, is as fast as MySQL or PostgreSQL, has rich enough query language)
  - and many, many, more...

# Why nothing more standard? Would not that work?

- Relational database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL are too restrictive for documents. EU Minority Language committees reports have common structure, but still they differ significantly - some are missing section numbers in chapters, number of chapters/sections/paragraphs is arbitrary, and not to mention that project is supposed to be adaptable. Traditional relation database is too restrictive with its schema and that would be daunting task to overcome, if not impossible, while MongoDB provides all needed features out of the box, with similar query power as SQL DBMS, and similar performance.

- Python and Django/Flask, Java and Tomcat, or any other create makes distinction from client and server side code brutal as it is often written in different languages, and it is harder to make separate pieces to work together, with MEAN where only JavaScript is used all comes with greater easy, and that is much better for this project productivity.

---

# Why were those good choices?

###Yes!

- Planned work was accomplished because work was very productive.
- Project is well structured and codebase clean.
- Work was very productive.
- Project is modular and easy to modify/extend.
