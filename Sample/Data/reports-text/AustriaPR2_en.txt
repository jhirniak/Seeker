INTRODUCTION
On 5 November 1992, Austria signed the “European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages“, drawn up by the Council of Europe. However, the “Charter” only
became effective under international law on 1 March 1998, after the fifth State had
ratified it. As far as Austria is concerned, the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages went into force on 1 October 2001. The first monitoring cycle
was completed when the Recommendations of the Ministerial Committee were
adopted on 19 January 2005.
The purpose of the Charter is to protect and to promote the European regional and
minority languages as part of Europe’s cultural heritage. The Charter only covers
languages that are traditionally used within a given territory of a State by members of
a national minority. The Charter does not include dialects of the official language(s)
of a State or the languages of migrants.
In its ratification pursuant to Part II, Austria listed all six minority languages, which are
thus regarded as being protected in accordance with the objectives and principles of
the Charter. For the purposes of Part III of the Charter (i.e. that Part which requires
compliance with a minimum of 35 criteria), Burgenland-Croatian (as spoken in the
Burgenland-Croatian language territory in Burgenland, Slovene (as spoken in the
Slovene language territory in Carinthia) and Hungarian (as spoken in the Hungarian
language territory in Burgenland) were indicated. In addition, Austria has been able
to comply with many criteria from Part II of the Charter (although not the minimum of
35 criteria) for the Czech language (as spoken in the federal province of Vienna), the
Slovak language (as spoken in the federal province of Vienna), the Romany
language (as spoken in the federal province of Burgenland), the Slovene language
(as spoken in the federal province of Styria) and the Hungarian language (as spoken
in the federal province of Vienna).
The Burgenland-Croatian language is regarded as falling under terms of Part II of the
Charter for the region of Vienna, but does not meet any additional criteria, as Vienna
-8-

never constituted an autochthonous settlement area for the Burgenland-Croatian
language.
Austria now – in November 2007 – submits its Second Report to the Council of
Europe and sincerely regrets the delay in presenting the Report.
Whenever the Report uses person-related designations only in the male form, they
apply to women and men in the same manner.

1. General Situation and Framework Conditions
Austria regards the diversity of its population, of which the national minorities are a
part, as enriching for society as a whole.
§ 1 (2) of the National Minorities Act defines national minorities as “the groups of
Austrian citizens with another language than German as a mother tongue and their
own folklore tradition who live on and are natives of parts of the federal territory.”
The law therefore describes which groups meet these criteria and therefore
constitute national minorities. The Ordinance on National Minority Advisory Councils
specifies for which national minorities an advisory council is to be set up, namely:
-

the Burgenland-Croatian national minority
the Slovene national minority
the Hungarian national minority
the Czech national minority
the Slovak national minority
the Roma national minority

In the meantime, the expression “Volksgruppe” (= “population segment” Æ national
minority) has become largely accepted and can also be frequently found in
international contexts. It was chosen in 1976 mainly because of the reason that an
often discriminating shade of meaning was to be avoided that attaches to the
expression “Minderheit” (= minority), which was commonly used up to that time.
Although the State Treaty of St. Germain, State Law Gazette No. 303/1920 (Article
-9-

62 and following) and the State Treaty reconstituting an independent and democratic
Austria, Federal Law Gazette No. 152/1955 (Article 7, State Treaty of Vienna)
introduced and/or used repeatedly that concept, the present report uses the term
“Volksgruppe” (in the German version, standing for “national minority”), which is in
line with Austrian legal terminology. Of course, replacing an expression that appears
to be outdated, by a modern, more common expression does not change any of the
aforementioned obligations of Austria under international law.
The National Minorities Act only applies to the autochthonous minorities. As was
mentioned before, the Slovene national minority in Carinthia and Styria, the Croatian
national minority in Burgenland and in Vienna, the Hungarian national minority in
Burgenland and in Vienna, the Czech national minority and the Slovak national
minority in Vienna, as well as the national minority of the Roma in Burgenland have
been accepted as national minorities, as defined by the National Minorities Act.
According to the provisions of the National Minorities Act, in connection with the
ordinances on their implementation, indications and signs of a topographical nature,
which are put up by public authorities, must be produced in two languages in certain
areas. In addition, people are entitled to use the language of their national minority as
an official language before certain authorities and service units. Moreover, the
National Minorities Act stipulates that national minority advisory councils shall be set
up and that the national minorities shall be promoted. With regard to the Slovene
national minority in Carinthia and Styria and the Croatian national minority in
Burgenland, the right to bilingual instruction, official language and bilingual
topographical indications has also been laid down in Article 7 of the State Treaty of
Vienna.
Most autochthonous national minorities and/or their members have become very well
integrated into the majority population. However, the national minorities that are
traditionally native to Austria are faced with the problems of a shrinking number of
members, as well as over-ageing. The trend towards assimilation is reinforced by the
following circumstances: the small size of the national minorities in terms of absolute
numbers; the fact that they partly live in scattered settlement areas; the decease in
agrarian lifestyle and thus the increase in mobility and a mostly German-speaking
- 10 -

working environment; mixed marriages. Austria therefore supports the national
minorities in their efforts to maintain their cultures and languages by means of
promotional measures in the fields of the minority languages, the minority cultures
and the national minority media, as well as by improving the bilingual educational
system. In addition, the achievements of the churches (led by the Catholic Church,
and in case of the Hungarian national minority also the Protestant Churches, i.e. AB
= Augsburg denomination and HB = Helvetian denomination) are of great historical
and current importance in connection with maintaining and strengthening the national
minorities.
The structures of the national minorities are mainly supported by the organizations of
the national minorities, which are established on the basis of the statutory regulations
for associations, partly by the churches. The organizations of the national minorities
are associations which serve to maintain and secure the respective national minority,
its special customs and folklore, as well as its special characteristics and rights.
Foundations and funds under private law, which serve this purpose, are also
organizations of the national minorities. In practice, though, they hardly play any role.
Organizations of the national minorities are eligible to receive money from the budget
earmarked to promote the national minorities. To the extent that projects are
promoted that are specific of a national minority, the organizations of the national
minorities are on the same level as the churches and the religious denominations
(see § 9 of the National Minorities Act).

2. The Minority Languages Spoken in Austria:
The following minority languages are spoken in the autochthonous settlement areas:
-

Burgenland-Croatian in Burgenland

-

Slovene in Carinthia and Styria

-

Hungarian in Vienna and Burgenland

-

Czech in Vienna

-

Slovak in Vienna

-

Romany in Burgenland

- 11 -

A brief presentation is given below of the history and social situation of the national
minorities speaking the aforementioned languages:
2.1. The Croatian National Minority:
More than 450 years ago, Croats settled in what was then Western Hungary (and
today comprises Burgenland, the border region of Western Hungary, parts of Lower
Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic). After 1848 the development of a Croat
sense of identity became apparent. The fact that many people in Burgenland
commute to Vienna every day or every week, a development which started as early
as between the two World Wars, and the exodus from these areas have encouraged
assimilation tendencies among many Croats. In order to counteract the danger of
losing their Croat identity in a city as big as Vienna, the "Croatian-Burgenland
Cultural Association in Vienna" (Kroatisch-Burgenländischer Kulturverein in Wien)
was established in 1934, and – later on – the “Croatian Club of University Graduates"
(Kroatischer Akademikerklub), which has its registered office in Vienna. It was at a
very early stage that the Burgenland-Croats embarked on the road to integration and
did so in every respect, be it in the social, economic, professional or political field.
This enabled them to implement many measures required for maintaining and
cultivating their language and culture. Since the seventies, a growing number of
Burgenland-Croats, in particular young students, have become aware of their own
identity, and since the eighties, this has gradually and considerably improved their
linguistic and cultural situation and has led to a strengthening of their identity.
Today, Burgenland-Croats live in about 50 municipalities in Burgenland. According to
the group’s own estimates, the minority population numbers about 30,000. The
settlements are scattered as language islands all over the entire federal province.
There is no closed settlement area. In addition, some 12,000 Burgenland-Croats
(own estimates) live in Vienna.
During the last decade, numerous scientific studies were made on the situation of the
Burgenland-Croat population. Below, the most important results of these studies are
summarized briefly:

- 12 -

- In their age structure, the Burgenland Croats are clearly older than the rest of
the population (on average by 8 years) – the reason is mainly that the younger
generation no longer learns the Croatian language.
- For the Burgenland Croats the most important characteristic of their identity is
the language.
- The younger the interviewees, the stronger the appreciation for bilingualism
and thus of the Croatian language.
- In the course of the last three generations, a dramatic loss of language
competence within the family has appeared – only 27% of the parents who
themselves were raised bilingually use the Croatian language when speaking
to their own children.
- Burgenland Croats have an extremely strong “need for harmony” and – with
an overwhelming majority (82%) – consider their relations to the rest of the
population as “without any problems and harmonious”.
Opinions about the effect of bilingual municipal signs are divided within the
national minority: 47% think that it is “important” to put up bilingual topographical
signs, “as otherwise the identity of the Croats would not be acknowledged”; 46%
think that this is not the case. The experience in life with being bilingual is positive
– 48% of the commuters indicate that their bilingualism has helped them in their
occupational career; only 2% think that it was an obstacle. 50% state that their
bilingualism had “no influence”. Almost two thirds think that “it is once again
modern to use the Croatian language when speaking to their children”. About one
fifth of the Burgenland Croats think that “the Croatian language is a language for
old people”. This opinion is particularly widespread in the south of Burgenland.
The view is widespread that bilingual children have fewer difficulties in learning at
school – 68% of the Burgenland Croats shares this view. 50% of the interviewees
wish that their own children be taught in Croatian.
2.2. The Slovene National Minority:
Around 1,400 years ago, Slovenes (at first referred to as Alpine Slovenes) settled,
inter alia, in the regions of Carinthia and Styria; however, as a result of the
immigration and settlement of farmers from Bavaria and Franconia, which was
supported from the 9th century onwards by East-Franconian rulers, more and more
- 13 -

Slovenes had to retreat to south and south-east Carinthia and to the lower part of
Styria in the Middle Ages, in the course of mutual assimilation processes.
In the 15th century, a language boundary was thus established in Carinthia running
along the line of Hermagor – Villach – Maria Saal – Diex – Lavamünd; it largely
remained in place until the mid-19th century. The nationalist tendencies, which in the
mid-19th century also became apparent in Carinthia, created the basis for conflicts
with ethnic motivation. The development of tourism, industry and trade in the second
half of the 19th century fostered the use of the German language and enhanced the
assimilation process. Increasingly closer contacts between the Slovenes in Carinthia
and Slovenes in Carniola and other crown lands also contributed to an increased
ethno-political segregation. With the breakdown of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the
question of assigning nationality and of re-defining the boundaries of Carinthia
became topical issues. The Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated that two Carinthian
regions settled exclusively (Seeland) or largely (Mieß Valley) by Slovenes, be ceded
to Yugoslavia, on the one hand; it also called for a plebiscite to be held for
determining the main issue, namely whether South Carinthia should be part of
Austria or Yugoslavia, on the other hand. The result of the plebiscite, held on 10
October 1920, showed a 59% vote for Austria, meaning that the territorial unity of
Carinthia was essentially preserved. Prior to the plebiscite, the Provisional Regional
Assembly of Carinthia, in a resolution adopted on 28 September 1920, had appealed
to the Carinthian Slovenes, inter alia, committing itself to "maintaining the linguistic
and national identity of the fellow Slovene nationals now and at all times, as well as
showing the same care in promoting their intellectual and economic prosperity as
applied to the country's German inhabitants". According to estimates, approximately
12,000 Slovenes voted for Austria in the plebiscite.
In consequence, Austria's minority policy focused on Slovene issues in Carinthia.
Complaints were also submitted to the League of Nations. Several years of
negotiations in the second half of the 1920s, which aimed at creating cultural
autonomy for the Carinthian Slovenes, which implied, inter alia, a declaration of one's
affiliation to the "Slovene community" (as a "community of a public-law nature")
through an entry into the "Book of the Slovene People" (slowenisches Volksbuch),
- 14 -

did not bring any positive results. During the Nazi period, the Slovenes were
persecuted, and from 1942 onwards many were forced to re-locate.
During the post-war period, a broad ideological and political gap within the national
minority soon became apparent, which was due, inter alia, to the conflict between
Catholicism and Communism and to the territorial claims that were repeatedly raised
by Yugoslavia in respect of southern Carinthia until 1949, whereby the existence of
the Slovene minority was used as a justification. The latter issue was not finally
resolved until the State Treaty of 1955. Efforts aimed at implementing and extending
the rights of minorities and their protection, as enshrined in Article 7 of the State
Treaty of 1955, as well as at interpreting this provision have repeatedly been a topic
on the political agenda. Although it clearly emanates from the wording of the Treaty
that these rights do not only relate to the Slovenes in Carinthia, but to "the Slovene
and Croat minorities in Carinthia, Burgenland and Styria", disputes of a more
spectacular nature (due to the differing opinions about Article 7) have so far been
confined to the Carinthian region. Here, one should mention, in particular, the school
strike of 1958 against the hitherto - since 1945 - compulsory bilingual instruction, the
so-called municipal-signs conflict (Ortstafelstreit) of 1972 and the protests against the
secret mother-tongue survey of 1976. The deeper historical roots of the greater
conflict potential lie - no doubt – mainly in the historical territorial disputes outlined
above.
There are very different estimates concerning the number of person belonging to the
Slovene national minority in Austria. At the last census in 2001, a total of 17,953
persons of Austrian nationality indicated that Slovene was the language which they
used in everyday life. The reasons why these census results lack accuracy will be
discussed at a later point. It should be mentioned here, though, that scientific
investigations concerning the “Slovene-language skills”, which were conducted in the
political districts of Carinthia several years ago, arrived at the conclusion that
approximately 59,000 persons, aged 15 and more, have Slovene-language skills.
However, this does not mean that all these persons actually belong to the Slovene
minority. According to estimates made by the Slovene organizations, approximately
50,000 Slovene-speaking persons live in Austria.
- 15 -

Members of the Slovene national minority also live in Styria (see Austrian comments
in connection with Part II of the Charter).
As early as the beginning of the Middle Ages, there was a Slovene population on the
territory of today’s federal province of Styria. It lived in peace with its Germanspeaking neighbors. Both on this side of the border and on the other side of today’s
southern border of Styria, the Slovene population belonged mainly to the rural
population, whereas the middle classes in the towns and marketplaces were primarily
German-speaking.
On 1 December 1918, the “Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia” was solemnly
proclaimed in Belgrade. Already on 1 November Major Rudolf Maister had taken over
the powers of command in the town of Marburg/Maribor. Then, his troops advanced
northwards and occupied the bilingual region within a few weeks, including also
several German-speaking municipalities to its north (such as, for example, Mureck).
The army engaged in heavy fighting around the border municipalities of Soboth,
Leutschach, Spielfeld, Radkersburg and the surrounding municipalities. These
events left deep marks in the persons concerned and made life together difficult for
many decades. After the South Slavic troops had withdrawn, there was not only
persecution of those persons who had supported the occupiers, but the distrust
against all persons of Slovene mother tongue also grew.
On 10 September 1919, the new boundaries of the national territory were laid down
in the State Treaty of St. Germain between Austria and the former wartime
opponents of the collapsed monarchy. The southern boundary of Styria with the
newly founded South Slavic state (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia) was drawn in such a
way that parts of the bilingual region (such as, for example, Windisch Bühel – south
of Mureck – and Abstaller Feld) became part of Yugoslavia, whereas others (the
areas around Soboth, Leutschach and Radkersburg) became part of Austria. When
the border line was drawn, personal and economic relations were ruptured. As a
result of the border line many – both Austrian and Slovene – places lost their back
country, which accelerated the exodus movement.

- 16 -

After 1945, too, the old fears and suppression patterns were – regrettably – resumed.
When the German-speaking population was expelled from lower Styria and
Yugoslavia claimed territory from Austria, these anxieties were further kindled. The
bilingual population was thus in a dual predicament: Persons admitting that Slovene
was their mother tongue were readily suspected of being close, in ideological terms,
to Communist Yugoslavia. In addition, the bilingual population lost its cross-border
contacts more than ever before. Moreover, the economic situation of the bilingual
population also deteriorated in the cut-off border location. There was therefore a
massive exodus which, in turn, further decreased the bilingual population.
In 1988, the “Article VII Cultural Association for Styria” (Artikel VII Kulturverein für
Steiermark / Društvo člen 7 za avstrijsko) was founded. The association makes every
effort to implement the rights laid down in the State Treaty for the benefit of the
Slovene national minority in Styria. It regards its cultural center at Laafeld near
Radkersburg as a place of encounter between Slovenes and Austrians, on the one
hand, as well as a cultural center for the local monolingual and multi-lingual
population.
Since January 2004, a representative of the Slovene population in Styria belongs to
the National Minority Advisory Council for the Slovene national minority.
2.3. The Hungarian National Minority:
The predecessors of today's Hungarian national minority were early settlers whose
task was to protect the western border for the Hungarian kings. So-called settlements
of border guards still exist along the Hungarian border; place names such as
“Oberwart” and “Siget in der Wart” are reminders of their existence. In 1921, when
Burgenland became part of Austria, the Burgenland-Hungarians became a national
minority in Austria.
While the national minority was free to maintain contacts with Hungary during the
period between the two wars, the situation changed after World War II. As with the
Croats in Burgenland, the economic changes after 1945 led to an increased rural
exodus, as well as to weekly commuting; there was also a general tendency to parttime farming or seeking industrial work. This social change - in the same way as the
- 17 -

Iron Curtain - called into question the established value of Hungarian as a mother
tongue and led to a strong assimilation in language, which could only be
counteracted through intensive private educational efforts. As today many of the 30to 60-year-olds no longer have a command of Hungarian, the emphasis is rather on
bilingual work with children and juveniles. The fall of the Iron Curtain has had a very
positive effect for the Hungarian population in Burgenland. The fact that it is now
easier to be in contact with friends and relatives in Hungary has strengthened the
awareness of Burgenland-Hungarians for their language.
The current settlement area comprises the regions of Oberwart (Oberwart, Unterwart,
Siget in der Wart) and Oberpullendorf (Oberpullendorf, Mittelpullendorf). BurgenlandHungarians also live in larger municipalities and towns such as Eisenstadt or
Frauenkirchen, etc. Moreover, Hungarian families have lived in Graz and Vienna
already for many centuries.
The fact that today much larger numbers of Hungarians live in Vienna than in
Burgenland is partly due to the three big waves of emigrants and refugees from
Hungary in 1945, 1948 and 1956. After the fall of the “Iron Curtain” the inflow of
Hungarians increased and still continues. This must also be seen in the context of
Hungary’s accession to the European Union. At the 1991 census, 19,638 Austrian
nationals indicated that Hungarian is their everyday language. At the 2001 census
the figure was 25,884, of which 16,319 persons had been born outside of Austria.
In 1992, Vienna was also recognized as an autochthonous settlement area of the
Hungarian minority. Hungarian-language organizations indicate that, according to
their own estimates, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Hungarians live in Austria.
2.4. The Czech National Minority
Since the days when King Přemysl Otakar ruled the country, Czechs have settled in
Vienna. Towards the end of the 18th century, the waves of immigration ultimately
became so dramatic that proclamations were also published in Czech in the suburbs
of Vienna. The immigration wave reached its climax between 1880 and 1890, when
more than 200,000 Czechs, in particular workers and craftsmen, came to Vienna.
The majority of the Czech associations still in existence today were founded between
1860 and 1890. The Czech heyday in Vienna was certainly the period after the turn
of the century. At that time, Vienna was also the second-largest Czech city in the
- 18 -

world, its Czech population being outnumbered only by that of Prague. Despite
strong political resistance, the first independent Czech schools were established
during that period. Thanks to the great variety of Czech industries, crafts,
associations, banks, newspapers and the political parties, as well as to the extensive
social activities pursued by numerous associations, it was possible in those days to
use the Czech language almost exclusively for most aspects of everyday life.
Two big waves of repatriation after the two world wars reduced the number of
Czechs in Vienna by 50% each. Their numbers declined further until 1968, when the
figure reached its lowest point. As a result of the situation in Czechoslovakia in 1968
and 1969, many Czechs came to settle in Vienna. The Czech language community
increased again after the quelling of the "Prague Spring" of 1968/69 when 10,000
Czechoslovak citizens applied for political asylum in Austria.
Since 1945, the situation of the Czech population in Vienna has been characterized
by a strong dependence on the political situation in former Czechoslovakia, on the
one hand, and, on the other hand, by the fact that they have developed a certain
independence, which was also encouraged by the existence of the “Iron Curtain”.
The problem in the 1950s was that the minority was divided, one group maintaining
official contacts with the former Czechoslovakia and another, larger group refusing to
maintain Communist contacts. It was not until the 1990s that the two groups were reunited and agreed on the establishment of a common advisory council for the entire
Czech national minority at the Federal Chancellery. This step paved the way for a
certain internal correction of the image within the group, which especially encouraged
the involvement of younger members of the Czech minority and led to a number of
innovations.
As a result of the political changes in the ČSSR in November 1989, closer contacts
were established again between the Czech population in Vienna and in the Czech
Republic.
In the wake of the political changes in the CSSR in November 1989, the Czech
population living in Vienna and that of the Czech Republic once again developed
closer relations. The Czech national minority in Vienna, which has approximately
- 19 -

20,000 members, has gained further importance, on account of the opening to the
east. At the last census in 2001, 11,035 inhabitants of Vienna indicated that they use
Czech in everyday life. Estimates today fluctuate between 15,000 and 20,000
persons.
2.5. The Slovak National Minority:
The Slovak population in Austria is a small national minority that has lived in this
country for quite a long time. From the 5th to the 9th centuries, the eastern regions of
Lower Austria were part of the first state entities of early Slovaks. Linguistic and
ethnographic analyses indicate that there has been a continuous Slovak settlement
in these regions to this day. Approximately 25% of the Slovak minority lives in Lower
Austria. The largest part of the Slovak national minority (about two thirds) lives in
Vienna. Slovaks live in all districts of the town. There are, however, no
agglomerations and no compact Slovak-language islands. The remaining members
of the Slovak-speaking national minority are dispersed throughout Austria, most of
them living in Upper Austria and Styria.
Around 1900, the number of Slovaks in Austria reached its highest point
(approximately 70,000), with most of them living in Vienna and the Marchfeld region.
It rapidly declined thereafter to 20,000 around 1914 on what is today Austrian
territory.

Austria in the year 2001, 3,343 persons in all of Austria indicated that Slovak was
their everyday language, of which 1,015 were Austrian nationals. Of the registered
persons, 1,645 persons lived in Vienna and Lower Austria, of which 835 were
Austrian nationals. Slovak organizations estimate the number of persons belonging
to the Slovak national minority to amount to 5,000 to 10,000 persons.
A national minority advisory council along the law on national minorities was set up
for the Slovak national minority on 21 July 1992, when the Ordinance on National
Minority Advisory Councils (Federal Law Gazette No. 38/1977) was amended
(Federal Law Gazette No. 148/1992). The council convened for the first time in 1993.
- 20 -

2.6. The National Minority of the Roma:
Five larger groups of Roma can be distinguished in Austria today. These are in the
order of the length of their stay in the Central European, German-speaking area:
Sinti, Burgenland Roma, Lovara, Kalderaš and Arlije. The table below outlines the
history of their migration and the geographical parameters of these five groups.

"Country of emigration" means the last host country or country in which they stayed
before entering Austria. The table does not give precise figures. According to own
estimates by members of the national minority, some 25,000 Roma live in Austria
today. However, the numbers given by the various groups listed here differ to such
an extent that any specific indications would be unreliable. It should be mentioned,
though, that the number of Roma that have come Austria in search of work since the
60s – and who are mainly Austrian nationals today – is much higher by far than the
number of autochthonous Burgenland, Sinti, Roma and Lovara.
The different length of their stay on what is now Austrian territory has also led to
different socio-historical developments of the individual groups. While Roma migrant
workers were only slightly or hardly at all affected by the Nazi genocide, the
Burgenland Roma, Sinti and the Lovara are still suffering from this experience. The
generation of their grandparents, who played a decisive role in shaping the cultural
heritage and in passing it on to children and grandchildren, has been almost
extinguished in the concentration camps. This has had, inter alia, the effect of
destroying their social structure which is reflected, for example, in their large families,
- 21 -

and has dealt a heavy blow to these groups from which they have not yet fully
recovered to this very day. In fact, they have been unable to recover, as the liberation
of the few survivors did not put an end to their marginalization and discrimination.
(One must mention in this context that a politically motivated individual killed four
Roma at Oberwart on 4 February 1995. He was eventually sentenced with legal
effect.) The fact that the Austrian public takes a positive attitude towards Roma is,
inter alia, due to the fact that they have organized themselves following the
"Commemoration Year of Austria's Anschluss to the Third Reich" in 1988. In fact, the
first association of the Roma ethnic group took place in 1989. This was the Roma
association of Oberwart, which was directly triggered by the dissatisfaction of young
Roma who were denies access to public places and public events.
In 1988 the detainees of Lackenbach (the so-called “gypsy detention camp of
Lackenbach”) were given equal status with the other victims of the National-Socialist
regime,

as

defined

by

the

law

providing

assistance

to

Nazi

victims

(Opferfürsorgegesetz). During the last decades, public authorities – especially the
school authorities – have engaged in major supporting measures in order to
strengthen the feeling for their own value as the national minority of the Roma, on the
one hand, and to support their integration into society, on the other hand.
In 1993, the legal requirements for setting up an advisory council for the national
minority of the Roma were met; in fact, the council convened for the first time in
1995.

3. The Numerical Strength of the National Minorities:
The figures obtained at the most recent census, conducted in the year 2001, are
indicated below in order to give a general overview of the numerical strength of the
national minorities living in Austria. One must, however, clearly bear in mind that
these statistics can only provide approximate values, as the Austrian census does
not inquire about affiliation with a national minority, but about the language actually
used in everyday life. Multiple indications are admissible. The number of persons
using a specific language must, however, not be equated to the number of persons
- 22 -

belonging to a national minority. The national minorities themselves refuse to
participate in statistical investigations that ask for a commitment to a national
minority. The earlier possibility, contained in the National Minorities Act, i.e. to give a
confidential indication of one’s mother tongue, has now been abolished.

According to § 1 (3) of the National Minorities Act "the declaration that one belongs to
a national minority is .... free" and no-one is obliged to "prove his/her affiliation to a
national minority." If one also takes into account the fact that according to the legal
definition of the term "national minority" (§ 1 (2) of the National Minorities Act), the
relevant linguistic element is the mother tongue, and that in the national census
conducted every ten years under the National Census Act, the relevant question is
that of the language spoken in everyday life, it is obvious that there is currently no
legal possibility of obtaining precise figures regarding the members of the national
minorities. And since the term "everyday language" may give rise to different
interpretations, census results can be no more than an indication of the numerical
strength of a particular national minority. The entry into force of the law on register
censuses does not result in any change either. However, it is decisive that on
- 23 -

account of the register census law a secret census regarding the mother tongue is no
longer admissible, which the national minorities have always rejected.
Apart from regular census results, other indicators of the numerical strength of a
national minority are the existence and/or the reach of local minority associations, the
election results of groups (parties) and/or candidates addressing minority issues
(especially at the local level), the dissemination of mass media in the minority
language and certainly also the use of a minority language in church life. It is quite
obvious that almost all of these indicators depend on a variety of factors that are not
necessarily confined to national minorities and are thus, taken by themselves, not a
reliable source either.
Registrations for bilingual instruction need to be analyzed before using these figures
as an indication for the size of a national minority. It happens time and again that
monolingual children attend bilingual classes, whereas children of national minority
families for various reasons are not enrolled to attend such courses or do not register
for them at all. In Burgenland, though, where teaching classes bilingually has been
generally introduced in bilingual communities, the language spoken by pupils in
everyday life is indicated in school statistics. It is, however, inadmissible, at any rate,
to assign persons to an ethnic group.
The numerical strength of the Roma living in Austria is most difficult to indicate.
However, it can be assumed that the results of the census on the question of
everyday language is too low, compared to the number of Roma actually living in this
country. One may assume that several ten thousands of persons would have to be
assigned to the Roma in ethnical terms. The greater part of the population is the
result of recent migrations from eastern countries, who have settled outside the
autochthonous settlement area in Burgenland and can mainly be found in Vienna and
other big towns.

I. PART ONE:
I.1. The Legal Basis:
Merely for the sake of completeness, it is mentioned at the beginning that the
members of the national minorities in Austria – being Austrian nationals – enjoy the
same rights, especially political rights and fundamental rights, as all other nationals.
In addition, the Austrian legal system comprises specific legal provisions that relate
only to the national minorities.

I.1.1. Constitutional Provisions:
The following provisions relating to national minorities are of constitutional standing:
Article 8 (1) and (2) of the Federal Constitution Act:
“1. The German language shall be the official language of the Republic,
irrespective of any rights granted to the linguistic minorities by way of federal
law.
2. The Republic (federal, regional and municipal authorities) is committed to its
grown linguistic and cultural diversity which finds expression in the
autochthonous national minorities. The language and culture, existence and
maintenance of these national minorities shall be respected, secured and
promoted.”
Articles 66 to 68 of the State Treaty of Saint-German-en-Laye
of 10 September 1919, State Law Gazette No. 303/1920.
These provisions have constitutional standing in accordance with Article 149 (1) of
the Federal Constitution Act.
In addition to a ban on discrimination, Article 66 of the cited law contains a provision
on the free use of language: “No restrictions shall be imposed on Austrian nationals
regarding the free use of any language in private or business transactions, in matters
of religion, the press or of any kind of publications or public gatherings.”
Article 67 of the cited law guarantees the right of the national minorities “to establish
charitable, religious or social institutions, schools and other educational facilities, as
well as to operate and monitor them, with the right to use their own language and
their religion freely and at their discretion in these institutions and facilities.”
- 25 -

Article 68 of the cited law provides, inter alia, that the national minorities shall also
share in the financial means of the state, “for example for educational, religious or
charitable purposes.”
Article 7 of the State Treaty for the Restoration of an Independent and
Democratic Austria (State Treaty of Vienna)
Federal Law Gazette No. 152/1955; Article 7, items 2 to 4, has constitutional
standing in accordance with Article II, item 3, of the amendment of the Federal
Constitution Act, Federal Law Gazette No. 59/1964. It reads as follows:

“Article 7. Rights of the Slovene and Croatian minorities
1. Austrian nationals of the Slovene and Croatian minorities in
Carinthia, Burgenland and Styria shall enjoy the same rights on the
basis of the same conditions as they apply to all other Austrian
nationals, including the right to have their own organizations, gatherings
and a press in their own languages.
2. They shall have the right to receive elementary instruction in Slovene
and Croatian and to have a proportionate number of their own
secondary-level schools. In this connection, the curricula of schools
shall be reviewed, and a department shall be set up with the school
inspection authority for the Slovene and Croatian schools.
3. In the administrative and court districts of Carinthia, Burgenland and
Styria with a Slovene, Croatian or mixed population, the Slovene or the
Croatian languages are admitted as official languages, in addition to the
German language. In those districts, the signs and indications of a
topographical nature shall be produced both in the Slovene or Croatian
languages, as well as in German.
4. Austrian nationals of the Slovene and Croatian minorities in
Carinthia, Burgenland and Styria shall participate in the cultural,
administrative and court institutions of these regions on the basis of the
same conditions as they apply to other Austrian nationals.
5. The activities of organizations aiming at depriving the Croatian or
Slovene population of their characteristics and rights as minorities shall
be prohibited.”

§ 1 of the Minorities’ School Act for Burgenland
Federal Law Gazette No. 641/1994 in the version of Federal Law Gazette I No.
136/1998
Article 14 of the ECHR
It should be noted, in particular, that the European Convention on Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) has constitutional standing in Austria. Any alleged
violation of one of the rights, granted by the Convention, can therefore be challenged
directly before the Constitutional Court. Article 14 of the ECHR is of particular
importance in this connection, as it ensures that the enjoyment of rights guaranteed
by the ECHR shall be secured without any discrimination, especially with regard to
language.
In its case law (file number VfSlg. 2459/1952 and others) the Constitutional Court
holds the view that Article 19 of the Basic State Law on the General Rights of
Citizens for the Kingdoms and Countries Represented in the Imperial Council
(Imperial Law Gazette 1867/142) has been replaced by Articles 66 to 68 of the State
Treaty of St. Germain, in conjunction with Article 8 of the Federal Constitution Act.
Article 19 of the Basic State Law reads: “(1) All ethnic entities of the State shall have
equal rights, and every ethnic entity has the inviolable right to maintain and preserve
its nationality and language. (2) The equal right of all languages customarily used in
a country in schools, before authorities and in public life shall be recognized by the
State.”
The concept of “ethnic entities” related to the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian
Monarchy. Since 1920, in the Republic, there are no longer ethnic entities, but
minorities. There is therefore no scope for applying Article 19 of the Basic State Law.

I.1.2. Simple-Law Provisions and Ordinances
The following legal instruments were adopted as laws by simple majority or as
ordinances:

- 27 -

National Minorities Act, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1976 in the version of
Federal Law Gazette I No. 35/2002:
According to § 1 (2) of the National Minorities Act, national minorities are defined as
“as the groups of Austrian citizens with another language than German as a mother
tongue and their own folklore tradition who live on and are natives of parts of the
federal territory”. Today, the Slovene national minority in Carinthia and Styria, the
Croatian national minority in Burgenland, the Hungarian national minority in
Burgenland and in Vienna, the Czech national minority in Vienna, the Slovak national
minority in Vienna, as well as the Roma national minority in Burgenland are regarded
as national minorities as defined by the National Minorities Act.
The federal law of 7 July 1976 on the legal status of national minorities in Austria
(National Minorities Act) has, first of all, the function of a law that implements Article 7
of the State Treaty of Vienna (except for the legislative provisions on schools, which
are incorporated in the minorities’ school laws for Burgenland and Carinthia), and,
secondly, it created the legal basis for setting up the national minority advisory
councils and the financial promotion of the national minorities; thirdly, the law is not
restricted in its scope of application to the Croatian and the Slovene minorities, but
on account of its definition of the term “national minority” it subsequently made it
possible to apply the law to the Hungarian national minority, the Czech national
minority, the Slovak national minority and the Roma national minority.

A national minority advisory council has been set up at the Federal Chancellery for
each of the six autochthonous national minorities. The task of the advisory councils is
to advise the Federal Government and the Federal Ministers in matters relating to the
national minorities. They must maintain and represent all cultural, social and
economic interests of their national minority and, in particular, they shall be heard
prior to the adoption of legal provisions and on general plans in the field of promotion.
They can submit proposals for the improvement of the situation of the national
minorities and their members. In particular, the national minority advisory councils
- 29 -

shall also make recommendations on the distribution of the funds from the budget for
the promotion of the national minorities (see Chapter II of the National Minorities Act).
In keeping with the provisions of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
implementing ordinances, indications and signs of a topographical nature, which are
affixed by public authorities in certain areas, shall be produced in two languages, and
there is the right to use the language of the national minority as an official language
before certain authorities.

I.1.3. Case Law

The following decisions by the highest courts in the country give an overview of the
present case law:
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 9 March, file number G 2-4/00-7:
In this decision, the Constitutional Court stated that “elementary instruction”, as
mentioned in Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna, which has constitutional
standing, is meant to refer to the first four grades of schools. Classes must therefore
be taught in two languages in the schools of relevance in this connection. The
Constitutional Court explained in its decision that elementary instruction in the
Slovene language is no longer ensured if Slovene is taught only as a compulsory
subject – like any other foreign language – whereas the other subjects are taught
only in German.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 4 October 2000, file number V 91/99-11:
In this decision, the Constitutional Court stated in connection with the use of the
Slovene language as an official language that an administrative district, as defined by
Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna, which has constitutional standing, is
also meant to refer to a municipality. In the reasons explaining the decisions it is
stated that an administrative district with a “mixed population”, as defined in Article 7,
item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna, certainly relates to a municipality coming under
the purview of this provision if the share of the Slovene-speaking population in the
- 30 -

total population amounts to 10.4% - as is the case with the municipality of Eberndorf,
which gave rise to the present court case.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 13 December 2001, file numbers G 213/01-18,
V 62, 63/01-08:
(With regard to topographical indications and signs), municipalities are also
considered as “administrative districts with a mixed population”, as defined in Article
7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna. In the reasons which the Constitutional Court
gave for its decision, the court stated that a municipality (as is the case with the
municipality of St. Kanzian am Klopeiner See which gave rise to the present court
case) is an “administrative district with a mixed population” whenever – seen over a
longer period of time – the percentage of the minority population has been more than
10%.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 27 June 2002, file number B 1230/01:
In this decision, the Constitutional Court dealt with the question whether an
autonomous bilingual primary school can be transformed into an autonomous school
branch of a merely German-speaking primary school. The Constitutional Court stated
that there is compliance with Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna if a/any
bilingual primary school exists in a bilingual municipality for the pupils belonging to
that school district. The organizational structure according to school law does not
matter in this connection.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 9 October 2004, file number B 9/03:
In the reasons given for this decision the Constitutional Court explained that the State
Treaty of Vienna shall only be applied directly – also as a yardstick in review
proceedings for laws and ordinances – if there are no implementing provisions
stipulated as simple laws.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 14 December 2004, file number V 131/03:
With its decision the Constitutional Court dismissed an individual application by
members of the Slovene minority in Carinthia, as the members of the minority group
did not have the subjective right to submit the application for topographical signs in
two languages.
- 31 -

The second sentence of Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna, which has
constitutional standing, only contains an obligation under international law of the
Republic of Austria and/or an “order” to its bodies “to produce” topographical signs
and indications in the manner thus required. However, one cannot derive a right of
individual persons from the second sentence of Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty
of Vienna – for lack of a sufficiently individualized interest of the party in compliance
with this objective constitutional stipulation (similar decisions were taken by the
Constitutional Court on 10 October 1984, file number B 629/78, and on 9 October
1004, file number B 9/03).
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 12 December 2005, file number V 64/05 and
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 26 June 2006, file number V 20/06:
In these decisions the Constitutional confirmed its earlier rulings, as they are
expressed in the decision of 13 December 2001. In the latter decision the court
specified that a municipality may also lose its character as a “mixed-language
administrative district” if – as in the case in question – the Slovene-speaking part of
the residential population was below 10% at the most recent two censuses and if
there is a downward trend.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 13 December 2006, file number V 81/06-14:
When giving the reasons for this decision, which repealed various text passages in
an ordinance of the road police, the Constitutional Court stated that it is unlawful to
affix the Slovene-language topographical name on a (smaller) separate sign. In
places where the topographical signs and indications must be produced and/or
affixed both in the Slovene and the German language, the provisions of the road
traffic code require that both the German and the Slovene name of the place must be
given on the road sign “topographical indication” and/or “end of topographical
indication” and not on a separate sign.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 13 December 2006, file number V 54/06 and
others:
The Constitutional Court established that the ordinance of the Federal Government
dated 31 May 1977 concerning provisions on sections of regions in which
- 32 -

topographical signs must be affixed in both the German and Slovene language,
Federal Law Gazette No. 306/1977 in the version of Federal Law Gazette II No.
37/2002, is unlawful, as it more or less excludes the affixing of bilingual topographical
indications in municipalities located in other political districts than the ones mentioned
in the ordinance and/or for other municipalities than the ones mentioned for the
political district of the larger Klagenfurt area (Klagenfurt-Land).

I.2. Statutory Organizations of the National Minorities:
In accordance with § 3 of the National Minorities Act, advisory councils shall be
established for the different national minorities within the Federal Chancellery which
shall advise the Federal Government and the Federal Ministers in matters concerning
the national minorities. Their task is to maintain and to represent all cultural, social
and economic interests.
An advisory council has been set up for each national minority. Any correspondence
with an advisory council may be addressed to the administrative office of the advisory
councils: Advisory Council for the Respective National Minority, Administrative Office,
Federal Chancellery, Department V/6, Ballhausplatz 2, A-1014 Vienna.

I.3. Measures in accordance with Article 6 of the Charter:
First, the Charter in question – being a state treaty according to Article 50 of the
Federal Constitution Act – was published in the Federal Law Gazette. It can also be
accessed on the web site of the Austrian Federal Chancellery, together with
comments, at http://www.bka.gv.at/site/3517/default.aspx. Moreover, during the
ratification process, the Charter was presented to the advisory councils of the
national minorities. In addition, the Charter was also the subject of a consultation
procedure. For this purpose, the Charter was brought to the attention of all bodies
that might be affected by it.

- 33 -

The First Report and the Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe, dated 19 January 2005, were also published on the web site of
the Federal Chancellery.

I.4. Measures pursuant to the Recommendations of the Committee
of Ministers of the Council of Europe of 19 January 2005:
In connection with Austria’s First Report, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of
Europe recommended on 19 January 2005 that the following points, which are
summarized below, be addressed with priority:
- adopt a structural policy for the protection and promotion of the languages indicated
by Austria in the course of ratification, and to create conditions for their use in
public life;
- ensure that the ruling of the Constitutional Court concerning Slovene as an official
language is implemented without delay;
- ensure that bilingual teaching takes place in practice in all relevant schools in
Burgenland;
- ensure that changes in the status of schools or in the rules regarding the
appointment of school staff in the Slovene-language area do not negatively affect
Slovene-language school education in Carinthia;
- ensure that the Burgenland-Croatian, Slovene and Hungarian languages can
actually be used before the relevant judicial and administrative authorities;
- increase radio broadcasting in the Burgenland-Croatian and Hungarian languages
and television broadcasting in Burgenland-Croatian, Slovene and Hungarian
languages.
The relevant passages in the Program of the Federal Government for the 23rd
Legislative Period (2007 – 2010) are cited at first, which read as follows:
- In the chapter on “Constitutional and Administrative Reform” the following was laid
down: “The increased linguistic and cultural diversity of Austria is reflected in the
autochthonous ethnic groups. Laws relating to the ethnic groups shall therefore be
an important element in the Constitution, and at the same time their scope shall be
- 34 -

extended to promote inter-cultural dialogue in accordance with the Convention of
the Council of Europe. The regulation of the implementation of decisions relating to
municipal signs made by the Constitutional Court shall be constitutionally
safeguarded with the maximum possible consensus from the ethnic groups, on the
basis of existing proposals. … This regulation will be implemented by the summer
of 2007.”
- The chapter on “Constitutional and Administrative Reform” continues: “Efforts shall
be made to incorporate a catalogue of the fundamental principles and the
fundamental aims of state policy at the beginning of the Constitution.” In this
connection, as well as in the context of national minorities, special reference is
made to Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution Act, which already contains a
stipulation on the fundamental aims of state policy.
- The chapter on “Education, Science” also addresses topics of relevance to the
national minorities. Whenever expert groups eventually discuss these topics in
connection with pre-school educational programs, attention will have to be paid, so
as to include the representatives of the national minorities in these deliberations.
- The chapter on “Media, Art, Culture, and Sport” emphasizes the promotion of a
cultural diversity. This means that when allocating promotional funding to the
national minorities, inter alia, special attention must be paid to the cited “intercultural dialogue” and that the specific concerns of the national minorities must be
taken into account in the cited political areas.
- The last-mentioned chapter of the Government Program also states that the
science group will be assigned the task of dealing with the past in a more
responsible manner. In this context, specific aspects of the national minorities will
also have to be taken into account.
The efforts of Austria concerning the protection and promotion of the languages
indicated when ratifying the European Charter for the Regional or Minority
Languages have resulted in a large number of measures which are described in
detail in the report under the different articles of the Charter.
- 35 -

With regard to the implementation of the so-called “official-language” decision of the
Constitutional Court, it is pointed out that, according to the present legal situation
there are linkages between the area of application of bilingual topographical signs
and indications and the scope of application of an official language. On 4 July 2007 a
government bill was submitted to the National Council (file number XXIII.GP-NR
263/A) concerning a federal law amending the National Minorities Act. The bill
formulates the new regulations for bilingual topographical signs and indications. One
will have to wait for the requisite decisions in the National Council, which will be of
relevance for the aforementioned linkages to regulations on official language.
With regard to ensuring bilingual teaching in practice in all relevant schools in
Burgenland, the following comments, in particular, are made: The curriculum of
primary schools (primary-school classes), where the Croatian language or the
Croatian and German languages are the languages of instruction, is governed by the
educational and teaching obligations, as well as the teaching material and didactic
principles for the compulsory subjects taught in primary schools. The provisions of
the respective syllabus of a primary school (part seven) applies to the teaching of
German, reading, mathematics, music education, art education, writing, manual-skills
education and physical exercises, with the proviso that the teaching (except for
German, reading and writing) must be offered in almost equal parts in the Croatian
and German languages, in compliance with the previous knowledge obtained by the
children.
The case law of the Constitutional Court, which is described in detail in the course of
the report, ensures that changes in the status of schools or a change in the
appointment regulations of school staff in the bilingual Slovene-language area do not
negatively affect school education in the Slovene language in Carinthia.
By the same token, the internal organizational measures and steps taken by the
authorities ensure that the Burgenland-Croatian, Slovene and Hungarian languages
can actually be used before the relevant court and administrative authorities.
Moreover, Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna apply directly in certain
cases.
- 36 -

In connection with expanding radio broadcasts in the Burgenland-Croatian and
Hungarian languages and television programs in the Burgenland-Croatian, Slovene
and Hungarian languages, reference is made to proceedings in a complaint case,
which are currently pending, concerning a violation of the obligation contained in § 5
of the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation Act, which stipulates that commensurate
parts of the broadcast programs must be produced in the languages of the national
minorities. The decision in this matter will provide major clarification as to the factual
and legal situation.

- 37 -

II. PART TWO: OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
PURSUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 2,
PARAGRAPH 1
II.1. Recognition of Regional or Minority Languages (Article 7,
paragraph 1(a)):
Compliance with this provision, as stipulated in the Austrian legal system, is
documented through the notification of two Declarations by the Republic of Austria
which relate to the scope of application of the Charter, as well as to the ratification of
the Charter in the light of the Declarations.

II.2. Respect of the Geographical Area (Article 7, paragraph 1 (b)):
The Austrian administrative divisions do not constitute an obstacle to the protection of
the minority languages and can be considered as being at least “neutral” in this
respect. Special promotional measures are also provided for specific languages such
as, for example, defining specific school districts entitling pupils to bilingual teaching in
the minorities’ school system. In this context, attention should also be drawn to the
case law of the Constitutional Court (file number VfSlg. 9224/1981), according to which
a re-definition of constituencies to the detriment of a minority is not compatible with the
principle of equality.

II.3. Resolute Action to Promote Regional and Minority Languages
(Article 7, paragraph 1 (c)):
Already before the entry into force of the Charter, the existing legislation on the
protection of national minorities contained rights for the national minorities with regard
to their promotion (see comments with regard to Part III of the Charter). Concrete
(financial) support measures benefiting all the minority languages listed in Austria’s
Declarations are enshrined, above all, in Article 8 and following of the National

Minorities Act. At present, the Federal Government pays out approximately EUR 3.8
million under the budget item “promotion of national minorities”.
With their financial funding, the Federal Government and the regional governments, as
well as the municipalities make major contributions so that the members of the national
minorities are in a position to preserve and further develop their cultural heritage.

II.3.1. Development of Funding by the Federal Chancellery for the
Promotion of the National Minorities:
State funding, in particular, helps to maintain the cultural heritage and to further
develop the culture. Since the entry into force of the National Minorities Act, the
financial assistance provided by the Federal Chancellery for the promotion of the
national minorities has developed as follows:
1977:
1978:
1979:
1980:
1981:
1982:
1983:
1984:
1985:
1986:
1987:
1988:
1989:

ATS 5 million
ATS 5 Million
ATS 5 Million
ATS 5 million
ATS 5 million
ATS 5 million
ATS 5 million
ATS 4.25 million
ATS 3.825 million
ATS 5 million
ATS 4.850 million
ATS 4.462 million
ATS 14.35 million

The considerable increase in the year 1989 is due to the fact that the Slovene National
Minority Advisory Council was set up in that year.
1990:
1991:
1992:

ATS 20.35 million
ATS 24 million
ATS 34 million

The increase in promotional funding in the early nineties is due to the expansion of the
National Minority Advisory Council for the Hungarian national minority by including the
Hungarian population of Vienna, the setting up of the National Minority Advisory
Council for the Slovak minority (constituting session in May 1993), the setting up of the
- 39 -

National Minority Advisory Council for the Croatian national minority (constituting
session in August 1993) and the setting up of a National Minority Advisory Council for
the Czech national minority (constituting session in May 1994).
1993:
1994:
1995:

ATS 37.8 million
ATS 39.8 million
ATS 52.72 million

The originally budgeted amount of ATS 42.72, as contained in the 1994 government
bill, was increased by ATS 10 million to ATS 52.72, on account of the fact that the
Roma national minority, in particular, needed financial assistance in order to catch up.
The Roma National Minority Advisory Council had its constituting session on 5
September 1995.
1996:
1997:
1998:

ATS 52.72 million
ATS 52.72 million
ATS 52.72 million, plus an additional ATS 15 million which were used to
promote radio programs for the national minorities.

1999:

ATS 51.848 million, plus an additional ATS 15 million which were used to
promote radio programs for the national minorities.

2000:

ATS 51.848 million, plus an additional ATS 10 million were used to
promote radio programs for the national minorities.

2001:
2002:
2003:
2004:
2005:
2006:
2007:

EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million
EUR 3.768 million

Every year, the full amount of the annual promotional budget is spent. It should be
mentioned that, in contrast to most other items for promotional funding in the budget, it
has been possible to maintain the promotional funding for the national minorities
essentially on the same level since 1995, without any budget cuts. It was only in the
years 1998 to 2000 that the sum was increased, as the radio programs for the national
minorities were promoted. This financial assistance was subsequently replaced by the
options offered by the amended Austrian Public Broadcasting Act (Federal Law

- 40 -

Gazette I No. 83/2001), on account of the newly established program mandate in favor
of the national minorities.
The organizations of the national minorities receive considerable financial support from
the budget available for promotional funding in order to maintain the language and
culture of the respective national minority. The general trend with national minorities is
that of a difficult restructuring phase, in account of the fact that the population is
decreasingly ready to join associations as active or passive members and that the
national minorities are becoming increasingly over-aged. Without the availability of
promotional funding for the national minorities, efforts would be much more difficult to
achieve, namely to attach also the younger segment among the members of the
national minorities on a lasting basis to the national minorities and thus to implement
the objectives of the National Minorities Act, which are to maintain and preserve the
national minorities. The organizations of the national minorities must set priorities and
must offer an attractive cultural and language program. In most cases, they are able to
accomplish this goal only by utilizing to the promotional funding for the national
minorities.
Beyond the cultural aspect, the promotional funding for the national minorities is also
deployed in a constructive manner, as it contributes towards raising the level of
command of the languages of the national minorities. As almost all the languages of
the national minorities are official languages of the European Union, members of the
national minorities with a good level of education in their mother tongue are also a
major potential for Austria as an economic and cultural location.

II.3.2. Criteria for the Distribution of Promotional Funding

Many factors need to be taken into account in order to fairly distribute the total amount
of money among the six national minorities.
Increases in the budget for promotional funding, due to the fact that new national
minority advisory councils were set up led, as a rule, to an increase in the funding for

- 41 -

those national minorities, for which national minority advisory councils had been set up
for some time already.
The National Minorities Act defines the objective of promotion as “to maintain and
secure the existence of the national minorities, their folklore, as well as their
characteristics and rights.” The National Minorities Act does not provide for
promotional funding to individual persons but to organizations of the national minorities
which organize specific activities for their respective national minority. In consequence,
this means that the amounts of funding in their relation to the different national
minorities is not determined by a head count (to be determined in whatever form), but
that the actual need for promotional funding for the specific activities of the respective
national minorities, offered by the organizations of the national minorities, and the
demand for these activities, are the decisive criteria. One reason why a distribution of
the promotional funding according to quotas is difficult to achieve is the fact that it is
difficult to establish the number of members of the national minorities, as the national
census only inquired about the language used in everyday life, and as future national
censuses according to the Register Calculation Act will no longer automatically inquire
about the everyday language. It should also be mentioned that not all members of
national minorities have the same interest in participating in the activities available to
their respective national minority, as well as that the need of the national minorities for
specific activities is determined by different political and social framework conditions.
Furthermore, the national minorities have different additional possibilities to obtain
funding from other sources.
It should be mentioned, last but not least, that in line with self-determination, every
member of a national minority is free to become integrated into an organization of
his/her national minority and to inquire about its activities, or to refrain from any active
attachment to or participation in the organizations of the national minorities.
Just like all other promotional funding schemes, the promotion of the national
minorities serves the general goal of facilitating the implementation of projects for
which the financial means of the interested population segment would not be sufficient
and which it would thus be impossible to implement without public funding. In the field
of promoting the national minorities, this applies, by way of example, to research
activities regarding the national minorities such as, for example, research into historical
- 42 -

sources, applied scientific studies on the learning of a second language, the
codification of and teaching methods for the varieties of the Romany language spoken
in Austria.
It is worth mentioning that the profiles of the needs of the six national minorities are
surprisingly different. The Roma national minority, for example, has set other priorities,
on account of the more difficult social and educational situation than national minorities
that must mainly fight over-ageing and assimilation and search for attractive ways in
which to create a sustainable interest among the younger segment of the national
minority for the language and culture of the national minority.
On the occasion of several discussions on the political level with the chairpersons and
the deputy chairpersons of the national minority advisory councils, it was pointed out
expressly that – for reasons of budget consolidation – it would not be possible to
increase the promotional funding for the national minorities. The chairpersons and
deputy chairpersons of the national minority advisory councils were therefore asked to
increasingly establish priorities and, accordingly, to submit recommendations for
promotional funding to the Federal Chancellery in a weighted structure according to
facts. The Federal Chancellery would consider a different approach to distributing the
budget for promotional funding among the national minorities if a fact-based
justification were submitted which, in particular, could be a joint proposal by the
national minority advisory councils to this effect.

II.3.3. Statutory Basis for Providing the National Minorities with
Promotional Funding

Chapter III of the Federal Law of 7 July 1976 on the Legal Status of the National
Minorities in Austria, Federal Law Gazette 1976/396 (National Minorities Act), is the
statutory basis for providing the national minorities with promotional funding. § 1 (2) of
the National Minorities Act defines “national minorities in the meaning of the present
federal law as the groups of Austrian citizens with another language than German as a
mother tongue and their own folklore tradition who live on and are natives of parts of
the federal territory”.
- 43 -

§ 8 of the National Minorities Act stipulates: “The Federal authorities shall promote –
irrespective of general promotional measures – the measures and projects that serve
to maintain and secure the existence of the national minorities, their folklore and
traditions, as well as their characteristics and rights.”
According to § 9 (2) of the National Minorities Act “associations, foundations and funds
that serve to maintain and secure a national minority, its specific folklore and tradition,
as well as its characteristics and rights (organizations of the national minorities)”, as
well as “churches and religious denominations, together with their institutions” –
paragraph (3) - are eligible for receiving money from the budget available to promote
the national minorities.
According to § 9 (5) of the National Minorities Act, territorial corporations may only
receive financial funding under the National Minorities Act for such measures as are
necessary to implement provisions on topographical signs and official languages and
that exceed the economic capacities of the respective territorial corporation.

II.3.4. Process of Awarding Promotional Funding

At the beginning of every year, the Federal Chancellery sends out application forms to
the organizations of the national minorities and/or, in analogy, the churches – to the
extent that they are known to the Federal Chancellery as potential applicants for
promotional funding. In addition, the Federal Chancellery publishes the application
forms on its web site, indicating the deadline for applications. The purpose of the
deadlines for applications is to allow the Federal Chancellery and the members of the
respective national minority advisory councils to deal with the substance of the
applications before the meetings of the national minority advisory councils in which
they are called upon to issue their recommendations. Whenever organizations of the
national minorities are not yet known to the Federal Chancellery, or were newly
founded, evidence of the bylaws of the association is required when an application is
submitted.

- 44 -

According to § 10 (2) of the National Minorities Act the “responsible national minority
advisory council shall issue a recommendation by 15 March of every year …. on the
use of the promotional funding” (the so-called “recommendation for promotional
funding”) in connection with the individual applications for promotional funding.
Irrespective of the foregoing, the Federal Chancellery is responsible for checking the
applications with regard to the legal admissibility of applicants to receive grants and for
preparing the agreements on the grants.
The grants for the promotion of the national minorities are dispersed with the federal
authorities acting as the private-economic administrator of the money. According to §
11 of the National Minorities Act, the recipients of promotional funding must be
required by contract to report on the use of the money (a reporting form, which is part
of the agreement, is used for this purpose) and to provide proof of the payments (the
so-called “payment settlement”). The reports of the recipients of grants must be
brought to the attention of the respective national minority advisory council.
“Other grants” of a minor volume are also available in addition to the “grants on the
basis of the National Minorities Act”, for which the recommendations of the national
minority advisory councils must be obtained. “Other grants” are used to promote
special measures such as, for example, preparing teaching methods and codifying the
varieties of the Romany language spoken in Austria, or grants to support the printing
costs of publications by a specific national minority, or support for scientific research
projects relating to a specific national minority, as well as projects covering several
national minorities, or support for projects regarding a specific national minority, for
which, however, no application was filed by the organizations of the national minorities.
In addition, in past years budget funds assigned to specific expenses were covered
from the amount budgeted for “other grants” in order to avoid that these measures
affected the organizations of the national minorities. In many cases, though, the
promotional funding for the national minorities was excluded from assigning budget
funds to specific expenses – as a token of the special appreciation for the work done
by the organizations of the national minorities – and the amounts saved were debited
to other budget items in the Federal Chancellery.

- 45 -

II.3.5. Guidelines for Special Promotional Grants

Both the National Minority Advisory Council for the Hungarian Minority and the Court of
Audit suggested the publication of guidelines for special promotional grants. In the
beginning, the Federal Chancellery tried to take account of this request by drawing up
agreements – according to a uniform standard – for the promotional grants, which
were as detailed as possible and increased the legal certainty for the recipients of the
grants. In addition, the Federal Chancellery has made major efforts to test, together
with the advisory councils for the national minorities, pre-versions of texts for
guidelines in connection with special promotional grants for their practical use, which
are in the form of an information sheet enclosed with the application form for
promotional grants for national minorities, as well as to optimize them.
However, already when presenting the government bill for a law on the national
minorities, file number RV 217 BlgNR 14. GP, page 12, the difficulties encountered in
this connection were highlighted (“When describing the projects to be promoted, it was
practically impossible to give a list. The measures range from supporting the
publication of books and journals in the language of a national minority, to a variety of
cultural events and contacts. The common feature, though, of all of these projects,
which are to be supported in the framework of promoting the national minorities, is that
they are suited to contribute towards maintaining and securing the national minority
and its special characteristics and rights.”)
In December 2006 the advisory councils for the national minorities were formally
seized with a first draft for guidelines concerning special promotional funding. The
discussion process is being continued, taking account of the statements made by
some of the national minority advisory councils. The advisory councils of the national
minorities agreed to submit a joint position to the Federal Chancellery, which has not
been submitted to date.

II.4. Facilitating the Use of the Minority Languages (Article 7,
paragraph 1 (d)):

- 46 -

In conformity with Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, incorporated in
the Austrian Constitution, “the free use by any Austrian national of any language
in private or business transactions, in matters of religion, the press, or of any kind
of publications or at public gatherings” is guaranteed in Austria. As described
before in the chapter on the legal basis for the minority languages in Austria,
specific provisions govern the use of national minority languages as official
languages (in addition to German) before administrative authorities and the
courts (see also the comments in connection with Articles 9 and 10). In Austria
mechanisms to facilitate the use and promotion of minority languages are already
in place in the field of education and science, culture, as well as in economic and
social life. There a varying degrees of support for promoting the use of these
languages in education and science, on account of the different situations of
these languages. Details on the use of the minority languages in the fields
mentioned are provided in the comments regarding Part III of the Charter.

II.5. Maintenance and Development of Links (Article 7, paragraph 1
(e)):
The persons speaking minority languages in Austria are often organized in
associations of the respective national minorities, which are granted financial
support under the regime promoting national minorities pursuant to Article 8 and
following of the National Minorities Act. Assistance (particularly to the cultural
sector) also serves to foster the relations among groups speaking national
minority languages (but also contacts with the German-speaking population). This
provides a basis for promoting cultural exchange, strengthening relations in
general, as well as contributing together to the preservation and further
development of their languages.

II.6. Teaching and Learning of Minority Languages (Article 7,
paragraphs 1 (f), 1 (g), 1 (h)):
In Austria, the relevant measures for schools – in order to promote the Croatian
and the Hungarian languages – are laid in the Minorities’ Schools Act for
Burgenland, in particular, which also introduced provisions that take account of
- 47 -

the Romany language. Regulations concerning the Slovene language are above
all included in the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia. The Czech and Slovak
languages are mainly subject to Article 68 (1) of the State Treaty of St. Germain
(see comments in connection with Article 8).
Austria has a system of providing text books on an almost gratuitous basis. The
official text book lists also comprise the text books in the languages of the
national minorities. The maximum amount of the average costs per pupil is
determined by way of an ordinance, issued by the Federal Minister of Social
Affairs and Consumer Protection (in coordination with the Federal Minister of
Education, Arts and Culture). A special provision in this “ordinance on cost
ceilings” stipulates that “at schools with bilingual instruction (minorities’ school
system) text books in the second language in the scope (number of titles) per
pupil, as may be obtained for the comparable instruction in the German language,
may be purchased in addition to the maximum amounts for the German-language
text books.” Examples for the supply with teaching materials are the text books,
teaching aids and working materials for Slovene instruction in Carinthia that are
listed in the annex to this report. The pupils will get most of these materials under
the text book supply system, others are meant to be used as hand-outs for
teachers, and several others can be found on the Internet. For some subjects
taught at the three secondary schools, which are part of the minority school
system, (exclusively or partly) in the Slovene language, a full range of text books
in the Slovene language is not available. In recent years, though, the number of
books available has grown. However, on account of the very small number of
copies, it is not easy for publishing houses to produce text books in the Slovene
language and to offer them on the market at a low price.
In Austria everybody has the opportunity to learn the languages of the Austrian
national minorities, as the measures mentioned above are not limited to the
members of the national minorities but are available to the general public; the
only difference is that basically only the members of the national minorities have
specific legal rights to these measures.
Austrian universities also teach and conduct research on the languages of the
national minorities, i.e. Croatian, Slovene, Hungarian, Czech and Slovak. As far
as the language of the Roma is concerned, an extremely successful scientific
- 48 -

project for the codification of and preparation of teaching materials for the
Romany language is receiving promotional funding.

II.7. Transnational Exchanges (Article 7, paragraph 1(i)):
See comments regarding Article 14 describing trans-frontier exchanges for all
national minority languages.

II.8. Elimination of Discrimination (Article 7, paragraph 2):
Article 7 (1) of the Federal Constitution Act
Article 7 (1) of the Federal Constitution, which is the most important provision
stipulating general equality, must be observed in the first place. It is binding on
the legislator and the executive branch of government and one of the pillars of
Austria’s constitutional system. It stipulates that all citizens are equal before the
law. A distinction between the majority and minority population is therefore not
admissible unless there is a factual justification.
Article 14 European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms
Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms (ECHR) is an analogous provision which stipulates that enjoyment of
the rights set forth in the Convention has to be secured without discrimination on
any ground – amongst others belonging to a national minority.
Article 1 (1) of the Constitutional Law Implementing the International
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination
The Federal Constitutional Law Implementing the International Convention on the
Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, Federal Law Gazette No.
152/1955, prohibits any distinction for the sole reason of race, color, origin or
national or ethnic origin.

- 49 -

Articles 66 and 67 of the State Treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye
In addition, there are other provisions under constitutional law protecting the
members of the national minorities and stipulating that they be treated equally as
other citizens. They can be seen as a specific codification of the principle of
equality. One should mention here the provisions contained in the State Treaty of
St. Germain-en-Laye, Federal Law Gazette No. 303/1920. Article 66 (1) of the
Treaty, which has constitutional ranking, stipulates that all Austrian nationals are
equal before the law without distinction as to race, language or religion and enjoy
the same political and civic rights. According to Article 67 of that Treaty Austrian
nationals who belong to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities enjoy the same
treatment and guarantees – in law and in fact – as all other Austrian nationals.
Article 7, item 1 (State Treaty of Vienna)
Article 7, item 1, of the State Treaty Reconstituting an Independent and
Democratic Austria (State Treaty of Vienna) stipulates that Austrian nationals
belonging to the Slovene and Croatian minorities shall have the same rights as all
other Austrian nationals on the basis of the same conditions.
Anti-Discrimination Directives and EU Equal Treatment Directive
The transposition of the anti-discrimination directives and the amended EU equaltreatment directive were transposed in Austria mainly by the Equal Treatment Act,
Federal Law Gazette I No. 66/2004, and the Federal Law on the Equal Treatment
Commission and the Equal-Treatment Ombudsperson, Federal Law Gazette No.
108/1979, as last amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 66/2004. As part of the
package of accompanying measures, the competencies of the equal-treatment
ombudsperson were enlarged to create an independent “ombudsperson service”.
With 1 July 2004 as the effective date, new provisions were enacted in Austria
regarding legislation on equal treatment. The new legislation on equal treatment
serves mainly to transpose the two anti-discrimination directives, adopted by the EU,
namely
-

Council Directive 2000/43/EC on implementing the principle of equal treatment
between persons, irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Anti-Racism Directive),

-

Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal
treatment in employment and occupation (equal-treatment framework directive),
- 50 -

which prohibits any discrimination on the basis of religion or ideology, a
handicap, age or sexual orientation,
-

Directive 2002/73 of the European Parliament and Council (amended EqualTreatment Directive).

In addition to the fields of occupation and employment, the Anti-Racism Directive also
covers the areas of social protection, social benefits, education, as well as access to
and provision with goods and services; the Equal-Treatment Framework Directive and
the amended Equal-Treatment Directive only cover the areas of employment and
occupation. All directives apply both to the private and public sector.
In the course of transposing these directives, the earlier equal-treatment law was renamed and called Federal Law on the Equal-Treatment Commission and the EqualTreatment Ombudsperson Service. It was also amended to the extent that it now
governs

institutions

(Equal-Treatment

Commission

and

Equal-Treatment

Ombudsperson Service), as well as procedure. The new equal-treatment law has
taken over the substantive provisions of the earlier equal-treatment law and was
expanded by those provisions that resulted from the need to transpose the directives.
Aspects regarding handicaps, as well as matters falling under the legislative
competencies of the federal provinces are not included in the law. The service
regulations of federal civil servants are treated separately, as will be explained later.
The law contains the following main provisions: Nobody must be exposed to any direct
or indirect discrimination on grounds of gender, affiliation with an ethnic group, religion
or ideology, age or sexual orientation, in connection with an employment relationship,
especially when commencing an employment relationship, when determining the
remuneration, when granting voluntary social benefits that do not constitute a
remuneration, in connection with initial and continuing training and re-training
measures, in connection with an occupational advancement, especially promotions to
senior positions, or other working conditions, upon termination of an employment
relationship, as well in all other aspects of the working environment, such as access to
vocational guidance, occupational training, occupational continuing training and retraining outside of an employment relationship, when participating in an organization
representing employees or employers, or in connection with conditions applying to
access to self-employed gainful activities. In addition, nobody – for reasons of
- 51 -

belonging to an ethnic group – shall be exposed to direct or indirect discrimination in
any other area, namely social protection, including social security and health services,
social benefits, in education, concerning access to and supply with goods and services
that are generally available to the public, including housing facilities.
Furthermore, new stipulations were adopted in connection with the payment of
damages in case of violations of the title to equal treatment: The title to equal
treatment imposes the following sanctions on all facts constituting an act of
discrimination, which also includes discrimination for reasons of belonging to an ethnic
group:
-

compensation of the pecuniary damage, i.e. positive damage and lost earnings,
or

-

creation of non-discriminatory conditions and – in both cases – in addition

-

compensation for the intangible damage caused by the personal impairment
suffered.

In addition to the ban on sexual harassment, already included in the earlier equaltreatment law, a gender-related molestation, as well as a harassment based on one of
the facts constituting an act of discrimination is now also regarded as discrimination.
Moreover, the title to non-discriminatory criteria in job offers, including sanctions, has
now also been introduced into the new facts constituting an act of discrimination. A ban
on any disadvantageous treatment has been introduced as a measure to strengthen
the protection against discrimination. It does not only cover the complaining staff
member but also other employees such as witnesses or colleagues who support the
complaint.
The scope of tasks of the existing Equal-Treatment Commission that was previously
responsible for the equal treatment of the sexes was expanded to include the
aforementioned facts which constitute an act of discrimination. It now consists of three
senates. The scope of activities of the Equal-Treatment Ombudsperson Service, which
is responsible for providing advice and support to persons feeling exposed to acts of
discrimination, was expanded in analogy.
The federal law on equal treatment must also be observed in connection with
employees of the federal authorities. With regard to employees of the federal
- 52 -

provinces, the municipalities and the associations of municipalities, separate laws have
been adopted by the individual federal provinces which transpose the antidiscrimination directive.
Case Law of the Constitutional Court:
The general principle of equality, which was mentioned in the introduction, does not
prevent the legislator from giving preference to members of a national minority over
members of the majority population. According to the case law of the Constitutional
Court, the principle of quality requires the legislator to apply the same legal
consequences to the same facts, and different legal consequences to different facts
(objectivity rule). Especially in connection with the protection of minorities, the
Constitutional Court has held (decision of the Constitutional Court of 5 October 1981;
file number VfSlg. 9224/1981) that the various provisions of constitutional standing
relating to national minorities in their entirety imply an evaluation by the constitutional
legislator in favor of protecting the minorities. The (simple) legislator must take this
evaluation into account when adopting rules and regulations. Putting members of
national minorities on an equal footing with members of other social groups, by relying
more or less on a specific pattern, will not always satisfy the requirements of such a
constitutional evaluation. Depending on the issue to be determined, the protection of
members of a minority vis-à-vis members of other social groups may – from an
objective point of view – justify or even require a more favorable treatment of that
minority in certain cases.
Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution Act:
This is also the aim of the above-mentioned basic policy clause in Article 8 (2) of the
Federal Constitution Act. It contains a mandate for the state organs, when developing
legislation, requiring them to act in accordance with this provision. The Constitutional
Court also considers such basic policy clauses in the Constitution to be a useful tool
for any legal interpretation, as they provide regulations, which serve that aim, with an
objective justification.
Article 8 (2) of the Federal Constitution Act reads as follows:
"The Republic (federal, regional and local authorities) is committed to its
linguistic and cultural diversity, which has evolved in the course of time
and finds its expression in the autochthonous ethnic groups. The
language and culture, the continued existence and protection of these
- 53 -

ethnic groups are to be respected, safeguarded and promoted."
Code of Ethics for Austria’s Press
According to Item 5.5 of the Code of Ethics of the Austrian Press Media, any
discrimination for racial, religious, national, sexual and other reasons is inadmissible.
This Code of Ethics is a set of principles when working in the publishing business that
the Austrian media workers have imposed upon themselves.
Article IX (1), item 3, of the Introductory Law to the Laws on Administrative
Procedure
One should also mention Article IX (1), item 3, of the 1991 Introductory Law to the
Laws on Administrative Procedure, Federal Law Gazette No. 50/1991, which stipulates
that it is a punishable act under administrative law to discriminate against persons
without justification, solely on the ground of their national or ethnic origin, or to prevent
them from entering places or from resorting to services intended for general public use.

II.9. Promotion of the Understanding between all Linguistic Groups
of the Country (Article 7, paragraph 3):
Measures to promote the respect, understanding and tolerance of the entire
population for all groups living in Austria, their languages and cultures are key
objectives, particularly of political education and school education. Political
education, school education and preventive measures of information aim at
emphasizing democratic values and creating a mental climate for a co-existence
founded on respect, tolerance and non-violence within our social order. In this
context, one should mention, by way of example, the 1996-1999 research
program of the Federal Ministry for Science and Transport “Xenophobia
(Research – Reasons – Counter-Strategies)”, which had a sustained effect and
provided special support for research work on these issues.

II.10. Taking into Consideration the Needs Expressed and the
Establishment of Specific Bodies (Article 7, paragraph 4):
Austria interprets the obligation arising from the first sentence as meaning above
all that the needs and wishes expressed by the advisory councils for the national
- 54 -

minorities must be taken into consideration. The “Memorandum submitted by
Austria’s national minorities to the Austrian Federal Government and the Nation
Council”, presented on 24 June 1997 to the Federal Government and the
National Council, which the advisory councils of the national minorities had
prepared and agreed upon jointly, serves the purpose of orientation. Bearing in
mind the difficulties mentioned – particularly if there are opposing interests – this
does not preclude the possibility of taking into account the demands of other
organizations of the national minorities (especially associations), to the extent
possible.
Austria considers the above-mentioned advisory councils for the national
minorities to be the bodies in accordance with the second sentence of this
paragraph. As described above, their task – defined in Article 3 of the National
Minorities Act – is to advise the Federal Government and the Federal Ministers;
whenever so requested, they will also advise the governments of the federal
provinces.

II.11. Non-Territorial Languages (Article 7, paragraph 5):
As described above, this provision is of little practical relevance to the Republic of
Austria.

- 55 -

III. PART THREE:
III.1. Burgenland-Croatian in the Burgenland-Croatian Language
Region of the Federal Province of Burgenland:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1
Letter a ii:
In its § 2a, the 1995 Burgenland Nursery Schools Act stipulates in detail which nursery
schools in Burgenland must also offer Croatian in addition to the German language. At
present, 29 bilingual nursery schools (Croatian, German) have been established. The
government of the federal province provides assistant nursery-school teachers for
those nursery schools that do not employ nursery-school teachers trained in the two
languages.
In nursery schools that need not be run in two languages, the parents (as a minimum
25%) may apply for the assignment of an assistant nursery-school teacher for the
language of the Croatian national minority.
With the amendment of the Burgenland Nursery Schools Act of 8 July 2005, the use of
the national-minority language was expanded from a minimum of nine to twelve hours
per week in the bilingual nursery schools. Parents, who do not want their children to be
looked after in two languages, can sign off their children accordingly.
The Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy at Oberwart offers training
in the Croatian language and in bilingual didactics.
Letter b ii:
The Burgenland Minorities’ School Act translates into concrete terms the entitlement of
the Burgenland-Croatian group, under international and constitutional law, to obtain a
school education in the mother tongue. It can be said, in general, that parents in
Burgenland increasingly avail themselves of the possibility of a bilingual education for

- 56 -

their children. This applies to children from the national minorities and to children of the
majority population.
The law provides the possibility that in the primary schools of the autochthonous
settlement area, Croatian may be used as the only language of instruction; a minimum
of six hours per week of German classes is required, though. In practice, however, the
national minority does not make use of this option available to minority schools.
Primary schools in the autochthonous settlement area are, as a rule, run as bilingual
schools on a mandatory basis. As the children entering school have a highly
inconsistent level of language proficiency, the level of bilingualism is rather variable,
but becomes roughly balanced in the fourth school year. Parents who do not wish to
have their children taught in two languages have the right to sign off their children from
enrollment in a particular course, although they continue to be part of the same class.
In case of a sustained demand outside the autochthonous settlement area it is also
possible to establish bilingual schools or to offer classes in Croatian to classes or
groups of pupils, provided that a minimum of seven pupils registers for such a class.
To facilitate bilingual teaching, the maximum number of pupils per class has now been
fixed to be 18, while the minimum number is seven pupils per class. Upon request,
parents and/or guardians of pupils may ask for the school certificates to be issued in
the minority language at bilingual primary schools and/or bilingual primary-school
classes. This means that the certificate forms are bilingual and that the school
certificate is also issued additionally in the language of the national minority.

2007/2008 school year:

The Minorities’ School Act for Burgenland stipulates that the Burgenland-Croatian
language is taught at lower-level secondary schools, at a separate general upper-level
secondary school and, in addition, in the form of so-called “special language-skills
courses” also at other schools in Burgenland, in other words at state-run schools in
Burgenland in general. The comments under letter b ii apply as requirements for
setting up bilingual lower-level secondary schools. In contrast to primary schools,
pupils at lower-level secondary schools must sign up, i.e. pupils wishing to be taught
Croatian must sign up for this instruction. According to § 12 of the Minorities’ School
Act for Burgenland, there shall be one bilingual general upper-level secondary school.
This school is located at Oberwart.

Letter e iii:
The study course on international business relations at the University for Applied
Science in Eisenstadt requires that students study one Eastern-European language on
a mandatory basis. Next to Hungarian, Czech, Russian and Slovak, Croatian is one of
the languages.
On account of the universities’ autonomy, which is defined by law, any state
intervention with the study courses taught at universities is only possible to a limited
extent. In fact, Croatian is also offered as a study course at Austrian universities.
Letter f iii:
The Croatian language is taught at various adult-education colleges; it is also offered
by organizations of the national minority. The courses are also supported with funding
from the federal budget for promotional the national minorities.
As a matter of principle, there is no difference in the level of education of the Croatian
population to the rest of the population. However, on account of the age structure,
there are statistical differences. The Croatian national minority has an above-average
percentage of persons beyond the age of 60.

- 62 -

Letter g:
In Austria, this requirement is met, in particular, by the curricula which take account of
history and culture. Moreover, the subject “mother-tongue education” includes, inter
alia, facts and figures about the country of origin of the respective pupils. The goal of
mother-tongue education is to foster and to develop bi-cultural knowledge and to
develop and reinforce bilingualism. A key objective is to support the pupils involved in
developing their personality and identity.
The concept of integration is not only a fundamental principle of Austria’s general
education policy but also the basis for bilingual education and training in the bilingual
schools of our country. Primary schools in Austria – not only those within the scope of
application of the minorities’ school laws – offer inter-cultural learning as a general
educational goal. The primary school curriculum reads as follows:

"A special social and educational task accrues to primary schools
whenever they can facilitate inter-cultural learning because children with
German and non-German mother tongues are taught together. The
aspects of inter-cultural learning, with special emphasis on the cultural
heritage of the respective national minority, are most likely to be
developed in those federal provinces of Austria where children
belonging to a national minority and/or Austrian and foreign children
are taught together. In the course of dealing with the respectively other
cultural heritage such aspects as lifestyle habits, language, customs,
texts (for example stories, tales and legends), traditions, songs, etc.,
must be dealt with, in particular. Inter-cultural learning is not restricted to
learning about other cultures. Rather, the issue is to learn and to
understand together, to experience and help shape cultural values. What
is also required is to arouse interest in and curiosity for the cultural
differences, so that not only cultural unity but also cultural diversity can
be experienced as something valuable. In this connection, inter-cultural
learning is meant to contribute towards a better mutual understanding
and/or to better mutual appreciation, to help pupils realize what they have
in common, so that they can overcome prejudices. One must ensure the
linkages to the didactic principle of social learning and the educational
principle of political education, including education for peace.”
Letter h:
§ 13 of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland, Federal Law Gazette No.
641/1994 in the version of Federal Law Gazette I No. 136/1998, stipulates

institutes in order to train the nursery-school and school teachers, who are
to make sure that the requirements for bilingual instruction at schools and

nursery schools can be met. The training of teachers for language
instruction and at the bilingual instruction in Croatian and Hungarian is
offered at the Pedagogical University in Eisenstadt. The Pedagogical
University is the successor facility to the Pedagogical Academy Burgenland.
It began operating on 1 October 2007. At the Pedagogical University in
Eisenstadt both teachers for bilingual primary schools and lower-level
secondary schools (German and Croatian, as well as German and
Hungarian) are trained. The “Project-Oriented Center of Competence for
Applied Research Development” set itself three priorities. One priority, i.e.
Multi-Lingualism and Inter-Cultural Education, will especially highlight this
area, both with regard to training and research.
Croatian-speaking students of the Pedagogical University are offered the
possibility of spending a semester abroad in Croatia. Moreover, the
teachers of general upper-level secondary schools and vocational middlelevel and higher-level secondary schools also have the possibility during the
summer vacation to continue their training in Croatia. Every year, two to
three persons enroll in these courses.
Every year, one to two persons from Croatia are available for one school
year each as native speakers at the general upper-level secondary schools.
During the 2003/2004 school year (11 participants), the 2004/2005 school
year (23 participants), the 2005/2006 school year (19 participants) and the
2006/2007 school year (32 participants) summer language courses for
teachers of and other persons interested in the Burgenland-Croatian
language took place in Croatia. Guest lectures are given by bilingual
teachers in Croatia. The regional school inspectorate for Burgenland
organized the events. The Federal Pedagogical Institute in Burgenland and
the Adult-Education College of the Burgenland-Croats paid the costs of the
speakers. One should also mention the EU Comenius project “Promoting
minority languages in multi-language regions during teacher training”.
Letter i:
According to § 15 of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland, the regional
school inspectorate for Burgenland has been given a separate department
- 64 -

for the minority schools. Special inspectors have been appointed for
inspecting bilingual schools, who are qualified to teach in German and
Croatian and/or Hungarian, unless the district or regional school inspectors
have the respective language skill (see § 16 of the Minorities’ Schools Act
for Burgenland). In this specific case, the regional school inspector for the
minorities’ school system also supervises the Croatian schools.
A special service offered by the regional school inspectorate for Burgenland
is the electronic platform “Education Server Burgenland”. At the address
www.bildungsserver.com the latest news on pedagogical subjects and
about the national minorities can be found, inter alia. Moreover, a list of all
bilingual schools and specific teaching materials for teaching Croatian can
be downloaded. “ARGE Bildungsserver

Kroatisch” (Working Group

Education Server Croatian” also uses the possibility of the web organizer for
communication purposes.
Paragraph 2:
The minorities’ school system is integrated into state-run educational
system for all of Austria. There are separate curricula for instruction in the
respective minority language, which differ from the curricula of other schools
essentially only with regard to language.
§ 6 (3) and § 10 (3) Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland provide that, if
necessary, bilingual education must also be offered in Burgenland outside
of the autochthonous settlement area of the national minority.
Article 9 (Judicial Authorities):
Paragraph 1:
Letter an ii:
According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Croatian as an Official Language, Federal Law Gazette No.
231/1990 in the version of Federal Law Gazette 6/1991, the Croatian language has
been admitted as an official language, in addition to the German language, before the
local courts of Eisenstadt, Güssing, Mattersburg, Neusiedl am See, Oberpullendorf
- 65 -

and Oberwart, as well as before the Regional Court Eisenstadt. Austrian nationals, as
well as citizens from other EU States can therefore apply that they may use Croatian
as an official language in penal proceedings conducted against them before these
courts. If the provisions on official languages are violated, the title to be heard in court
is regarded as having been violated. The sanction pursuant to § 17 (2) of the National
Minorities Act for violations of the provisions on official languages at trials in criminal
proceedings is nullity of the court decision:
“Whenever the trial in criminal court proceedings has not also been
conducted in the language of the national minority, contrary to § 15, this
constitutes nullity, as defined in § 281 (1) item 3 of the 1975 Code of
Criminal Procedure. This reason for nullity cannot be claimed to the
detriment of the person who filed the application pursuant to § 15 (2) (to
use the language of the national minority), but to his advantage,
irrespective as to whether the violation of form could have an influence on
the decision …”
Letter a iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision, according to which documents or other
pieces of evidence in criminal proceedings may only be submitted in a specific
language. The court shall translate or have translated, without delay, oral and written
submissions in the Croatian language.
Letter a ii and letter a iii:
The costs and fees for translations which a court produces or has produced, shall be
borne ex officio. When assessing the amount of lump-sum costs of criminal
proceedings, the costs of an interpreter, called in pursuant to the provisions of the
National Minorities Act shall not be taken into account (§ 22 (1) of the National
Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 381 (1) item 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
If a party (person concerned) in criminal court proceedings is represented or defended
by an attorney-at-law or a penal-law counsel, the Federal State pays the fee of that
attorney-at-law or penal-law counsel for the last third of such proceedings which are
also conducted in the Croatian language.
Letter b ii:
On the basis of the same provisions as mentioned in letter a, a party may use Croatian
in civil proceedings as an official language before the same courts. A person who
intends to use Croatian, as the official language, in an oral hearing shall inform the
court to this effect without delay upon being served the summons. If a person is found
- 66 -

guilty of failing to provide this information in time, that person may be required to pay
for the additional costs incurred in this case. This obligation to provide information
does not apply to proceedings that are conducted on the basis of a submission
prepared in Croatian. The information by the party on the use of the Croatian language
applies for the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is revoked. If the
German or Croatian language is not used, or if the use of the Croatian language is not
admitted – contrary to the provisions on official language (§ 13 and following of the
National Minorities Act), the title of the party to be heard by court, to whose detriment
the violation has occurred, is deemed to have been violated in the respective step in
the proceedings.
Letter b iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision which stipulates that documents or other
pieces of evidence in civil proceedings may only be submitted in a specific language.
The court must cover the costs of translation ex officio, which the court has to produce
or to obtain pursuant to the provisions on official language (§ 13 and following of the
National Minorities Act).
In 2004, the Local Court Oberwart employed one senior court clerk, and the Regional
Court Eisenstadt employed four persons, including two judges, who were fluent in the
Croatian language.
Letter c ii:
Pursuant to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 4 of
the Ordinance on the Use of Croatian an Official Language, Croatian is admitted as an
additional official language before the Independent Administrative Senate for
Burgenland (an administrative authority according to Austrian law, but a tribunal as
defined in Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention). The details of its provisions
correlate in essence with the comments made above. § 17 (3) of the National
Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 68 (4), item 4, of the General Administrative
Proceedings Act sanctions violations of § 15 of the National Minorities Act, which
governs the use of the Croatian language in proceedings, by rendering the Senate’s
decision null and void.

- 67 -

Letter c iii:
Austrian legislation on administrative proceedings, too, which applies to proceedings
before Independent Administrative Senates, does not contain any obligation to submit
pieces of evidence only in a specific language.
Letter d:
§ 22 of the National Minorities Act makes sure that a party does not incur any
additional costs when resorting to the use of the Croatian language as an official
language. § 22 of the cited law reads as follows:

§ 22. (1) Costs and fees for translations which an authority or service unit
must produce or obtain pursuant to the present federal law shall be
covered ex officio. When assessing the lump-sum contribution to costs
pursuant to § 381 (1) item 1 of the 1975 Code of Criminal Procedure, the
costs of an interpreter/translator, recruited in accordance with the present
federal law, shall not be taken into account.
(2) (Constitutional provision) If the proceedings were also conducted in
the language of a national minority, only two thirds of the actually
required time input (for the length of a hearing) shall be used as a basis
when assessing the fees that a territorial corporation shall receive and
that are calculated according to the time input.
(3) If – on account of the present federal law – a paper must be produced
directly in two official languages, the stamp fee shall be due for only one
of the copies.
(4) If a party in court proceedings (a party involved) is represented or
defended by a legal counsel, a criminal-law counsel or a notary public,
the Federal State shall pay for the last third of the fee of such legal
counsel- criminal-law counsel or notary public, incurred in such
proceedings (hearings) that are also conducted in the language of a
national minority. Payment of that amount of the fee shall be claimed
always before the end of such a hearing or such proceedings by
submitting a statement of costs, with the loss of this claim being forfeited
otherwise; the judge shall decide on the amount of the fee immediately
and instruct the accounting officer to pay this amount to the legal
counsel- criminal-law counsel or notary public. This additional fee
expense shall be assessed in such a way as though the opponent of the
person entitled to this claim were obliged by law to refund these costs to
that party.
Paragraph 2:
Letter a:
As was mentioned before, the validity of a legal document does not depend on the
language in which it is drawn up.
- 68 -

Article 10 (Administrative authorities and public services):
Paragraph 1
Letter a iii and letter c:
§ 3 of the Ordinance on the Use of Croatian as an Official Language also mentions six
district administrative authorities, i.e. Eisenstadt-Environs, Güssing, Mattersburg,
Neusiedl am See, Oberpullendorf and Oberwart, in addition to six local courts, before
which Croatian is admitted as an official language. § 4 (1) of the cited law also
stipulates as general facts of a case that Croatian shall also be admitted as an official
language before the other authorities and service units of the Federal State and the
provincial government with offices in Burgenland, the geographical competences of
which coincide in full or in part with the geographical competences of the
aforementioned district administrative authorities and/or local courts, if Croatian were
admitted as an official language in a case in which one of the district administrative
authorities or local courts had subject-matter competences in the case in question, or if
the authority has competences as a legal-remedy instance in proceedings that were
conducted before an authority on a first-instance basis, where Croatian is admitted as
an official language in addition to the German language. Croatian as an official
language shall also be used at police stations that have geographical competences
that coincide in full or in part with the municipalities listed in § 2 of the cited law
(altogether 24). By way of exemption, Croatian is also admitted as an official language
before authorities with offices outside of Burgenland, i.e. before federal authorities with
offices in Vienna, provided that their geographical competences coincide in full or in
part with those of one of the aforementioned local courts or district administrative
authorities, but that do not cover the national territory as a whole; also before the
Calibration Office Graz whenever the Calibration Office performs official acts in the
domain of the district administrative authority of Güssing (§ 6 of the Ordinance on the
Use of Croatian as an Official language). Croatian is admitted as an official language,
in addition to the German language, before the Military Command Burgenland and
before the Vienna Recruitment Unit or the Styrian Recruitment Unit, if the former uses
the latter for its operations, whenever the matters relate to supplementary military
issues.
According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Croatian as an Official Language, an Austrian national (as
- 69 -

well as nationals of another EU State) may inform the aforementioned authorities that
he/she wishes to use to the language of the national minority. No separate information
to this effect is required whenever the proceedings are conducted on the basis of a
submission drawn up in the language of the national minority. The information applies
for the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is revoked. In particular, the
right to use the language of the national minority comprises the right to submit written
or oral submissions, as well as the right to be served decisions by or orders of the
authority concerned in the German and Croatian languages.
Time and again, the Working Group of Croatian Municipal Politicians in Burgenland
and the Presidium of MP’s of Austria’s Socialist Party both organize continuing training
events for the specific national minority for municipal officers and municipal politicians
in order to prepare them, inter alia, for the use of Croatian as an official language.
Paragraph 2
Letter b:
Please refer to the information in connection with the preceding paragraph. The
municipal authorities of the 24 municipalities listed in § 2 of the Ordinance on the Use
of Croatian as an Official Language, as well as those six district administrative
authorities, in which these municipalities are located, especially qualify as local or
regional authorities, as defined in the provisions of the Charter. These are EisenstadtEnvirons, Güssing, Mattersburg, Neusiedl am See, Oberpullendorf and Oberwart.
Croatian is also admitted as an official language before the Office of the Burgenland
Provincial Government. The right to use Croatian as a language of a national minority
especially comprises the right to submit written and oral applications in this language.
Letter d:
Moreover, § 13 (4) of the National Minorities Act empowers the municipalities listed in
the ordinance on the Use of Croatian as an Official Language to use the language of
the national minority also for general public announcements.
Paragraph 4
Letter a:
Written and oral applications in Croatian, submitted in proceedings before the
aforementioned administrative authorities conducted in Croatian as the official
- 70 -

language shall be translated into German ex officio (§ 14 of the National Minorities
Act). Pursuant to § 15 of the cited law, an interpreter shall be called in, if necessary, for
oral hearings. If minutes of these proceedings are prepared in German, they shall be
translated into Croatian without any delay. The costs incurred by such translation or
interpreting assignments shall be covered ex officio, pursuant to § 22 of the cited law.
Paragraph 5:
According to § 21 of the Civil Status Act, in conjunction with § 154 of the Austrian Civil
Law Code, a child is generally given his or her first name by the parents. There is no
requirement under Austrian law that the name must be in German, nor does the
surname have to be in German. This also derives from § 5 (3) of the Civil Status
Ordinance, according to which a person's names, which are to be registered on the
basis of a document presented in Latin letters, must be recorded in the original letters
and characters. This means that diacritic characters not used in the German language
must also be used. However, the civil-status registers must be kept in the German
language (§ 18 of the national Minorities Act). Whenever documents are submitted for
registration in the civil-status registers that are in a language of a national minority, the
authority shall have them translated. Inversely, excerpts from the civil-status registers
shall be issued as translations into the language of the respective national minority, if
so requested (§ 20 of the National Minorities Act). In keeping with the case law of the
Constitutional Court (Constitutional Court decision of 5 March 1996, file number VfSlg.
No. 14.452/1996), the foregoing shall also apply if it was not possible to conduct the
procedure resulting in the register entry (e.g. marriage ceremony) in the language of
the national minority, in the absence of an application to this effect by the member of
the national minority.
An amendment of the Names Modification Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 25/1995)
resulted in a large measure of liberalization concerning the possibility to modify one’s
name. The members of a national minority, who already have a name, converted into
German, have the possibility to assume once again their original name in the language
of the national minority. Under the amended legislation, one may modify one’s name
for any random reason. However, an important reason is required if this change of
name is to be carried out free of charge. A member of a national minority may use the
important reason pursuant to § 2 (1) item 10 of the Names Modification Act, which
states that the intended change of name is necessary in order to avoid unreasonable
- 71 -

disadvantages in his/her social relations and that these drawbacks cannot be avoided
in any other way. According to § 2 (2) of the Names Modification Act, this reason also
applies to a change of the first name.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1
Letter b ii and letter c ii:
Amendments of the federal law on Austria’s broadcasting corporation (ORF Act)
entered into force on 1 January 2002. Pursuant to § 5 (1) of the ORF Act, the Austrian
Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) is now required to broadcast a commensurate portion
of its programs in the languages of the national minorities for which advisory boards
have been set up. The broadcasting times shall be laid down on an annual basis, after
hearing the Audience’s Council. Moreover, pursuant to § 28 (4) of the ORF Act a seat
in the Audience’s Council of the ORF is reserved to a member of the national
minorities. According to § 30 (1) of the ORF Act, the Audience’s Council proposes
measures, inter alia, to comply with this statutory obligation and comments on the
program portions for national minorities which are to be counted as broadcasting
times. The amendment of the ORF Act also facilitated the cooperation between the
ORF and private radio stations. It also improved the programs offered in favor of the
languages of the national minorities.
The national minorities in Burgenland hold a special position in the program design of
the regional station (Radio Burgenland). The cultural and linguistic diversity in
Burgenland is therefore also taken into account when designing the program.
Every day and/or week, the regional broadcasting station (Landesstudio Burgenland)
broadcasts the following radio programs in the Burgenland-Croatian language:

political events, cultural and sports events, to programs for children and juveniles.
However, topics relating to the national minorities are also presented in detail on the
German-language radio and television programs of the Burgenland regional
broadcasting studio. Special attention is also paid to the national minorities in
Burgenland in the special television programs from Burgenland.

Moreover, all programs for the national minorities broadcast by Radio Burgenland can
also be received throughout Austria in digital format, as well as via Live-Stream on the
Internet. Radio 1476 is also offered as Live-Stream on the Internet. In addition, the
television programs for the national minorities of the Burgenland regional broadcasting
studio are also available for downloading from the Internet as Real-Audio and/or RealVideo.
Letter d:
CDs and inter-active CD-ROMs, for example, for language courses in the languages of
the national minorities, as well video works and theater productions are promoted
under the federal promotional activities.
Letter e:
With regard to press-promotion activities, one should mention § 2 (2) of the 2004 Press
Promotion Act, Federal Law Gazette I No. 136/2003, which provides easier access to
press-promotion funds for the media of the national minorities. While weekly
newspapers must have a minimum circulation of 5,000 copies and must have a
minimum staff of two full-time employed journalists, in order to receive promotional
funding, these requirements do not apply to weekly newspapers in a language of a
national minority.
As a matter of principle, the possibilities to publish different print media are open to all
national minorities. Funding under the promotional activities of the Federal Chancellery
for the national minorities is also available for periodicals and newsletters. The full
range covers newspapers and newsletters, scientific works on literature, monographs,
different non-fiction literature, as well as publications for children and juveniles.

- 75 -

The print media of the Burgenland-Croatian population comprises the following weekly
newspapers and periodicals:
-

Hrvatske Novine / Croatian weekly newspaper: published by the Croatian Press
Association. The newspaper is published largely in the Burgenland-Croatian
language (however, articles in the standard Croatian language are also
published on a regular basis). The reports focus on the situation and problems
of the Burgenland-Croatian population, but also deal with other national
minorities in Austria and in other countries on a regular basis.

-

Crikveni Glasnik / Croatian church newspaper: “Glasnik“ (Messenger) is
published weekly by the Diocese of Eisenstadt. “Glasnik” is the communication
and information medium of the Eisenstadt Diocese in the Croatian language.

-

Glasilo: The print medium of the association “Hrvatsko Kulturno Društvo”/
Croatian Cultural Association in Burgenland. It is published every two months.
The paper reports about events in the Croatian-language and mixed-language
villages, about concerns and problems of the national minorities in Austria and
Europe, as well as on the various activities of the cultural association.

-

Novi Glas (The New Voice): The print medium of the association
“HAK”/Croatian Club of University Graduates. It is published on a quarterly
basis. The subjects covered are the minority policy in general and that for the
Burgenland-Croatian minority in particular, Croatian literature, topics for
students and juveniles, socio-political and cultural subjects. The languages used
are Burgenland-Croatian, Croatian, German and English (occasionally). Novi
Glas regards itself as a discussion forum of the Burgenland-Croatian population.
Efforts focus on presenting topical problem areas relating to minority politics,
culture, science and language in a controversial manner.

The weekly newspapers published in the Burgenland-Croatian language are supported
both under the promotional funding activities for the national minorities and under the
general press promotion activities based on the 1985 Press Promotion Act. The
periodicals, association newsletters, etc. are also supported from funding for the
promotional activities for the national minorities, in keeping with the respective
application for promotional funding and the respective recommendation by the advisory
board of the national minority.

- 76 -

Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts and support by the
federal province of Burgenland are also available for audio-visual productions in the
Burgenland-Croatian language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs from Croatia can be received in Burgenland without any restrictions.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
In the framework of promotional activities for the national minorities, numerous cultural
facilities and activities are supported that aim at preserving the Burgenland-Croatian
language. The essential requirement for allocating promotional funding to national
minorities is that the languages of the national minorities are promoted. All types of
cultural facilities and areas of activities, as listed in Article 12 (1) of the Charter, may be
supported from the funding available for the national minorities.
In the year 2007, 37 organizations of the Burgenland-Croatian national minority,
located in Burgenland, received a total amount of EUR 955,100.00. The entities
receiving funds include twelve folklore ensembles (“Tamburicas”), three amateur
theater groups, five choirs and five other local cultural associations. These smaller
associations each received amounts between EUR 1,600.00 and EUR 2,100.00. The
associations that received larger sums of promotional funding are described in detail
below:

Burgenland-Croatian Language – The most common pitfalls and how to avoid
them)
for continuing the standardization and lexical expansion of the written BurgenlandCroatian language, as part of the “Sprachkommission” (Language Commission)

“Tamburicaorchester und Chor Güttenbach”, an association, received EUR 27,000.00
for conducting bilingual rehearsals and musical adaptations in Burgenland-Croatian for
its “Music School”.
“Bildungswerk

der

burgenländischen

Kroaten”

(Educational

Activities

of

the

Burgenland Croats) received EUR 22,500.00 for organizing language courses in
Burgenland-Croatian, for folk-dancing courses held in Burgenland-Croatian or two
languages, for organizing “zajačimo si“, folk song courses in Burgenland-Croatian,
Tamburica courses held in Burgenland-Croatian or two languages, as well as
producing the CD “Jačke za dicu - Neue Kinderlieder” (New Children’s Songs) and
publishing “Tamburica i zbor” (sheet music).
It should be pointed out, in particular, that the promotional funding for the national
minorities constitutes an essential contribution to the standardization of the
Burgenland-Croatian language, which differs from the variant spoken in Croatia. This
ongoing process of codification of new words and decisions in cases of doubt is
handled by the Scientific Institute of the Burgenland-Croats as part of the “Language
Commission” project. In 1999, the Federal Chancellery published a legal dictionary for
Burgenland-Croatian/German and German/Burgenland-Croatian (ISBN No. 3-85052021-8). These activities are a valuable tool for making it possible to use BurgenlandCroatian as a full-fledged official and teaching language.
- 81 -

In recent years, inter-active teaching programs have increasingly been produced on
CD-ROMs. In 2003, for example, “Sprachkurse für Erwachsene” (Language Courses
for Adults) were produced in the Croatian, Hungarian and Romany languages, which
were co-financed by the Federal State, the federal province and the European Union
(Copyright by “Kroatisches Kultur- und Dokumentationszentrum”). This product
received the European Seal for innovative language projects. Between 2003 and 2006,
the Croatian Cultural Association in Burgenland produced 3 CD-ROMs, with support
from the promotional funding for the national minorities, for the series “Hrvatski teško
nij!” (Burgenland-Croatian training tool for vocabulary, grammar and technical
subjects). In the year 2007, the series was continued with an inter-active CD-ROM
“Hrvatski znaš i ti”. It deals with the grammar of the Standard Croatian language and
was specifically adapted for Burgenland-Croatian students. (In the higher grades of the
upper-level secondary schools, instruction is no longer given in Burgenland-Croatian
but in Standard Croatian). One further example as to how activities for the national
minorities also try to use new technologies is the inter-active quiz in the Croatian
language (“Kvizomenija”), which was produced by the Croatian Cultural Association in
the year 2005, with support from the promotional funding activities for the national
minorities. In 2005, the Croatian Cultural and Documentation Center produced, inter
alia, a Burgenland-Croatian inter-active CD-ROM (“To kanim znati 3”), which
supplements the text book. This CD-ROM with a quiz section has been licensed for
teaching technical subjects in the Croatian language in the 4th grade of primary school
and for teaching geography in the first grade of lower-level and/or upper-level general
secondary schools. The Presidium of MPs of the Austrian Socialist Party from Croatian
and Mixed-Languages Municipalities in Burgenland has produced a complete series of
CD-ROM with bilingual portraits of bilingual municipalities in Burgenland, and it is
continuing this series.
Moreover, “Memo”, a CD, was approved for first reading instruction. At present, a CD
with exercises for teaching mathematics in the Croatian language is being produced.
(Both projects are implemented by the Croatian Cultural and Documentation Center). A
large number of the associations of the national minority already have their own web
site on the Internet.
As the promotional funding activities of the Federal Chancellery also support
infrastructure projects, especially by paying the rent for association premises and the
- 82 -

staff of larger associations, this provides the basis for further projects that are not
promoted by the Federal Chancellery. Some of the associations of the national
minorities also participate in trans-frontier projects with EU funding.
In addition to the Federal Chancellery, the federal province of Burgenland and its
municipalities also support the national minorities. Moreover, the organizations of the
national minorities are treated just like organizations of the majority population when
applying for promotional funding in the fields of education, science, the arts or sports,
for example. Under this title, the local cultural associations also receive support, time
and again, from the municipalities in which they are established – either in the form of
grants or, for example, by being allowed to use specific premises.
Paragraph 2:
The activity or the institution to be promoted does not necessarily have to be located in
the autochthonous settlement area of the national minority in order to be allocated
promotional funding. Four Burgenland-Croatian associations headquartered in Vienna,
for example, are supported with funding for the national minorities. In the year 2007,
they received a total of EUR 149,600.00. This amount was used as follows:
The “Burgenländisch-kroatische Zentrum” (Burgenland-Croatian Center) received EUR
102,500.00
-

for rent and operating costs, including the insurance for the association premises;
staff costs, office overheads
for organizing language courses for adults in Burgenland-Croatian and Standard
Croatian

The “Burgenländischkroatischer Kulturverein in Wien” (Burgenland-Croatian Cultural
Association in Vienna) received EUR 22,500.00:
-

for the bilingual children’s group “VIVERICA”
for the school section to organize Burgenland-Croatian or bilingual courses and
events with specific programs for the national minority (school and pre-school
children)
for organizing the “Kroatischen Kirtag“ (Croatian Kermis”) at “Böhmische Prater” in
Vienna with a cultural program for this specific national minority
for “OTVORENA SRCA”, the association’s own choir.

The “Kroatischer Akademikerklub” (Club of Croatian University Graduates) received
EUR 22,500.00 for:
-

the project “Dan mladine – Tage der kroatischen Jugend 2007“ (Days of Croatian
- 83 -

-

Youth 2007) with a cultural program for this specific national minority
publishing “Novi glas”, the Burgenland-Croatian or bilingual journal
for organizing “Jour fixe”, a series of discussions on specific issues of the national
minorities
organizing the project “Dan sridnioškolcev – Tage der burgenländischkroatischen
Mittelschüler in Wien” (Days of the Burgenland-Croatian High-School Students in
Vienna)

Moreover, a folklore ensemble also has its headquarters in Vienna. It received
promotional funding in the amount of EUR 2,100. These four Burgenland-Croatian
associations constitute the central meeting place for the Burgenland-Croatian
population in Vienna.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities. For
example, on 24 February 2004 the Austrian embassy and the Cultural Forum
Agram/Zagreb organized the presentation of “Grammatik der burgenländischkroatischen

Sprache”

(Grammar

of

the

Burgenland-Croatian

Language)

by

representatives of the Burgenland-Croatian population. High-level Croatian politicians
attended this book presentation. Moreover, on 27 May a round-table conference was
held on the subject of “Die Burgenländerkroaten und Kroaten: Wissenschaftliche
Tribüne – 50 Jahre im Rückblick” (Burgenland Croats and Croats: Scientific Platform –
a 50-Year Retrospective). In addition to representatives of the Burgenland-Croatian
population, Croatian scientists, representatives of the umbrella organization of
Croatian immigrants, as well of the Burgenland-Croatian community attended the
event.
The Austrian embassy and the Cultural Forum Pressburg/Bratislava reported that the
Tabmucia Jelka Perusič from Burgenland represented Austria at the 6th European
Cultural Festival of the People and Nationalities at Košice in 2005, and the Tamburica
Zagersdorf attended the 8th European Cultural Festival.
Article 13 (Economic and social life):
Paragraph 1, letter d:
This provision is implemented, first and foremost, by the ban on discriminating against
speakers of minority languages (for details see the comments on Article 7 (2)), as well
- 84 -

as by Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, which has constitutional ranking
and guarantees the right to use any language in private and business transactions. In
addition, impulses are given time and again by the promotional activities in order to
support the use of the minority languages in economic and social life. The Croatian
Cultural and Documentation Center, for example, publishes one to two BurgenlandCroatian bilingual cook books every year, with support from the promotional funding for
the national minorities. In 2004, the publication of a bible for children in the
Burgenland-Croatian language was supported. In 2003 training was provided to
conduct Burgenland-Croatian bilingual tours through the barrows at Schandorf. In 2005
a Burgenland-Croatian and/or multi-lingual hiking map was published in connection
with the Schandorf barrows. In 2004 the new publication of a prayer and song book in
Burgenland-Croatian received funding. The Adult Education College of the
Burgenland-Croats also receives funding for courses and lectures that do not
specifically deal with a topic of the national minorities but are held in the Croatian
language.
Article 14 (Trans-frontier exchanges):
Letter b:
ARGE Alpen-Adria plays a special role in maintaining trans-frontier exchanges. The
activities and stimuli from ARGE Alpen-Adria were an important contribution for
creating more awareness and giving more intensive consideration to minority issues in
Central Europe. By mutually learning about possible solutions made it possible to
contribute towards mitigating conflicts in the member regions. It is generally seen to be
a positive effect of the events organized by ARGE Alpen-Adria to date that members of
the various minorities were given an opportunity to get into direct contacts with each
other and to get to know each other in course of the cultural activities. A direct
cooperation between the regional authorities results already from the fact that the
federal province of Burgenland is a member of ARGE Alpen-Adria, and as such it is
represented by its provincial governor.
Trans-frontier contacts also exist in the form of festivals and teaching assignments for
Croatian-speaking artists in Burgenland, as well as in the form of continuing training
activities and children’s language holidays in Croatia. The primary school at CroatianMinihof and the lower-level secondary school at Rechnitz maintain school partnerships
- 85 -

with Hungary (the western part of Hungary is settled by a Burgenland-Croatian
minority). The same applies to the project “Zu zweit geht es besser! - Interkulturelle
Begegnung im neuen Europa“ (It’s easier doing it together! – Inter-cultural encounters
in the new Europe), in the course of which colleges for the applied sciences maintain
partnerships with their neighbors to the east. These three projects received the
European Seal for innovative language projects in 2007.
Moreover, the primary school at Dürnbach engages in lively exchanges with its partner
school at Fesöcsatar in Hungary. In 1988 these schools established the first
cooperation of this type in Burgenland. Since that date the partnership has been
maintained through regular activities and mutual pupils’ exchanges.
The tamburica “Ivan Vuković” maintains contacts with the Croatian towns of Senj and
Osijek, as well as the Slovak villages of Senez and Stupava (a Burgenland-Croatian
minority also resides in Slovakia). In the year 2007, “Ivan Vuković” actually won the
Tamburica competition in Osijek in the category “orchestra with more than 25
musicians”. Other Tamburica groups also represent Austria at various festivals abroad.
“KUGA Kulturna zadruga” at Großwarasdorf reported about the following trans-frontier
projects: For several years, a Hungarian course has been held in which BurgenlandCroatian serves as the language of communication. This is an experimental form of
teaching Hungarian. The course is taught by a Burgenland-Croatian teacher from
Hungary. As a result, not only Hungarian is learnt, but Burgenland-Croatian is also
applied and improved in a functional manner. Burgenland-Croatian children are also
looked after by KUGA during the holidays (KUGAforKids). Here, a BurgenlandCroatian tutor from Hungary is assigned to the task. Every year a rock-pop workshop is
being held, where 90% of the songs studied are in the Croatian language. BurgenlandCroatian is also the language of communication. Young people from Slovakia and
Hungary also participate in this workshop. One of the workshop leaders comes from
Hrvatski Jandrof in Slovakia, which is a Burgenland-Croatian village.
In the framework of a Centrope project (INTERREG IIIA), KUGA organized a concert
at Sopron three years ago, as well as one at Großwarasdorf, to which rock bands from
Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were invited. This gave
Burgenland-Croatian groups an opportunity to present themselves to audiences from
- 86 -

the neighboring countries. Numerous other rock, folklore and theater events (amateurs
and professional groups), organized by KUGA, are also attended by visitors from
across the borders.

III.2. Slovene in the Slovene Language Region of the Federal
Province of Carinthia:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1
Letter a iv:
Numerous studies and, in particular, statistical facts and practical experience in the
Carinthian educational system indicate very clearly that pre-school bilingual education
is becoming increasingly important. A growing number of children of members of the
Slovene national minority have only little, if any, knowledge of the Slovene language at
the age at which they enter school. The bilingual nursery-school system in Carinthia is
therefore of particular importance.
On 1 October 2001, the Carinthian Nursery-School Fund Act, Provincial Law Gazette
No. 74/2001, entered into force. The aim of this law is to promote private bilingual or
multi-lingual nursery schools in the settlement area of the Slovene national minority in
Carinthia. The fund was set up for the purpose of reaching this goal. Its task is to grant
financial assistance to the operators of bilingual or multi-lingual nursery schools, in
order to cover their operating losses, to advise the operators of bilingual or multilingual nursery schools on matters of language teaching in connection with educating
and caring for children, as well as to evaluate the language-teaching concepts of the
operators of bilingual or multi-lingual nursery schools. The law grants private bilingual
or multi-lingual nursery schools a legal title to financial assistance in order to cover
their operating losses, provided that they meet the necessary requirements, and does
not exclude nursery schools that may be set up in the future.
For several years, the Federal Chancellery has also been promoting a group of small
children in the bilingual settlement area, in order to also support the bilingual
pedagogical care for children below the age of three.
- 87 -

Moreover, the bilingual nursery-school groups (Slovene and German) in a total of
seven Carinthian municipal nursery schools receive funding as part of the promotional
activities of the Federal Chancellery for the national minorities. These are located at
Ludmannsdorf, Gobasnitz, St. Michael ob Bleiburg, Eisenkappel-Vellach, Sittersdorf,
Bleiburg and Feistritz im Rosental. In the year 2007, the promotional funding amounted
to a total of EUR 137,987.00.
The municipal nursery school at Ludmannsdorf should be mentioned here as a positive
example. It was awarded the European Seal for innovative language projects in
November 2007. The successful work at this nursery school proves that a living highquality bilingual education does not rule out that a further foreign language is being
acquired. In addition to the bilingual nursery-school teachers, an English teacher
(native speaker) comes to the nursery school once a week.
The responsible department in the regional Carinthian government offers continuing
training programs in the form of workshops in order to ensure the best-possible
continuing training of the bilingual nursery-school teachers.
The Working Party of Private Bilingual and Multi-Lingual Nursery Schools and the
Pedagogical Association also offer programs for the continuing training of bilingual or
multi-lingual nursery-school teachers. Projects and workshops to this effect receive
regular financial support from the funds available to the Federal Chancellery for
promoting the national minorities.
Letter b ii:
The title under international and constitutional law to school instruction of the Slovene
national minority in its mother tongue is implemented in Carinthia by the Minorities’
Schools Act for Carinthia of 1959.
In general, the provisions applicable to the organization and instruction at Austrian
primary and lower-level secondary schools are also applied to the schools (classes,
departments) within the scope of application of the Minorities’ School Act for Carinthia,
together with a few additional provisions. The latter includes the stipulation contained
in § 16 (1) of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia.
- 88 -

Bilingual education in Carinthia, the basis of which is the Minorities’ Schools Act, is
essentially supported by three pillars:

-

In general, the demand of the national minorities in Austria for education is met
by the state-run, public schools.

-

A major basic philosophy is the concept of integration which provides for the
joint teaching of different groups of pupils.

-

In Carinthia bilingual education is organized as provided by § 12 letter b of the
Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia, which reads as follows:

“Primary schools with German and Slovene as languages of instruction
(bilingual primary schools) also include – for the purposes of the present
federal law – primary schools with German as a language of instruction
that have classes taught in German and Slovene as languages of
instruction (bilingual primary-school classes) and primary-school classes
with German and Slovene as languages of instruction (bilingual primaryschool departments).”

§ 7 of the Minorities’ Schools Act defines the principle of registration, namely
registration for participation in the bilingual classes, as the expression of the parental
right, which means that registration is required:

“The right to use the Slovene language as a language of instruction or to
learn it as a compulsory subject shall be granted to every pupil in the
territories defined in accordance with § 10 (1) of the present federal law in
the schools to be determined in keeping with § 10 (1) of the present
federal law, if this is the will of the legal representative. A pupil may only
be required to use the Slovene language as a language of instruction or
to learn it as compulsory subject if this is the will of his/her legal
representative.”

With the registration of their children, the persons entitled to provide for a child’s
education state that they accept for their children the special education offered by the
Austrian school system. It is prohibited to check on whether the child belongs to the
Slovene national minority or to urge a child to express its affiliation to an ethnic group.

- 89 -

On account of various initiatives, which initially were only geared to intensify the
German-language teaching (section) at bilingual primary schools (e.g. by using
assistant teachers), there was eventually a major reform discussion, and several
commissions were set up. The main problem that was identified was that children who
had been registered for bilingual education and monolingual children were taught
together in classes and departments of bilingual primary schools. It was feared that the
monolingual pupils would be disadvantaged during the periods in which the teacher
was addressing the bilingual pupils in the Slovene language. Another problem is that
the children who are registered for bilingual education increasingly have no prior
knowledge of the Slovene language because they come from German-speaking
families or are members of the Slovene national minority, whose parents leave the
teaching of the Slovene language – for whatever reasons – to the schools.
The comprehensive preparatory work of these commissions was taken into account
when ultimately amending the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia in 1988. This
amendment improved the organizational framework conditions for bilingual primary
schools. It contains essentially the following novel features:
-

smaller numbers of pupils per class,

-

setting up parallel classes,

-

a system of having two teachers in classes with a monolingual and a bilingual
department.

Both groups of pupils, i.e. the monolingual and the bilingual one, are taught together
and encounter good conditions for their education. There are certainly pedagogical
challenges. Efforts are undertaken to cope with them by applying new forms of
teaching and by giving adequate thought to the methodology and didactics of
instruction, by teaching the language in a communicative form, as well as by designing
the teaching with comprehensive differentiation and/or individualization.
The smaller class-room units and the fact that a second teacher is assigned to classes
in which registered and non-registered pupils are taught together, ensures good
learning and teaching conditions, as well as the possibility of looking after pupils or
groups of pupils individually. The cooperative form of teaching and learning is intended
to ensure that all pupils receive optimum attention. The two teachers assigned to a
class are both responsible for all pupils, with the team teacher usually performing the
- 90 -

didactic work in German. For a time, the two-teacher system was unique in the
Austrian school system. Now, it is also applied to other areas of practical pedagogical
work, especially to heterogeneous groups, as well as to situations where integration is
an important motif. Only about 15% of the children registered for bilingual instruction
have Slovene-language skills before entering school.

Most begin by acquiring

elementary Slovene-language skills. The challenge for the teachers is that teaching is
complicated by the heterogeneous mix of the class-room population and the different
Slovene-language skills. The curricula are designed as “planning concepts which make
it possible for the teachers to choose the tasks and the content and thereby to meet
the individual needs and requirements of the children, as well as to cope with the
special circumstances.”
The locations of primary and lower-level secondary schools especially for the Slovene
population were determined for those municipalities in which there was bilingual
instruction at the beginning of the 1958/1959 school year.
In addition, additional primary schools outside this area need to be determined, where
there is a sustained need to satisfy the right under Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty
of Vienna. For these schools the school districts need to be defined in such a manner
that it covers the entire area of Carinthia, with the exception of the area described in
the previous paragraph.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of 9 March 2000, file number G 2-4/00-7:
In this decision the Constitutional Court stated that “elementary education” in the
meaning of Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna, which has constitutional
standing, refers to the first four years of school education. In these grades, instruction
must therefore be given in two languages in the schools under consideration. In its
decision the Constitutional Court explained that elementary education in the Slovene
language will not be ensured whenever Slovene – as well as other foreign languages –
is only taught as a compulsory subject, whereas all other subjects are taught only in
German. As this was the case to date in the fourth grade of primary school, the
restriction of bilingual education to the first three grades was lifted.
This decision has been fully implemented. Elementary education is now in the first four
grades of primary school.
- 91 -

Decision of the Constitutional Court of 27 June 2002, file number B 1230/01:
One should first point to the decision of the Constitutional Court of 27 June 2002, file
number B 1230/01, in which the Constitutional Court dealt with the constitutionality of
the closing down of a primary school within the scope of application of the Minorities’
Schools Act for Carinthia. In the aforementioned decision the Constitutional Court
stated, inter alia, that on account of Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna
there are no reservations under constitutional law concerning the provisions of the
Carinthian school law with regard to setting up and continuing the operation of primary
schools, their closing down or the setting up of classes as school branches
(Expositurklasse), because these arrangements did not affect § 1 (3) of the Carinthian
regional law that was enacted to implement the basic principles of the Minorities’
Schools Act for Carinthia. According to the relevant implementing provisions for
Carinthia, every pupil living on the territory of municipalities at which instruction at
primary and lower-level secondary schools was given in two languages at the
beginning of the 1958/1959 school year was entitled to being taught at a bilingual
primary and lower-level secondary school. However, with these arrangements Article
7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna has been implemented. The provision of the
State Treaty requires that – in line with the objective of Article 7 of the State Treaty of
Vienna – elementary schools for the national minority must be designated for every
municipality in the autochthonous settlement area of the Slovene minority in Carinthia,
as it derives from the Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna (see file number
VfSlg. 12.345/1989). There is also compliance with Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty
of Vienna and § 1 (3) of the aforementioned Carinthian regional law if in a municipality
(that of Zell in the case of this court decision) there is (any) one bilingual primary
school for the pupils of that school district. The further existence of an (additional)
primary school in a designated municipality (namely the primary school at Zell-Pfarre)
is therefore not required. There is even less reason for reservations whenever a class
is set up as a school branch (Expositurklasse) at the location of the former primary
school, at which elementary instruction is offered in the Slovene language. After all, the
organization of the instruction under school law does not matter in this context.
This decision has made it clear that according to Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of
Vienna there are no obstacles to closing down a bilingual primary school, at least not

in a school branch. In the meantime, the small number of pupils (less than 10 pupils
per school location) has led to the closing down of the primary schools at Ebriach,
Windisch Bleiberg and Zell-Winkel.
The decrease in birth rates in the various school districts is a matter of serious
concern. One the number of pupils registered for a school falls below a certain
number, the question is whether that operation of that school can be continued. The
regional authorities take a generous stand with regard to this problem. The regional
school council (department VII/ minorities’ schools) holds bi-annual information
meeting with the organizations representing the Slovene population in Carinthia. These
talks help both sides to cope with the imminent questions.

Within the scope of application of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia (and if there
is a sustainable demand also beyond it), the persons responsible for their children’s
education have the possibility of registering them for bilingual instruction (primary
school) and Slovene education (as of the secondary-school grade I).
Within the territorial scope of application of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia
there are 74 primary schools, of which 6 are classes at school branches (Expositur)
and 2 bilingual primary schools in Klagenfurt which were attended by a total of 4666
pupils during the 2007/2008 school year.
1892 pupils, which correspond to 40.55%, have been registered for bilingual instruction
at 64 primary schools, of which 5 are classes at school branches (Expositur). In
Klagenfurt, 187 pupils are taught in two languages at another 2 primary schools.
Letter c iii:
As a matter of principle, Slovene may also be taught at lower-level secondary schools,

C = Slovene as an optional subject
The knowledge of the Slovene language obtained while attending compulsory school
can be deepened and extended when continuing to attend general or vocational
middle-level or higher-level schools.
Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna provides for a “proportionate number of
own upper-level secondary schools” for the Slovene minority. As a result, the federal
upper-level grammar school (Bundesgymnasium) (now also an upper-level secondary
school = Bundesrealgymnasium) for the Slovene population was founded in Klagenfurt
in 1957, where classes are taught in the Slovene language. With the establishment of
the so-called Slovene Grammar School, significant educational dynamism set in within
the Slovene national minority. This was further reinforced when the University of
Klagenfurt was founded in the seventies.
Since the 1999/2000 school year the so-called “Kugy Class” was introduced at the
Slovene Grammar School, which is a unique pedagogical innovation. This is an
autonomous school project in the course of which new methods are used for multilingual instruction so that pupils and students from Carinthia, Slovenia and FriuliVenezia can attend classes. The main languages of the project are Slovene (the
common language of all children), German and Italian, as well as English.
The Federal Grammar School and the Federal Upper-Level Secondary School for
Slovenes in Klagenfurt was attended by a total of 543 pupils during the 2007/2008
school year.

As parts of the autochthonous settlement area is located on the periphery, some of the
pupils live at dormitories during the week. However, this is not a specific problem of the
national minority. Members of the majority population also have to live under similar
circumstances. However, the number of pupils living at dormitorites is on the decrease.
Letter d iv:
The legal basis for lower-level secondary schools also applies to instruction at the
polytechnic schools in Carinthia.
According to the amendment of the Minorities’ Schools Act,
“a bilingual commercial college shall be set up in Carinthia, especially for
Austrian nationals of the Slovene minority. (…) At the bilingual
commercial college, instruction in all classes shall be given equally in the
Slovene and German languages. As to the languages taught, German,
Slovene, English and another living foreign language shall be the
compulsory subjects.”

Since the 1990/1991 school year a bilingual commercial college has been operated in
Klagenfurt. In addition, the bilingual teaching institute for business occupations of the
Convent of the School Sisters (denominational private school) at St. Peter near St.
Jakob im Rosental has been established.
During the 2007/2008 school year, a total of 159 pupils attended the bilingual federal
commercial college in Klagenfurt. During the same period, a total of 128 pupils were

- 101 -

enrolled at the private bilingual higher-level teaching institute for business occupations
and the attached one-year technical school for business occupations.
596 pupils had signed up for Slovene as optional subjects or attended Slovene classes
as an optional compulsory subject at the other general and vocational upper-level
secondary schools. The current pupil numbers can be seen above in the table on
Slovene instruction at general and vocational middle-level and upper-level secondary
schools in Carinthia (letter c iii).
There is no instruction in the Slovene language and/or of the Slovene language at the
vocational schools that apprentices attend in the course of the dual vocational training.
Letter e iii:
Slovene is taught in study courses at the following Austrian universities:
-

University of Vienna, Institute for Slavic Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Slavic Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Theoretical Applied Translation Science

-

University of Innsbruck, Institute for Slavic Studies

-

University of Klagenfurt, Institute for Slavic Studies

At the Alpen-Adria University Klagenfurt it is possible to enroll in diploma courses for
Slavic studies and to attend the study course for teachers with Slovene as one of the
teaching subjects, as well as to enroll in a diploma course in applied business
management, with Slovene as a foreign language.
Letter f iii:
Slovene is taught at various adult-education colleges, and language courses are
offered by the organizations of the national minorities. The programs offered also
receive support from the federal budget for promoting the activities of the national
minorities.
Letter g:
In Austria, this provision is especially met by the curricula, which also take account of
the history and culture of the national minorities.

- 102 -

The very comprehensive and detailed ordinance of the Federal Ministry of Education,
which determines the curricula for minority primary schools and for instruction of the
minority languages in the primary schools and lower-level secondary schools of the
federal provinces of Burgenland and Carinthia (Federal Law Gazette 1966/118, as last
amended by Federal Law Gazette II 1998/309), contains the following summary
statement in connection with teaching the history and culture of members of the
national minorities:
“The aspects of inter-cultural learning, with special emphasis on the
cultural heritage of the respective national minority, are most likely to be
developed in those federal provinces of Austria where children belonging
to a national minority and/or Austrian and foreign children are taught
together. In the course of dealing with the respectively other cultural
heritage, such aspects as lifestyle habits, language, customs, texts (for
example stories, tales and legends), traditions, songs, etc., must be dealt
with, in particular. Inter-cultural learning is not restricted to learning about
other cultures. Rather, the issue is to learn together and to understand, to
experience and help shape cultural values. What is also required is to
arouse interest in and curiosity for the cultural differences, so that not
only cultural unity but also cultural diversity can be experienced as
something valuable.”
It is mentioned in this context that the curricula are of a general character, which
makes it possible to take account of novel features and changes in society, culture and
the economy and to attach the respective significance to the content of the various
curricula in keeping with the objectives of the specific school. There are teaching
principles that apply to schools in general and to different subjects, which includes the
principle of “inter-cultural learning”, thinking and acting. It is part and parcel of the
general goals of education at all Austrian schools (not only at the schools of and for the
national minorities). Occasionally, the school authorities will make suggestions, make
recommendations or provide assistance, but they will not issue binding rules. It is
largely left to the scope of autonomous action (and thus to the responsibility) of the
schools and/or the teachers to comply with the provisions on the curriculum. However,
an additional provision concerning the curriculum applies to the Grammar School and
Upper-Level Secondary School for Slovenes in Klagenfurt in connection with the
subjects of “history” and “sociology”, namely that “the Slovene history must also be
dealt with as an integral part of the curriculum on all school levels”. Two approved text
books in Slovene are available for this purpose (History of the Slovene People, 1978;
History of the Slovenes in Carinthia from the Year 1918 to Today, Including Overall
Slovene History, 1985).

Letter h:
A sound basic and continuing training for teachers is an important prerequisite if a
bilingual school system is to function and if Slovene culture and history are to be
taught. In addition to the technical qualification of teachers it is also of major
importance to have good pedagogical training. Teamwork, conflict resolution, intercultural learning, as well as handling the new communication technologies have
become more important today than ever before.
On 1 October 2007 the Pedagogical University for Carinthia was inaugurated. It is also
referred to as Viktor Frankl University. It is the successor institution to the Federal
Pedagogical Academy in Carinthia and the central institution for the basic and
continuing training of teachers. As it is the pedagogical university of the Alpen-Adria
region, it is committed to inter-cultural education on an international level. This is also
demonstrated by a center of competence for “Multi-Lingualism and Inter-cultural
Education”. The focus of education and research activities is on inter-cultural
pedagogy in the fields of language didactics/multi-lingualism, global learning and
peace pedagogy. The multi-lingualism and mobility of students and teachers finds
expression in a wide range of educational cooperation projects and is an obvious
aspect of activities. In view of the historical and cultural situation in Carinthia, the
Slovene language is of major importance in the basic and continuing training of
teachers for the minority school system.
In addition to offering general vocational qualifications for teachers at compulsory
schools, the Viktor Frankl University also offers courses to obtain the teaching
qualification for the minority school system. This means specifically that students may
also obtain training as bilingual teachers, as well as team teachers by following a
modularized curriculum. The requirement for this training is to have a sound
knowledge of the Slovene language. Language courses to obtain Slovene language
skills are offered at the Pedagogical University.
The scope of activities of the aforementioned center of competence comprises the
organization, implementation and evaluation of language teaching, continuing
language training and language research. It comprises all foreign languages taught at
schools, Slovene as a first and second language, as well as German as a second
language for pupils with a migration background. The goal is to offer a high quality of
- 104 -

training for teachers at bilingual schools, which is achieved through close practical
cooperation with experienced teachers. Contacts and joint projects with the universities
of Klagenfurt/Celovec, Ljubljana/Laibach and Koper/Capodistria support these efforts.
It is planned that, in the course of the coming years, the training of foreign-language or
second-language teachers will be put on a common basis and coordinated with regard
to curriculum, methodology and didactics, using the European reference frame for
languages. The curricula will be upgraded to the latest methodological and didactic
level, on the basis of a scientifically founded competence model. In the field of
languages, this is achieved by employing the European language portfolio and in the
methodological and didactic field by using a language didactics portfolio developed by
the Council of Europe.
During a multi-year introductory phase, the training of bilingual teaches and team
teachers will be evaluated. The goal of this measure is to ensure and to enhance both
the quality of the training and the quality of bilingual instruction and of teaching the

Letter i:
Article 7, item 2, of the State Treaty of Vienna stipulates that a department shall be set
up with the school inspectorate for the Slovene schools. According to § 31 of the
Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia, the regional school inspectorate for Carinthia
shall have a department for matters a) of the primary schools and lower-level
secondary schools with Slovene instruction, b) of Slovene-language instruction in the
bilingual primary schools and the Slovene-language departments of lower-level
secondary schools, as well as c) of the federal upper-level secondary school with
Slovene as the language of instruction and the bilingual commercial college. The
regional school inspectorate for Carinthia complied with this instruction by setting up a
separate department for the minority schools which is responsible for supervising the
schools. It publishes an annual comprehensive report on the situation of the minorityschool system in Carinthia. These annual reports are based on an internal official
evaluation and are used as a premise for quality assurance and developing the
minority-school system.
Paragraph 2:
§ 11 (1) of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Carinthia stipulates that, if there is demand,
bilingual instruction should also be offered in Carinthia outside the autochthonous
settlement area of the national minority (see letter b ii above). This means in practical
terms that if seven primary-school pupils and/or five lower-level secondary school
pupils have signed up, the demand is regarded as being sustainable.
Article 9 (Judicial Authorities):
Paragraph 1:
Letter an ii:
According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Slovene, the Slovene language has been admitted as official
language, in addition to the German language, before the local courts of Ferlach,
Eisenkappel and Bleiburg, as well as before the Regional Court Klagenfurt. Austrian
nationals, as well as citizens from other EU States can therefore apply that they may
use Slovene as the official language in penal proceedings conducted against them
before these courts. If the provisions on official languages are violated, the title to be
- 106 -

heard in court is regarded as having been violated. The sanction pursuant to § 17 (2)
of the National Minorities Act for violations of the provisions on official languages at
trials in criminal proceedings is nullity of the court decision:
“Whenever the trial in criminal court proceedings have not been
conducted in the language of the national minority, contrary to § 15, this
constitutes nullity, as defined in § 281 (1) item 3 of the 1975 Code of
Criminal Procedure. This reason for nullity cannot be claimed to the
detriment of the person who filed the application pursuant to § 15 (2) (to
use the language of he national minority), but to his advantage,
irrespective as to whether the violation of form could have had an
influence on the decision …”
Letter an iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision, according to which documents or other
pieces of evidence in criminal proceedings may only be submitted in a specific
language. The court shall translate or have translated, without delay, oral and written
submissions in the Slovene language.
Letter a ii and letter a iii:
The costs and fees for translations which a court produces or has produced, shall be
borne ex officio. When assessing the amount of lump-sum costs of criminal
proceedings, the costs of an interpreter, called in pursuant to the provisions of the
National Minorities Act shall not be taken into account (§ 22 (1) of the National
Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 381 (1) item 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
If a party (person concerned) in criminal court proceedings is represented or defended
by an attorney-at-law or a penal-law counsel, the Federal State pays the fee of that
attorney-at-law or penal-law counsel for the last third of such proceedings which are
also conducted in the Slovene language.
Letter b ii:
On the basis of the same provisions as mentioned in letter a, in civil proceedings a
party may use Slovene as an official language before the same courts. A person who
intends to us Slovene, as the official language, in an oral hearing shall inform the court
thereof without delay upon being served the summons. If a person is found guilty of
failing to provide this information in time, that person may be required to pay for the
additional costs incurred in this case. This obligation to provide information does not
apply to proceedings that are conducted on the basis of a submission prepared in
Slovene. The information by the party on the use of the Slovene language applies for
- 107 -

the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is revoked. If the German or
Slovene language is not used, or if the use of the Slovene language is not admitted –
contrary to the provisions on official language (§ 13 and following of the National
Minorities Act) – the title of the party to be heard by court is deemed to have been
violated in the respective step in the proceedings to whose detriment the violation has
occurred.
Letter b iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision which stipulates that documents or other
pieces of evidence in civil proceedings may only be submitted in a specific language.
The court must cover the costs of translation ex officio, which the court has to produce
or to obtain pursuant to the provisions on official language (§ 13 and following of the
National Minorities Act).
The Federal Ministry of Justice provided the following statistical material on the
number of persons working for the courts who have language skills in the language of
the national minority, as well as on the number of cases conducted in the Slovene
language in Carinthian courts (The figures relate to the year 2004):
The number of officials with Slovene language skills and of the court cases conducted
in Slovene as an official language:
Local Court Bleiburg: 3 persons, including the director of the local court and the head
of the court office.
Local Court Eisenkappel: 4 persons, including the director of the local court and the
head of the court office.
Local Court Ferlach: 5 persons, including the director of the local court, one further
judge and the head of the court office.
During the period under review, no proceedings before the Regional Court Klagenfurt
were conducted in the Slovene language. This correlates with the figures for the
previous years. It was only in the year 2002 that one case (criminal media law) was
conducted in the Slovene language.
- 108 -

Before the local courts of Bleiburg, Eisenkappel and Ferlach, a total of 100
proceedings were conducted in the course of which – partly completely – hearings and
examinations were conducted in the Slovene language and/or actions and
submissions were filed in the Slovene language. Moreover, advice on legal matters
was given in the Slovene language – especially on the court days of the local courts at
Eisenkappel and Ferlach.
A comparison with the figures for the year 2003 shows an increase in the number of
cases before the Local Court Bleiburg (+4), as well as the Local Court Ferlach (+10)
and a slight decrease before the Local Court Eisenkappel (-3). The total number of
cases continued to increase, as compared to the year before. The strong downward
trend of earlier years therefore appears to have been stopped (total number of cases in
2000: 158; in 2001: 83; in 2002: 69; in 2003: 89; 2004: 100).
A submission for being granted the fee according to § 22 (4) of the National Minorities
Act was filed in three cases (Local Court Eisenkappel: 2; Local Court Ferlach: 1). For
the sake of comparison the figures were 1 for Eisenkappel in 2003; 2 for Eisenkappel
in 2002; and 1 for Eisenkappel in 2001.
Letter c ii:
Pursuant to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 4 of
the Ordinance on the Use of Slovene an Official Language, Slovene is admitted as an
additional official language before the Independent Administrative Senate for Carinthia
(an administrative authority according to Austrian law, but a tribunal as defined in
Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention). The details of the provisions correlate in
essence with the comments made above. § 17 (3) of the National Minorities Act, in
conjunction with § 68 (4), item 4, of the General Administrative Proceedings Act
sanctions violations of § 15 of the National Minorities Act, which governs the use of the
Slovene language in proceedings, by rendering the Senate’s decision null and void.
Letter c iii:
Austrian legislation on administrative proceedings, too, which applies to proceedings
before Independent Administrative Senates, does not contain any obligation to submit
pieces of evidence only in a specific language.
- 109 -

Letter d:
§ 22 of the National Minorities Act makes sure that a party does not incur any
additional costs when resorting to the use of the Slovene language as an official
language. § 22 of the cited law reads as follows:
§ 22. (1) Costs and fees for translations which an authority or service unit
must produce or obtain pursuant to the present federal law shall be
covered ex officio. When assessing the lump-sum contribution to costs
pursuant to § 381 (1) item 1 of the 1975 Code of Criminal Procedure, the
costs of an interpreter/translator, recruited in accordance with the present
federal law, shall not be taken into account.
(2) (Constitutional provision) If the proceedings are also conducted in the
language of a national minority, only two thirds of the actually required
time input (for the length of a hearing) shall be used as a basis when
assessing the fees that a territorial corporation shall receive and that are
calculated according to the time input.
(3) If – on account of the present federal law – a paper must be produced
directly in two official languages, the stamp fee shall be due for only one
of the copies.
(4) If a party in court proceedings (a party involved) is represented or
defended by a legal counsel, a criminal-law counsel or a notary public,
the Federal State shall pay for the last third of the fee of such legal
counsel, criminal-law counsel or notary public, incurred in such
proceedings (hearings) that are also conducted in the language of a
national minority. Payment of that amount of the fee shall be claimed
always before the end of such a hearing or such proceedings by
submitting a statement of costs, with the loss of this claim being forfeited
otherwise; the judge shall decide on the amount of the fee immediately
and instruct the accounting officer to pay this amount to the legal counsel,
criminal-law counsel or notary public. This additional fee expense shall be
assessed in such a way as though the opponent of the person entitled to
this claim were obliged by law to refund these costs to that party.
Paragraph 2:
Letter a:
As was mentioned before, the validity of a legal document does not depend on the
language in which it is drawn up.

- 110 -

Article 10 (Administrative authorities and public services):
Paragraph 1
Letter an iii and letter c:
§ 3 of the Ordinance on the Use of Slovene as an Official Language also mentions
three district administrative authorities, i.e. Villach (environs), Klagenfurt (environs) –
with the exception of the branch office at Feldkirchen – and Völkermarkt, in addition to
three local courts, before which Slovene is admitted as an official language. § 4 (1) of
the cited law also stipulates as general facts of a case that Croatian shall also be
admitted as an official language before the other authorities and service units of the
Federal State and the provincial government with offices in Carinthia, the geographical
competences of which coincide in full or in part with the geographical competences of
the aforementioned district administrative authorities and/or local courts, if Slovene
were admitted as an official language in a case in which one of the district
administrative authorities or local courts had subject-matter competences in the case
in question, or if the authority has competences as a legal-remedy instance in
proceedings that were conducted before an authority on a first-instance basis, where
Slovene is admitted as an official language in addition to the German language.
Slovene as an official language shall also be used at police stations that have
geographical competences that coincide in full or in part with the municipalities listed in
§ 2 of the cited law. Slovene is admitted as an official language, in addition to the
German language, before the Military Command in Klagenfurt, whenever the matters
relate to supplementary military issues.
According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Slovene as an Official Language, an Austrian national (as
well as nationals of another EU State) may inform the aforementioned authorities that
he/she wishes to use to the language of the national minority. No separate information
to this effect is required whenever the proceedings are conducted on the basis of a
submission drawn up in the language of the national minority. The information applies
for the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is revoked. In particular, the
right to use the language of the national minority comprises the right to submit written
or oral submissions, as well as the right to be served decisions by or orders of the
authority concerned in the German and Slovene languages.
- 111 -

Since the decision of the Constitutional Court of 4 October 2000, file number V 91/9911, it especially applies to the political district of Völkermarkt that every authority must
take the initiative and examine whether it must use Slovene as the official language.
This is due to the fact that the State Treaty of Vienna applies directly in this case.
Paragraph 2
Letter b:
Please refer to the information in connection with the preceding paragraph. The
municipal authorities of the 12 municipalities listed in § 2 of the Ordinance on the Use
of Slovene as an Official Language, as well as additional bilingual municipalities in the
district of Völkermarkt, as well as those three district administrative authorities, in
which these municipalities are located, i.e. Villach (environs), Klagenfurt (environs) –
with the exception of the branch office at Feldkirchen – and Völkermarkt, especially
qualify as local or regional authorities, as defined in the provisions of the Charter.
Slovene is also admitted as an official language before the Office of the Carinthian
Provincial Government. The right to use Slovene as a language of a national minority
especially comprises the right to submit written and oral applications in this language.
The Office for National Minorities, set up specifically with the Office of the Carinthian
Provincial Government, has translated a number of forms into the Slovene language
(applications for passports, applications for amendments and/or modifications of
passports, applications for being issued an identity card, applications for being issued
a driving license, residence registration forms, applications for being issued a hunting
card,

etc.),

which

are

available

for

downloading

on

its

web

site

(www.volksgruppenbuero.at/services/C4), in order to enhance the functionalities of
Slovene as an official language. Moreover, the Office for National Minorities also acts
as a translation service.
Letter d:
Moreover, § 13 (4) of the National Minorities Act empowers the municipalities listed in
the ordinance on the Use of Slovene as an Official Language to use the language of
the national minority also for general public announcements.
Paragraph 4

- 112 -

Letter a:
Written and oral applications in Slovene, submitted in proceedings before the
aforementioned administrative authorities conducted in Slovene as the official
language shall be translated into German ex officio (§ 14 (1) of the National Minorities
Act). Pursuant to § 15 of the cited law, an interpreter shall be called in, if necessary, for
oral hearings. If minutes of these proceedings are prepared in German, they shall be
translated into Slovene without any delay. The costs incurred by such translation or
interpreting assignments shall be covered ex officio, pursuant to § 22 of the cited law.
Paragraph 5:
According to § 21 of the Civil Status Act, in conjunction with § 154 of the Austrian Civil
Law Code, a child is generally given his or her first name by the parents. There is no
requirement under Austrian law that the name must be in German, nor does the
surname have to be in German. This also derives from § 5 (3) of the Civil Status
Ordinance, according to which a person's names, which are to be registered on the
basis of a document presented in Latin letters, must be recorded in the original letters
and characters. This means that diacritic characters not used in the German language
must also be used. However, the civil-status registers must be kept in the German
language (§ 18 of the National Minorities Act). Whenever documents are submitted for
registration in the civil-status registers that are in a language of a national minority, the
authority shall have them translated. Inversely, excerpts from the civil-status registers
shall be issued as translations into the language of the respective national minority, if
so requested (§ 20 of the National Minorities Act). In keeping with the case law of the
Constitutional Court (Constitutional Court decision of 5 March 1996, file number VfSlg.
No. 14.452/1996), the foregoing shall also apply if it was not possible to conduct the
procedure resulting in the register entry (e.g. marriage ceremony) in the language of
the national minority, in the absence of an application to this effect by the member of
the national minority.
An amendment of the Names Modification Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 25/1995)
resulted in a large measure of liberalization concerning the possibility to modify one’s
name. The members of a national minority, who already have a name, converted into
German, have the possibility to assume once again their original name in the language
of the national minority. Under the amended legislation, one may modify one’s name
for any random reason. However, an important reason is required if this change of
- 113 -

name is to be carried out free of charge. A member of a national minority may use the
important reason pursuant to § 2 (1) item 10 of the Names Modification Act, which
states that the intended change of name is necessary in order to avoid unreasonable
disadvantages in his/her social relations and that these drawbacks cannot be avoided
in any other way. According to § 2 (2) of the Names Modification Act, this reason also
applies to a change of the first name.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1:
Letter b ii and letter c ii:
Amendments of the federal law on Austria’s broadcasting corporation (ORF Act)
entered into force on 1 January 2002. Pursuant to § 5 (1) of the ORF Act, the Austrian
Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) is now required to broadcast a commensurate portion
of its programs in the languages of the national minorities for which national-minority
advisory boards have been set up. The broadcasting times shall be laid down on an
annual basis, after hearing the Audience’s Council. Moreover, pursuant to § 28 (4) of
the ORF Act a seat in the Audience’s Council of the ORF is reserved to a member of
the national minorities. According to § 30 (1) of the ORF Act, the Audience’s Council
proposes measures, inter alia, to comply with this statutory obligation and comments
on the program portions for national minorities which are to be counted as
broadcasting times. The amendment of the ORF Act also facilitated the cooperation
between the ORF and private radio stations. It also improved with sustainability the
programs offered in favor of the languages of the national minorities.
Every day and/or week, the regional broadcasting station (Landesstudio Kärnten)
broadcasts the following radio programs in the Slovene language:

As part of the cooperation with AKO Lokalradio GmbH, the ORF has been producing
an information and entertainment program in the Slovene language since March 2004,
which is broadcast throughout the day with a total of eight hours daily broadcasting
time. It is broadcast via

"Radio DVA-AGORA" (main frequency: 105.5 MHz) at the

following time slots: 06.00 - 10.00 h, 12.00 - 13.00 h, 15.00 -18.00 h. AKO Lokalradio
GmbH is responsible for the time zones 10.00 -12.00 h, 13.00 - 15.00 h, as well as
18.00 -06.00 h, which produces the program for these time slots. In Carinthia there is
therefore a full 24-hour program for the Slovene minority.
On the ORF program platforms, the ORF news broadcast in German is taken over at
every full hour (except at 12.00 h); Slovene news are broadcast at 6.30 h, 7.30 h, 8.30
h, 9.30 h, 15.30 h and 16.30 h. Moreover, at the time slots 10.00 -12.00 h (Radio
DVA) and 13.00 -15.00 h (Radio AGORA) the ORF news are broadcast in German,
always at the full hour, and at 10.30 h and 11.30 h the news in the Slovene language
are taken over by “Radio DVA-AGORA” from the regional studio for Carinthia. As a
result, throughout the day (6.00 h to 18.00 h), uniform news coverage is ensured. The
music format comprises hits, oldies and folklore music, with the focus on Slovene
songs.

On the web site of the regional studio for Carinthia (http://kaernten.orf.at) the programs
broadcast by Radio Carinthia are available live, and the Slovenian television programs
and information programs of the ORF on “Radio DVA-AGORA” are available for
downloading at volksgruppen.orf.at.
The on-line platform of the ORF (volksgruppen.orf.at), which is being produced jointly
by the minorities’ editing desk and national minorities’ editing desks of the regional
studios for Burgenland and Carinthia, went through a re-launch at the beginning of
2006. The newly designed entry page offers an overview in several languages about
the most important news of the day. From this page, interested users can access
directly the in-depth reports, both on the Slovene-language and the German-language
pages. Events for specific target groups are listed in a clear layout on the channel
“Termine” (dates), and the content of the radio and TV programs for the national
minorities are listed on the channel “Programm” (program). The newly set-up channel
“Radio 1476“ gives an overview of the programs offered to the national minorities by
ORF-Radio 1476. There, the programs in German, Romany, Slovak, Czech and
Hungarian are also available “on demand” for downloading and can thus listened
(again) at a later date. “volksgruppen.orf.at” thus supplements the Live-Stream
programs available from Radio 1476 on the Internet. In addition to all TV programs
produced by the national minorities’ editing desks, all radio magazines can now also
be accessed on the Internet for a period of one week.
Letter d:
In the framework of federal promotional funding for the national minorities, CDs with
language courses in the languages of the national minorities, video works and theater
productions are also promoted.
Letter e i:
In connection with press promotion, reference is made to § 2 (2) of the 2004 Press
Promotion Act, Federal Law Gazette I No. 136/2003, which offers the media of the
national minorities easier access to press promotion funding. While weekly
newspapers must have a minimum circulation of 5,000 copies and must have a staff of
- 118 -

two full-time employed journalists, in order to receive promotional funding, these
requirements do not apply to the weekly newspapers of the national minorities.
„Novice“, the Carinthian weekly newspaper in the Slovene language, and “Nedelja”,
the Slovenian church bulletin of the Gurk Diocese receive support as general press
promotion funding under the 1985 Press Promotion Act. The newspaper of the Club of
Slovene Students (“PUNT!”) is promoted from publication promotion funding.

In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Slovene language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs from Slovenia can be received in Carinthia without any restrictions.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a:
Various cultural facilities and activities, which aim at preserving the Slovene language,
are being promoted in the framework of promotional funding activities for the national
minorities. All types of cultural facilities and areas of activities, as listed in Article 12 (1)
of the Charter, are eligible for promotional funding. In the year 2007, 76 organizations
of national minorities with registered offices in Carinthia, as well as facilities of the
Catholic church for the specific purposes of the national minorities received a total
amount of EUR 1,140,000.00 from the Federal Chancellery as promotional funding for
the national minorities. Moreover, the organizations of the national minorities also
- 119 -

received funding from the federal province of Carinthia and the municipalities. In
addition to this special promotional funding for specific purposes of the national
minorities, the organizations of the national minorities can also apply for promotional
funding from other areas such as, for example, education, science, the arts, etc.
The 76 organizations of the national minorities in Carinthia, which received promotional
funding for the national minorities in the year 2007, comprised 33 local cultural
associations. They received an amount between EUR 1,000.00 and EUR 6,500.00, on
average EUR 3,670.00. Especially frequent were projects to produce music CDs in the
Slovene language or in two languages, as well as fees for leaders of Slovene choirs
and for adapting pieces of music, also the production of theater or puppet theater
performances in the Slovene language or in two languages, or to organize concerts in
the Slovene language or in several languages. In addition, 8 sports clubs received
promotional funding for working with juveniles in the Slovene language, and the
Slovene Sports Association received promotional funding for publishing print products
in the Slovene language or in two languages, as well as for organizing a sports and
language week for children, to be held in two languages, including Slovene. The
central organizations received the biggest amounts of promotional funding, i.e. EUR
95,000.00 each. These are: “Rat der Kärntner Slowenen” (Council of Slovenes in
Carinthia), “Zentralverband slowenischer Organisationen” (Central Association of
Slovene Organizations), “Christlicher Kulturverband” (Christian Cultural Association)
and “Slowenischer Kulturverband” (Slovenian Cultural Association). “Gemeinschaft of
Kärntner Slowenen und Sloweninnen” (Community of Carinthian Slovenes) received
EUR 65,500.00. The Council of Slovenes in Carinthia, the Central Association of
Slovene Organizations and the Community of Carinthian Slovenes regard themselves
as organizations representing the Slovene minority in matters concerning the national
minority. They received their promotional funding mainly for maintaining their
infrastructure, i.e. rent, operating expenses, cost of staff, and partly also for office
overheads and for publishing the association newsletter. The Christian and the
Slovene Cultural Association are the umbrella organizations of the local cultural
associations and often serve in a coordinating and service function. They also received
basic promotional funding (for staff costs).
In 2006 the Slovene Cultural Association, together with a local cultural association,
implemented their own, Slovene-language theater production (“Nosorogi / The
- 120 -

Rhinoceros”), which was shown at festivals in Carinthia, Slovenia and Italy. The
Slovene Cultural Association facilities performances by professional theater groups
from Slovenia in Carinthia and promotes good and quality-oriented theater work. A
season’s ticket for Slovene theater performances war launched, which comprises 6
performances for adults and 6 performances for children and juveniles. In summer,
painting weeks for young people from Slovenia, Italy, Hungary and Austria are
organized, as well as an ethnological workshop, which young people from Austria and
Slovenia hold, monitored by qualified staff members. The research results were
published in the series of books called “Naša regija/Unsere Region” (Our Region).
Continuing training seminars for members of the local cultural associations are
organized, as well as literature days and literature workshops for bilingual juveniles
from Carinthia, Vienna, Slovenia and southern Tyrol. Another service provided is to
make available the archives of specific sheet music/theater texts of the national
minority, which the choir leaders and theater groups of the local cultural associations
may use. Continuing-training events are offered in Slovenia. Together with the local
cultural associations, the Slovene Cultural Association also organizes or helps
organize events in the Slovene language and/or specific of the national minority
(concerts and exhibitions, readings by Slovene authors in Austria, Slovenia and Italy).
Every year a Slovene-language package of books is published which is sold at
favorable rates.
The Christian Cultural Association supports its member organizations in organizing
cultural events in the Slovene language and/or specific of the national minority. It offers
seminars for continuing education, procures special literature and working tools and
publishes a Slovene-language information bulletin. It maintains archives for the specific
music of the national minority, as well as theater texts in the Slovene language and the
chronicles of associations. It organizes festivals of puppet theater and theater groups
from Slovenia and promotes the performance of own productions of the Slovene
minority. Slovene language holidays for juveniles are organized at Novo mesto
(Slovenia). Moreover, the Christian Cultural Association organizes readings by
Slovene-language authors, a Slovene-language speaking competition, and it arranges
for speakers to address the local cultural associations in various Slovene-language
lectures and presentations that are specific of the national minority.

- 121 -

The Christian Cultural Association and the Slovenian Cultural Association jointly
organized a theater workshop at Ankaran (Slovenia) in 2006. Its purpose was to assist
the youth and puppet-theater groups of the local cultural associations. 13 theater
groups and about 170 juveniles attended the workshop.
The Slovene Study Library, attached to the Slovene Cultural Association, received
EUR 34,000.00 in promotional funding from the Federal Chancellery in 2007. The
Slovene Study Library takes care of purchasing, inventorying, cataloguing and lending
media in the Slovene language and specific of the national minority, and it advises
pupils and students who need background information for presentations, seminar and
diploma papers, as well as doctoral theses. It also maintains bibliographies, both about
publications concerning Carinthian Slovenes and of literature by Slovene-speaking
Carinthian authors, of the translations of Slovene-language works by Carinthian
authors, as well as of literature by Carinthian Slovenes in the German language. The
bibliographies are published both in written form in the “Koroški koledar” and on its
web site. The Slovene Study Library maintains a traveling library which it makes
available to the various Slovene cultural associations. It also provides material to
several primary schools and nursery schools, several municipal libraries and even to
the library of the Klagenfurt penitentiary.
The Slovene Scientific Institute received EUR 11,500.00 from the budget available for
the national minorities. In addition to its own scientific work on issues of the national
minorities, the focus of its activities is an ongoing documentation of the national
minorities in Austria, especially of the Slovene national minority. To this end,
newspapers and journals are reviewed for specific articles about the national
minorities, which are archived and published in press reviews. Nowadays, the archives
are also maintained in digital form. Moreover, scientific studies, as well as
correspondence on topics relating to the national minorities are archived and
documented. The documentation materials and archives of the Scientific Institute are
also open to the public, and students, pupils and other interesting persons from
Austria, Slovenia, Italy and Germany avail themselves of these resources.
Glasbena šola, the Slovene music school, received EUR 97,000.00 from the budget of
the Federal Chancellery available for promoting the national minorities, as well as EUR
- 122 -

150,000.00 from the federal province of Carinthia. Glasbena šola gives music lessons
in Slovene or two languages to about 550 children.
“Urban Jarnik”, an ethnological association, received EUR 11,500.00 in 2007 from the
budget of the Federal Chancellery for promoting the national minorities. “Urban Jarnik”
engages in ethnological research and documentation work in the fields of historical
utensils and working tools of everyday life, including their Slovene names, which are
often dialect expressions that only the older generation still knows; Slovene folk songs;
Slovene-language topographical names for places and houses; Slovene customs and
their change in the course of time; traditional knowledge about diseases and cures.
Moreover, the association supported the setting up of the “Museum der
Alltagsgeschichte” (Museum of Everyday History) at Köstenberg/Kostanje, a Germanand Slovene-language village. The museum accommodates 400 objects from the rural
life during the 20th century. In 2002 a museum guide was published in Slovene and
German with detailed descriptions of the objects. Moreover, the association records
the life stories of Carinthian Slovenes, as well as children’s games from the settlement
area of the Carinthian Slovenes. “Urban Jarnik” maintains many contacts to institutions
in Slovenia and participates in trans-frontier projects.
With the educational center of Sodalitas at Tainach, the Slovene minority has an
important adult-education facility. It offers a wide range of courses, lectures, symposia,
some of which are held in Slovene. A bilingual (Slovene and German) program bulletin
is published. For 2007, Sodalitas received EUR 23,000.00 from the budget for
promoting the national minorities.
A few years ago, „Kulturni dom Pilberk“, a multi-functional event center was built at
Bleiburg, where many associations of the Slovene minority stage their events. The
operating association received EUR 13,000.00 in 2007 for operating costs from the
budget available to promote the national minorities.
In Klagenfurt the Slovene minority has two student homes offering both boardingschool facilities as well as afternoon tutoring in the Slovene language. These options
are mainly used by the pupils of the federal grammar school for Slovenes and the
bilingual commercial college in Klagenfurt. Moreover, there are two day nurseries with
Slovene and bilingual tutoring for pupils of the bilingual primary schools in Klagenfurt.
- 123 -

„Hermagoras“, an association, received EUR 68,570.00 in the year 2007 from the
budget for promoting the national minorities for operating its dormitory, day nursery
and bilingual primary school. The “Slowenischer Schulverein” (Slovenian School
Association“ received EUR 69,075.00 for its dormitory and day nursery. The convent of
the School Sisters at St. Peter bei St. Jakob im Rosental operates a bilingual (Slovene
and German) upper-level secondary school for business occupations with an attached
boarding school. This project received EUR 55,130.00 in 2007 from the budget
available for promoting the national minorities.
There are also three publishing houses specializing in literature in the Slovene
language and specific of the national minority. However, initially they were not
supported with funding from the budget for promoting the national minorities because,
as a matter of principle, funding for the promotion of the national minorities cannot be
allocated to commercial enterprises.
Letter d:
§ 1 (3) letter f) of the Promotion of Culture Act, Provincial Law Gazette No. 45/2002,
defines the purpose of promoting activities as follows, inter alia:
„to preserve the cultural diversity of the cultural region of Carinthia, which
is due to the various ethnic influences, including the influence of the
Slovene national minority
§ 5 (?) letter d) of the Carinthian Regional Museums Act lists the following as one the
principles governing the tasks of museums:
“to open up and to document the cultural diversity of the cultural region of
Carinthia, which is due to the various ethnic influences, including the
influence of the Slovene national minority, as well as the mutual
exchanges with the neighboring regions.”
Letter f:
The “Kärntner Kulturwoche der Kärntner Slowenen” (Carinthian Cultural Week of the
Carinthian Slovenes” should be mentioned here as a particularly positive example.
This year it was held for the 15th time, i.e. at Millstatt from 20 to 24 May 2007. It is
organized by the Carinthian Office for the National Minorities, together with the
respective organizing town outside the autochthonous settlement area. In the course of
the week, cultural events are staged every day by the Slovene national minority in the
fields of theater, film, choir, concerts and alike.

- 124 -

In 2004, “Urban Jarnik”, the Slovene ethnological institute, helped the Regional
Museum of Carinthia to prepare an exhibition about Alpine and shepherds’ horns by
obtaining exhibition objects from the Slovene region. Moreover, it supported contacts
between the director of the ethnological collection of the Regional Museum of Carinthia
and ethnological institutions in Slovenia.
Paragraph 2:
The allocation of funding to promote the national minorities does not depend on
whether the activity or institution to be promoted is located in the autochthonous
settlement area of the national minority or not. For example, Slovene-language
organizations of the national minority located in Vienna or Graz also receive funding
from the budget for the national minorities.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example).
The Austrian embassy and the Cultural Forum Laibach/Ljubljana reported that several
projects of members of the Austrian national minority were promoted, most of which
were by members of the Slovene national minority. Below is an overview of the
projects for the years 2005 to 2007:

Zusammenarbeit“ (Weeks of Trans-Frontier Cooperation)
Round Table – “Unsere gemeinsame europäische Zukunft –
grenzüberschreitende Kooperationen im Lichte der slowenischen EUPräsidentschaft“ (Our Common European Future – Trans-Frontier Cooperation
with a View to the EU Presidency) with Carinthian Slovenes participating in the
“Wochen der grenzüberschreitenden Zusammenarbeit“ (Weeks of TransFrontier Cooperation

The Austrian embassy and the Cultural Forum Belgrade report that it has been
possible to recruit a young culture manager, a Carinthian Slovene, to work as a
volunteer for one year at the Cultural Forum in the year 2006. This woman launched
numerous projects and, time and again, advised artists from among the Carinthian
Slovenes and helped them to establish contacts to the Serbian cultural scene. The
Cultural Forum Belgrade specifically promotes projects that are launched by
representatives of the Austrian national minorities or in which their representatives
participate. On the occasion of the Belgrade Book Fair in October 2007, Loize Wieser,
who specializes in publishing Eastern-European literature, was awarded a prize for
promoting Serbian literature.
Article 13 (Economic and social life):
Paragraph 1, letter d:
This provision is implemented, first and foremost, by the ban on discriminating against
speakers of minority languages (for details see the comments on Article 7 (2)), as well
- 126 -

as by Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, which has constitutional ranking
and guarantees the right to use any language in private and business intercourses.
In addition, impulses are given time and again by the promotional activities in order to
support the use of the minority languages in economic and social life. In 2006, for
example, the “Bäuerliche Bildungsgemeinschaft” (Farmers’ Educational Cooperation)
published a glossary of technical terms in the field of farming technologies with support
from the budget available to promote the national minorities.
The Slovene Business Association Carinthia is a private association of Slovene
entrepreneurs and business experts in Carinthia. Its tasks include, inter alia, to help
establish contacts among the members of the association, as well as to customers and
suppliers in the Alpen-Adria region, as well as to provide information to members about
business and fiscal matters and the specific technical training in the Slovene language.
In December 2006 the Slovene Business Association received funding from the budget
available for the national minorities (EUR 2,500.00) to organize three workshops on
the subject of “Preparing the National Minority for the New EU Financial Period 20072013”, where the new EU promotional programs were presented, in particular.
Article 14 (Trans-frontier exchanges):
Letter b:
ARGE Alpen-Adria plays a special role in maintaining trans-frontier exchanges. The
activities and stimuli from ARGE Alpen-Adria were an important contribution for
creating more awareness and giving more intensive consideration to minority issues in
Central Europe. By mutually learning about possible solutions it may be possible to
contribute towards mitigating conflicts in the member regions. It is generally seen to be
a positive effect of the events organized by ARGE Alpen-Adria to date that members of
the various minorities were given an opportunity to get into direct contacts with each
other and to get to know each other in course of the cultural activities. A direct
cooperation between the regional authorities results already from the fact that the
federal province of Carinthia is a member of ARGE Alpen-Adria, and as such it is
represented by its provincial governor.

- 127 -

The organizations of the Slovene national minority, in particular, cooperate very
intensively with organizations, artists and also state bodies in Slovenia, but also in
Italy. The following examples do by no means constitute a complete list. One should
mention “Urban Jarnik”, the ethnological institute, which cooperates with the museum
at Ravne and the Slovenian municipalities of Žiri and Prevalje and maintains contacts
to the Museum for Ethnography (Etnografski muzej), the Institute for Slovene
Ethnography (Inštitut za slovensko narodopisje) and the Institute for Music
Ethnography (Glasbeno-narodpisni inštitut) at the Academy of Sciences and the Arts in
Laibach/Ljubljana. One should also mention the Slovenian Scientific Institute which
cooperates with the Institute for Issues of the National Minorities in Laibach/Ljubljana,
as well as the Slovene Study Library that cooperates in the COBISS project (Slovene
library data base). Whenever invited by cultural associations, Slovene theaters will
perform in Carinthia.
During the 2006/2007 school year, “Mladinski dom”, the youth center of the Slovene
School Association in Klagenfurt, was a partner in the Leonardo da Vinci project of
“Srednja vzgojiteljska šola in Gimnazija v Ljubljani” (Middle School for Teachers and
Grammar Schools in Laibach/Ljubljana). In the course of the project, a total of 19
pupils of that upper-lever secondary school were guests of the youth center for one
month each. At the same time, they worked as trainees in a bilingual nursery school in
Carinthia. Further partners of the project were the Federal Educational Institute for
Nursery-School Pedagogy in Klagenfurt, Delovna skupnost privatnih dvo- in
večjezičnih vrtcev / Arge zwei- und mehrsprachiger Kindergärten (Working Party of
Bilingual and Multi-Lingual Nursery Schools) and the parent-teachers’ association at
the Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy in Klagenfurt. In the course
of the exchange program, students of the Austrian Federal Training Institute for
Nursery-School Pedagogy worked as trainees in Laibach/Ljubljana. In addition, every
year the teachers’ council takes part in a continuing-training seminar in Slovenia. The
Slovene school association in Klagenfurt also maintains lively contacts with “Srednja
vzgojiteljska šola in gimnazija v Ljubljani”, which was mentioned before, with regard to
theater performances by children. In this context, every year one to two theater
performances by students of that school are offered in the course of their excursions to
the Mladinski dom youth center, where they play for the children of the “Sonce” nursery
school, the ABCČ day nursery (also accommodated at the youth center) and for the
younger pupils of the youth center. On the level of pupils’ dormitories, the Slovene
- 128 -

school association also maintains close contacts with “Dijaški dom Lizike Jančar«
(pupils' dormitories) in Marburg/Maribor. During the 2005/2006 school year, these
contacts were intensified through the „Skriti zaklad“ project (The Hidden Treasure),
whereas before these contacts had been limited to mutual annual visits. One further
example of trans-frontier cooperation is „Filmkreis - Filmski krožek - Mladinski dom“,
which organizes film workshops in addition to working with juveniles from Slovenia and
Italy on an ongoing basis throughout the school year. The workshops were held at
Piran, Slovenia, in 2003, at Portorož, Slovenia in 2004, and in Klagenfurt in the years
2005 to 2007.
Every year, a special “Educational Day of the Youth Center“ is held at the youth center
of the Slovene School Association. For the program, lectures and workshops are
organized for the pedagogical staff, for the pupils of the Mladinski dom youth center
and for the parents. The workshops are moderated by renowned experts in pedagogy,
communications or psychology from Slovenia.
The bilingual nursery schools in Carinthia maintain a wide range of visiting contacts
with nursery schools in Slovenia. The Working Party of Private Bilingual and MultiLingual Nursery Schools organized continuing-training events for bilingual teachers,
inviting lecturers from Slovenia, and it organized an excursion to a nursery school in
Slovenia.
Time and again, the association “Gabriel – Musiktheater, Film und Medien” (Gabriel –
Music Theater, Film and the Media) cooperates with Slovene artists and stages
performances both in Austria and in Slovenia.
“Peter Marković”, a cultural association, reported that it maintains partnership contacts
to the cultural association at Bohinj, Slovenia, in the course of which members
participate in the events of the respectively other cultural association.
The association “OK Petzenmarathon Kralj Matjaž” reports that it did not organize the
trans-frontier marathon run in 2007, which it had still organized in the year 2006.
However, it continues to maintain contacts with its neighbors in Slovenia by organizing
the joint participation in various running events in Slovenia and Austria.
- 129 -

On 16 May 2007, the Mixed Commission, set up pursuant to Article 20 of the
Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Republic of Slovenia on
Cooperation in the Fields of Culture, Education and Science, adopted the second
program for the implementation of the agreement, which will be in force as of 2008.
The program expressly welcomes, inter alia, the trans-frontier activities and contacts of
the educational institutes for nursery-school pedagogy, the universities for pedagogy
and the university departments for pedagogy, of the Slovene Scientific Institute in
Klagenfurt, of “Urban Jarnik”, the ethnographical institute in Klagenfurt and of the
Slovene Study Library in Klagenfurt.

III.3. Hungarian in the Hungarian Language Region of the Federal
Province of Burgenland:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1
Letter a ii:
The first linguistic experience of every child is the basis from which to begin languagelearning, as well as to specifically promote the linguistic development of children. In
addition to the family situation, nursery schools also play an important role.
The 1995 Nursery-School Act for Burgenland stipulates in § 2a which nursery schools
must also offer Hungarian, in addition to German. At present, there are 9 public
nursery schools, where German and Hungarian are spoken. The regional government
hires assistant nursery-school teachers for those nursery schools that do not have
nursery-school teachers with bilingual qualifications among their staff.
The parents (minimum: 25%) may apply to the regional authorities for the recruitment
of an assistant nursery-school teacher for the Hungarian language in case the nursery
school does not have to operated as a bilingual nursery school under the nurseryschool law for Burgenland.
With the amendment of the Burgenland nursery-school law of 8 July 2005, the use of
the Hungarian language was extended from a minimum of nine to twelve hours per
- 130 -

week in the bilingual public nursery schools. Parents, who do not wish that their
children are taken care of in two languages, may sign off their children from the
respective group.
The Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy at Oberwart offers training
in Hungarian, as well as bilingual didactics.
Letter b ii:
Austria’s school laws make sure that an education in the Hungarian language can be
obtained in the framework of the public school system from the pre-school level up to
the school-leaving examination.
The Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland, as well as the corresponding implementing
laws of the federal province of Burgenland state that classes in primary schools must
be taught in Hungarian and/or in two languages in municipalities with a Hungarianspeaking population. The two language portions of the bilingual instruction should be
more or less balanced. Parents who do not wish that their children are taught in
Hungarian may sign off of their children. These children must, however, remain with
the pupils of that class. In case of a sustained demand, there is also the entitlement to
be taught in the language of the national minority in schools outside the autochthonous
settlement area.
§ 6 (1) of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland (Federal Law Gazette No.
641/1994) stipulates that bilingual primary schools must be available in those
municipalities so that all members, if possible, of the Hungarian national minority who
signed up for attending a bilingual primary school can actually attend such a school
Pursuant to § 7 (1) the entire territory of the federal province of Burgenland must be
divided in so-called entitlement districts, so that persons outside the Hungarian
language area of Burgenland can also benefit from bilingual instruction.
Furthermore, it is the goal of educating pupils in the bilingual primary schools of the
Burgenland region to familiarize the pupils with the values of bilingualism on a
cognitive and emotional level
-

So that they can cope with practical needs,

- 131 -

-

for successfully engaging in positive communication and cooperation processes
in the respective individual surroundings,

-

for making personal contributions to the peaceful co-existence of the national
minorities.

The Minorities Schools’ Act for Burgenland stipulates that instruction in the Hungarian
language shall be given at lower-level secondary schools, at a separate general upperlevel secondary school and, in addition, also at other schools in Burgenland in the form
of so-called “special language-learning options”, which means at public schools in
Burgenland in general. The comments contained under letter b ii also apply to the
requirements for setting up a bilingual lower-lever secondary school.

Lower-level secondary schools in the area of bilingual primary schools must also offer
instruction in the Hungarian language. Here, the pupils must sign up for instruction in
the language of the national minority. Instruction in that language must be offered as of
the registration of the first pupil.
- 135 -

§ 12 of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland requires a bilingual general upperlevel secondary school. That school is located at Oberwart. The bilingual grammar
school at Oberwart offers instruction in Hungarian and German and/or Croatian and
German up to the level for university admission. Moreover, several general upper-level
secondary schools also teach Hungarian classes of various types as an additional
education. The classes may range from optional compulsory subjects to optional
exercises. Similar arrangements can be found in upper-level vocational schools.

pupils for their choice of an occupation by providing vocational guidance, as well as to
provide basic vocational training. In addition, the Minorities’ Schools Act for
Burgenland also facilitates bilingual instruction at the vocational schools.

Letter e iii:
On account of the autonomy of universities, regulated by law, state intervention in the
study courses offered by universities is only possible to a limited extent. In fact,
though, Hungarian is being offered as a study course at several Austrian universities:
-

University of Vienna, Institute for Finno-Ugric Studies

-

University of Vienna, Institute for Translator and Interpreter Training

-

Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, Institute for Slavic
Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Theoretical and Applied Translation Sciences

At the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, Hungarian is
taught as an optional subject. Hungarian is also taught at the University of Vienna,
namely at the diploma course in Slavic studies, for the bachelor’s degree in translation
and interpreting, as a teaching qualification, as well as at the language courses of the
Language Center of the University of Vienna. There is also a broad range of studies
that are offered at the University of Vienna which are linked to the languages of the
national minorities.
It is compulsory to learn one of the Eastern-European languages at the University of
Applied Science for International Business Relations in Eisenstadt. Hungarian may be
chosen among other languages. The University of Applied Science at Pinkafeld offers
Hungarian as a second living foreign language.
Letter f iii:
The “Burgenländisch-Ungarische Volkshochschule” (Burgenland-Hungarian Adult
Education College) made use of the right to set up private education and training
facilities. It offers, inter alia, courses in Hungarian. Various organizations of the

- 137 -

national minority also offer courses in Hungarian. Most of the courses are supported
with federal funding for the promotion of the national minorities.
Letter g:
The statutory situation is the same here as for the Burgenland-Croatian minority and
the Slovene national minority. There is compliance with this provision especially on
account of the curricula that incorporate history and culture.
The very comprehensive and detailed ordinance of the Federal Ministry of Education,
which determines the curricula for minority primary schools and for instruction of the
minority languages in the primary schools and lower-level secondary schools of the
federal provinces of Burgenland and Carinthia (Federal Law Gazette 1966/118, as last
amended by Federal Law Gazette II 1998/309), contains the following summary in
connection with teaching the history and culture of the members of the national
minorities:
“The aspects of inter-cultural learning, with special emphasis on the
cultural heritage of the respective national minority, are most likely to be
developed in those federal provinces of Austria where children belonging
to a minority and/or Austrian and foreign children are taught together. In
the course of dealing with the respectively other cultural heritage, such
aspects as lifestyle habits, language, customs, texts (for example stories,
tales and legends), traditions, songs, etc., must be dealt with, in
particular. Inter-cultural learning is not restricted to learning about other
cultures. Rather, the issue is to learn together and to understand, to
experience and help shape cultural values. What is also required is to
arouse interest in and curiosity for the cultural differences, so that not
only cultural unity but also cultural diversity can be experienced as
something valuable.”
Letter h:
In 2008 a new study course for the basic and continuing training of teachers for the
Hungarian language was launched at the newly founded Pedagogical University.
Letter i:
In keeping with the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland a separate department has
been set up with the regional school inspectorate for matters relating to the national
minorities. A special inspector for Hungarian is responsible for inspecting the
compulsory schools. A school inspector with language competences is responsible for
the inspections at the other school types.

- 138 -

Paragraph 2:
§ 6 (3) as well as § 10 (3) of the Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland stipulate that, if
necessary, bilingual instruction shall also be offered outside the autochthonous
settlement area of the national minority in Burgenland.
Article 9 (Judicial Authorities):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a ii:
According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Hungarian, the Hungarian language has been admitted as
official language, in addition to the German language, before the local courts of
Oberpullendorf and Oberwart, as well as before the Regional Court Eisenstadt.
Everybody can therefore apply that he/she may use Hungarian as the official language
in penal proceedings conducted against them before these courts. If the provisions on
official languages are violated, the title to be heard in court is regarded as having been
violated. The sanction pursuant to § 17 (2) of the National Minorities Act for violations
of the provisions on official languages at trials in criminal proceedings is nullity of the
court decision:
“Whenever the trial in criminal court proceedings has not been conducted
in the language of the national minority, contrary to § 15, this constitutes
nullity, as defined in § 281 (1) item 3 of the 1975 Code of Criminal
Procedure. This reason for nullity cannot be claimed to the detriment of
the person who filed the application pursuant to § 15 (2) (to use the
language of he national minority), but to his advantage, irrespective as to
whether the violation of form could have had an influence on the decision
…”
Letter a iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision, according to which documents or other
pieces of evidence in criminal proceedings may only be submitted in a specific
language. The court shall translate or have translated, without delay, oral and written
submissions in the Hungarian language.
Letter a ii and letter a iii:
The costs and fees for translations which a court produces or has produced, shall be
borne ex officio. When assessing the amount of lump-sum costs of criminal
proceedings, the costs of an interpreter, called in pursuant to the provisions of the
- 139 -

National Minorities Act, shall not be taken into account (§ 22 (1) of the National
Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 381 (1) item 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).
If a party (person concerned) in criminal court proceedings is represented or defended
by an attorney-at-law or a penal-law counsel, the Federal State pays the fee of that
attorney-at-law or penal-law counsel for the last third of such proceedings which re
also conducted in the Hungarian language.
Letter b ii:
On the basis of the same provisions as mentioned in letter a, a party may use
Hungarian as an official language in civil proceedings before the same courts. A
person who intends to us Hungarian, as the official language, in an oral hearing shall
inform the court thereof without delay upon being served the summons. If a person is
found guilty of failing to provide this information in time, that person may be required to
pay for the additional costs incurred in this case. This obligation to provide information
does not apply to proceedings that are conducted on the basis of a submission
prepared in Hungarian. The information by the party on the use of the Hungarian
language applies for the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is
revoked. If the German or Hungarian language is not used, or if the use of the
Hungarian language is not admitted – contrary to the provisions on official language (§
13 and following of the National Minorities Act) – the title of the party to be heard by
court is deemed to have been violated in the respective step of the proceedings to
whose detriment the violation has occurred.
Letter b iii:
Austrian law does not contain a provision which stipulates that documents or other
pieces of evidence in civil proceedings may only be submitted in a specific language.
The court must cover the costs of translation ex officio, which the court has to produce
or to obtain pursuant to the provisions on official language (§ 13 and following of the
National Minorities Act).
The Federal Ministry of Justice communicated that seven persons, including three
judges, had Hungarian language skills at the Local Court Oberwart in 2004.
Letter c ii:
Pursuant to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 4 of
the Ordinance on the Use of Hungarian an Official Language, Hungarian is admitted as
- 140 -

an additional official language before the Independent Administrative Senate for
Burgenland (an administrative authority according to Austrian law, but a tribunal as
defined in Article 6 of the Human Rights Convention). The details of its provisions
correlate in essence with the comments made above. § 17 (3) of the National
Minorities Act, in conjunction with § 68 (4) item 4 of the General Administrative
Proceedings Act sanctions violations of § 15 of the National Minorities Act, which
governs the use of the Hungarian language in proceedings, by rendering the Senate’s
decision null and void.
Letter c iii:
Austrian legislation on administrative proceedings, too, which applies to proceedings
before Independent Administrative Senates, does not contain any obligation to submit
pieces of evidence only in a specific language.
Letter d:
§ 22 of the National Minorities Act makes sure that a party does not incur any
additional costs when resorting to the use of the Hungarian language as an official
language. § 22 of the cited law reads as follows:
§ 22. (1) Costs and fees for translations which an authority or service unit
must produce or obtain pursuant to the present federal law shall be
covered ex officio. When assessing the lump-sum contribution to costs
pursuant to § 381 (1) item 1 of the 1975 Code of Criminal Procedure, the
costs of an interpreter/translator, recruited in accordance with the present
federal law, shall not be taken into account.
(2) (Constitutional provision) If the proceedings were also conducted in
the language of a national minority, only two thirds of the actually
required time input (for the length of a hearing) shall be used as a basis
when assessing the fees that a territorial corporation shall receive and
that are calculated according to the time input.
(3) If – on account of the present federal law – a paper must be produced
directly in two official languages, the stamp fee shall be due for only one
of the copies.
(4) If a party in court proceedings (a party involved) is represented or
defended by a legal counsel, a criminal-law counsel or a notary public,
the Federal State shall pay for the last third of the fee of such legal
counsel, criminal-law counsel or notary public, incurred in such
proceedings (hearings) that are also conducted in the language of a
national minority. Payment of that amount of the fee shall be claimed
always before the end of such a hearing or such proceedings by
submitting a statement of costs, with the loss of this claim being forfeited
otherwise; the judge shall decide on the amount of the fee immediately
and instruct the accounting officer to pay this amount to the legal counsel,
- 141 -

criminal-law counsel or notary public. This additional fee expense shall be
assessed in such a way as though the opponent of the person entitled to
this claim were obliged by law to refund these costs to that party.
Paragraph 2:
Letter a:
As was mentioned before, the validity of a legal document does not depend on the
language in which it is drawn up.
Article 10 (Administrative authorities and public services):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a iii and letter c:
§ 3 of the Ordinance on the Use of Hungarian as an Official Language also mentions
two district administrative authorities, i.e. Oberpullendorf and Oberwart, in addition to
two local courts, before which Hungarian is admitted as an official language. § 4 (1) of
the cited law also stipulates as general facts of a case that Hungarian shall also be
admitted as an official language before the other authorities and service units of the
Federal State and the provincial government with offices in Burgenland, the
geographical competences of which coincide in full or in part with the geographical
competences of the aforementioned district administrative authorities and/or local
courts, if Hungarian were admitted as an official language in a case in which one of the
district administrative authorities or local courts had subject-matter competences in the
case in question, or if the authority has competences as a legal-remedy instance in
proceedings that were conducted before an authority on a first-instance basis, where
Hungarian is admitted as an official language in addition to the German language.
Hungarian as an official language shall also be used at police stations that have
geographical competences that coincide in full or in part with the municipalities listed in
§ 2 of the cited law (a total of four). In exceptional cases, Hungarian is also admitted as
an official language before authorities located in Vienna, i.e. federal authorities
headquartered in Vienna, if their district coincides fully or in part with the district of one
of the aforementioned local courts or district administrative authorities. Hungarian is
admitted as an official language, in addition to the German language, before the
Military Command for Burgenland or the Recruitment Commission in Vienna or the
Recruitment Commission of Styria, if the former uses the services of the two latter
units, whenever the matters relate to supplementary military issues.
- 142 -

According to § 13 and following of the National Minorities Act, in conjunction with the
Ordinance on the Use of Hungarian as an Official Language, an Austrian national (as
well as nationals of another EU State) may inform the aforementioned authorities that
he/she wishes to use to the language of the national minority. No separate information
to this effect is required whenever the proceedings are conducted on the basis of a
submission drawn up in the language of the national minority. The information applies
for the full length of the subsequent proceedings, unless it is revoked. In particular, the
right to use the language of the national minority comprises the right to submit written
or oral submissions, as well as the right to be served decisions by or orders of the
authority concerned in the German and Hungarian languages.
Paragraph 2:
Letter b:
Please refer to the information in connection with the preceding paragraph. The
municipal authorities of the four municipalities listed in § 2 of the Ordinance on the Use
of Hungarian as an Official Language, as well as those two district administrative
authorities, in which these municipalities are located, i.e. Oberpullendorf and Oberwart,
especially qualify as local or regional authorities, as defined in the provisions of the
Charter. Hungarian is also admitted as an official language before the Office of the
Burgenland Provincial Government. The right to use Hungarian as a language of a
national minority especially comprises the right to submit written and oral applications
in this language.
Letter d:
Moreover, § 13 (4) of the National Minorities Act empowers the municipalities listed in
the ordinance on the Use of Hungarian as an Official Language to use the language of
the national minority also for general public announcements.
Paragraph 4:
Letter a:
Written and oral applications in Hungarian, submitted in proceedings before the
aforementioned administrative authorities conducted in Hungarian as the official
language shall be translated into German ex officio (§ 14 of the National Minorities
Act). Pursuant to § 15 of the cited law, an interpreter shall be called in, if necessary. If
- 143 -

minutes of these proceedings are prepared in German, they shall be translated into
Hungarian without any delay. The costs incurred by such translation or interpreting
assignments shall be covered ex officio, pursuant to § 22 of the cited law.
Paragraph 5:
According to § 21 of the Civil Status Act, in conjunction with § 154 of the Austrian Civil
Law Code, a child is generally given his or her first name by the parents. There is no
requirement under Austrian law that the name must be in German, nor does the
surname have to be in German. This also derives from § 5 (3) of the Civil Status
Ordinance, according to which a person's names, which are to be registered on the
basis of a document presented in Latin letters, must be recorded in the original letters
and characters. This means that diacritic characters not used in the German language
must also be used. However, the civil-status registers must be kept in the German
language (§ 18 of the national Minorities Act). Whenever documents are submitted for
registration in the civil-status registers that are in a language of a national minority, the
authority shall have them translated. Inversely, excerpts from the civil-status registers
shall be issued as translations into the language of the respective national minority, if
so requested (§ 20 of the National Minorities Act). In keeping with the case law of the
Constitutional Court (Constitutional Court decision of 5 March 1996, file number VfSlg.
No. 14.452/1996), the foregoing shall also apply if it was not possible to conduct the
procedure resulting in the register entry (e.g. marriage ceremony) in the language of
the national minority, in the absence of an application to this effect by the member of
the national minority.
An amendment of the Names Modification Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 25/1995)
resulted in a large measure of liberalization concerning the possibility to modify one’s
name. The members of a national minority, who already have a name, converted into
German, have the possibility to assume once again their original name in the language
of the national minority. Under the amended legislation, one may modify one’s name
for any random reason. However, an important reason is required if this change of
name is to be carried out free of charge. A member of a national minority may use the
important reason pursuant to § 2 (1) item 10 of the Names Modification Act, which
states that the intended change of name is necessary in order to avoid unreasonable
disadvantages in his/her social relations and that these drawbacks cannot be avoided
- 144 -

in any other way. According to § 2 (2) of the Names Modification Act, this reason also
applies to a change of the first name.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1:
Letter b ii and letter c ii:
Amendments of the federal law on Austria’s broadcasting corporation (ORF Act)
entered into force on 1 January 2002. Pursuant to § 5 (1) of the ORF Act, the Austrian
Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) is now required to broadcast a commensurate portion
of its programs in the languages of the national minorities for which national minority
advisory boards have been set up. The broadcasting times shall be laid down on an
annual basis, after hearing the Audience’s Council. Moreover, pursuant to § 28 (4) of
the ORF Act a seat in the Audience’s Council of the ORF is reserved to a member of
the national minorities. According to § 30 (1) of the ORF Act, the Audience’s Council
proposes measures, inter alia, to comply with this statutory obligation and comments
on the program portions for national minorities which are to be counted as
broadcasting times. The amendment of the ORF Act also facilitated the cooperation
between the ORF and private radio stations.
Every day and/or week, the regional broadcasting station (Landesstudio Burgenland)

The comments on programs available via the Internet for other national minorities also
apply here.
Letter d:
CDs and CD-ROMs with language courses in the languages of the national minorities,
video works and theater productions, for example, are funded from the federal
promotional budget for the national minorities.
Letter e i:
“Örség”, the periodically published newspaper in Hungarian, is supported with
promotional funding for the national minorities, just as the other information bulletins in
Hungarian. Moreover, „Napocska“, a newspaper for children in Hungarian, and “cooltúra“, a newspaper for juveniles, also receive funding from the budget to promote the
national minorities. In general, it must be stated that, as a matter of principle,
promoting the publication of newspapers and other print products is of great
importance from the perspective of policies for the national minorities.
Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Hungarian language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs from Hungarian can be received in Burgenland without any restrictions.

- 147 -

Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
In the framework of promotional activities for the national minorities, numerous cultural
facilities and activities, which deal with preserving the Hungarian language, are
supported. All types of cultural facilities and areas of activities, as listed in Article 12 (1)
of the Charter, may be supported from the funding available for the national minorities.
In the year 2007, 9 organizations of the Hungarian national minority and church
facilities located in Burgenland received promotional funding from the budget for the
national minorities in the total amount of EUR 204,560.00. An amount of EUR
134,000.00 went to the Burgenland-Hungarian cultural association for the following
items:
-

for rent, operating costs, insurance of the association premises, staff expenses,
office overhead costs
for the publication of various Hungarian or bilingual periodicals (“Őrvidéki hírek“,
the association newsletter; “Napocska“, a newspaper for children, “Cool-túra“, a
newspaper for juveniles, “Őrség“, a year-book)
for organizing the Takács Jenő-Memorial Symposium in Hungarian or two
languages
for the theater group of the association
for the singing group of the association
for organizing lectures and a concert in commemoration of Zoltán Koldály, the
Hungarian folklore song researcher, composer and adult educator

“Ungarisches Institut“ / Hungarian Institute)
for fees for Hungarian or bilingual teaching of folk dancing to the folklore dance
group of the association, for choreography and musical accompaniment, for
buying national costumes

- 148 -

UMIZ – “Verein zur Förderung des ungarischen Medien- und Informationszentrum”
(Association for the Promotion of the Hungarian Media and Information Center)
received EUR 31,150.00 in the year 2007 from the budget of the Federal Chancellery
for promoting the national minorities. The focus of activities of this association is on
library and archiving services. The association is especially committed to applying
modern technologies; it cooperates with educational facilities in Hungary, as well as
with the Hungarian minorities in Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia and
Croatia. UMIZ has 8 Internet work stations, as well as two servers. The work stations
are used in the framework of cooperation projects (for example, the primary school at
Unterwart holds e-learning lessons at UMIZ on a regular basis), by children and
juveniles in the course of the afternoon programs, by members of the association, by
students and research workers. UMIZ currently has about 25,000 media units, of which
about 90% are in Hungarian. The association has a rental service. Moreover, it
operates two servers that host several platforms of the institute, as well as the web
sites

national

minority

www.umiz.at/theaterverein).

The

(e.g.
site

managed by UMIZ (www.eduhu.net) comprises programs to learn Hungarian;
www.langos.at offers news from Burgenland and Hungarian-language areas abroad,
both in German and Hungarian, as well as the periodicals published by other Austrian
associations of the Hungarian minority.

A Hungarian dictionary is available at

www.umiz.at; Hungarian radio and television programs can also be received on-line
from this site.
The adult education college of the Burgenland Hungarians received EUR 11,870.00 in
the year 2007 from the budget for promoting the national minorities to cover staff costs,
to pay for the use of the office and teaching facilities, including the attaching
infrastructure, as well as to promote projects for Öri-banda, a group preserving
tradition and belonging to the association, and to publish a text book on BurgenlandHungarian folk music. The association regularly offers Hungarian courses and lectures
on specific topics of the national minority, as well as cultural events. In 2005 the
association produced a CD with Burgenland-Hungarian folk music. The adult education
college has been recognized as an ECL examination center (European Consortium for
the Certificate of Attainment in Modern Languages) for the Hungarian language. In
2003, the project “Ungarisch Plus - Sprachinitiative der Volkshochschule der
Burgenländischen Ungarn“ (Hungarian Plus – Language Initiative of the Adult
- 149 -

Education College of the Burgenland Hungarians) was awarded the European Seal for
innovative language projects.
On 300 m² of exhibition space, the “Heimathaus” center at Unterwart documents the
life of the Hungarian minority in the Wart region in former times. It has a wealth of
exhibits relating to farming and household work, as well as the historical workshop
equipment of shoemakers, blacksmiths, coach-makers and carpenters, in addition to
traditional costumes. In 2007, the association of the “Heimathaus” center at Unterwart
received EUR 1,270.00 from the budget for promoting the national minorities.
Theater in the Hungarian language is promoted by amateur theater groups of the
Hungarian theater association at Unterwart and the reading association of the
Reformed Youth Group at Oberwart.
The Hungarian cultural association for central Burgenland received EUR 17,620.00 in
the year 2007 for maintaining the association premises, for a number of projects such
as Hungarian as well as for bilingual services to look after children, for the choir, for
publishing the bilingual (German and Hungarian) news bulletin of the association,
organizing events with a program that is specific of the national minority, as well as for
organizing a language holiday camp for children in Hungary.
The Roman-Catholic parish at Oberwart received funding for staging the traditional
Hungarian Nativity plays.
Paragraph 2:
The allocation of funding to promote the national minorities does not depend on
whether the activity or institution to be promoted is located in the autochthonous
settlement area of the national minority or not. For example, Hungarian-language
organizations of the national minority located in the federal provinces of Salzburg,
Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria also receive funding from the budget for the national
minorities.

- 150 -

Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example).
Article 13 (Economic and social life):
Paragraph 1 letter d:
This provision is implemented, first and foremost, by the ban on discriminating against
speakers of minority languages (for details see the comments on Article 7 (2)), as well
as by Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, which has constitutional ranking
and guarantees the right to use any language in private and business transactions. In
addition, promoting measures provide impulses that are intended to facilitate the use of
the Hungarian language in business and social life. For example, the Roman-Catholic
parish at Mittelpullendorf published a book of religious song in Hungarian with support
from the budget for promoting the national minorities.
Article 14 (Trans-frontier exchanges):
Letter b:
ARGE Alpen-Adria plays a special role in maintaining trans-frontier exchanges. The
activities and stimuli from ARGE Alpen-Adria were an important contribution for
creating more awareness and giving more intensive consideration to minority issues in
Central Europe. By mutually learning about possible solutions it was possible to
contribute towards mitigating conflicts in the member regions. It is generally seen to be
a positive effect of the events organized by ARGE Alpen-Adria to date that members of
the various minorities were given an opportunity to get into direct contacts with each
other, as well as to get to know each other in course of the cultural activities. A direct
cooperation between the regional authorities results already from the fact that the
federal province of Burgenland is a member of ARGE Alpen-Adria, and as such it is
represented by its provincial governor.
In November 2007, the Imre Samu Sprachkompetenzzentrum (Imre Samu Language
Competence Center – ISSZ) was set up at UMIZ – “Verein zur Förderung des
ungarischen Medien- und Informationszentrums“. It is an integral part of the UMIZ
- 151 -

structure and serves as an advisory board for philological issues. The objectives and
trans-frontier concerns of the Hungarian Academy of Science were coordinated when
setting up this institute as a component of the network of cooperating scientific
institutions serving the purpose of philological research. The ISSZ coordinates
research into the Hungarian language in Burgenland/Austria, Slovenia and Croatia. It
is planned, inter alia, to establish a data base to document the Hungarian vernacular of
the Wart region in video and sound recordings. Between June 2007 and April 2008,
UMIZ is implementing an Interreg project in cooperation with a youth club at
Zalaegerszeg (Hungary), in the course of which an Internet platform is to be produced
of those associations that are active in the “Euroregio Western Pannonia”. Exchange
programs for juveniles from Burgenland and western Hungary will eventually be
organized.
The project “Zu zweit geht es besser“ – Interkulturelle Begegnung im neuen Europa“ (It
is easier when you do it together – Inter-Cultural Encounters in the New Europe) of
“Fachhochschulstudiengänge Burgenland GmbH” (Study Courses in Applied Science)
relates to partnerships with neighboring countries to the east, including Hungary. It
received the European Seal for innovative language projects in 2007.
One should mention the language holiday camp for children at Lake Balaton, which
has become a traditional event in the meantime. It is organized by the BurgenlandHungarian Cultural Association. The adult education college of the Burgenland
Hungarians carries out the project “Freie Sommeruniversität in Siget in der Wart“ (Free
Summer University at Siget in the Wart Region), to which juveniles and lecturers from
Hungary are invited.

III.4. The Czech Language in the Federal Province of Vienna:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a iv:
The Komensky School Association, which is the private bilingual educational facility
with public-law status, offers bilingual instruction and education from the nursery- 152 -

school level to the school-leaving examination in Czech/Slovak and German. This
school is operated by the Komensky School Association. In 2007/2008, a total of 80
children as of the age of two attended the nursery school of the Komensky School, of
59 had Czech as their mother tongue. They are cared for in 4 groups, partly together
with children having German, Slovak or Hungarian as their mother tongue.
The Komensky School Association also receives federal funding from the budget for
promoting the national minorities.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1:
Letter d:
CDs with language courses in the languages of the national minorities, video works
and theater productions, for example, are funded from the federal promotional budget
for the national minorities.
Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Czech language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs from the Czech Republic can be received in Vienna without any restrictions.
The following additional comments need to be made in connection with the media
situation of the Czech population in Vienna. In keeping with § 3 (7) of the ORF Act, the

- 153 -

ORF has been broadcasting middle-wave programs (1476 kHz) in Czech on a regular
basis from the Bisamberg transmission station.
In the program slot between 19.05 and 19.30 h Radio Drát’ák is broadcast from
Monday to Wednesday. This weekly magazine in Czech focuses on events within the
Czech national minority in Vienna. The topics of the broadcasts range from politics to
culture, as well as to sports. The mother-tongue programs offer the national minority a
platform for an intensive exchange of information.
On Friday (between 19.05 and 19.30 h) a Czech youth program

is broadcast by

Radio 1476 (“Zvidavýmikrofon”). This youth magazine of the Czech population in
Vienna deals with all topics of major city. In the bilingual programs (Czech and
German) language is a dramaturgical tool that is applied conscientiously. The pupils of
the Komensky upper-level secondary school and of the American International School
in Vienna prepare the magazine.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
As part of the activities to promote the national minorities, various cultural activities and
facilities that deal with cultivating the Czech language receive promotional funding. An
important criterion for being allocated promotional funding for the national minorities is
cultivating the language of the national minorities. All types of cultural facilities and
acitivities, as they are listed in Article 12 (1) of the Charter, are eligible for receiving
promotional funding. In 2007, 11 associations of the national minority, as well as one
church facility located in Vienna received EUR 451,409.00 from the budget of the
Federal Chancellery to promote the national minorities. The largest amount, i.e. EUR
362,555.00, was allocated to the Komensky School Association. The school
association offers a bilingual educational path from the nursery-school level to the
school-leaving examination. The teachers employed by the Komensky School
Association are also paid by the State. The school association also looks after
comprehensive archived materials and a large library and makes available its premises
for theater performances and other events of the entire national minority. Three Czechlanguage or bilingual periodicals also receive promotional funding. They are: Česká a
- 154 -

slovenská Videň dnes, Kulturní klub and Videňské svobodné listy The Catholic Mission
received EUR 17,000.00 in 2007 for its work with young people in the Czech language
or in Czech and German. In addition to the work going on the course of the whole year,
the Catholic Mission also organizes a holiday camp in Czech and/or German and
Czech for the Czech population. The association newsletter was put on electronic
media and can be accessed at www.rozhledy.at. The Catholic Mission maintains an
altogether close cooperation with the Komensky school. The Jirásek Library
Association received EUR 2,300.00 for renting its library premises. Five Sokol
gymnastic clubs received promotional funding in 2007, as the Sokol movement has a
standing among the national minority that enhances its tradition and identity. One of
the clubs organizes sports and language weeks for children and juveniles in the Czech
Republic. The Czech-Austrian Contact Forum arranges Czech performances in
Austria. The amateur theater group “Vlastenecka omladina“ stages two own
productions in the Czech language every year.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example). Promotional funding by
the Austrian Foreign Ministry may be received under the heading of “cultural activities
abroad”. The Austrian embassy in Prague supported the following projects, for
example, with this funding:
6 April 2001: Lecture by Ilona Slawinski, Vienna: “Beitrag der tschechischen
Wisssenschaftler und Künstler für Wien und Österreich” (The Contribution of Czech
Scientists and Artists to Vienna and Austia).
22 November 2005: Book presentation by Marie Brandeis: “Wir kamen von anderswo”
(We came from some place else)
8 November 2006: Presentation by Helena Basler(ová): “Die Wiener Tschechen” (The
Czech Population of Vienna)

- 155 -

Article 14, letter b (Trans-frontier exchanges):
From September 2002 to December 2004 the Komensky School Association carried
out the project “Forum bilinguale” with co-financing from the budget for promoting the
national minorities. It received EUR 200,000.00 from EFRE funds. The Czech partner
was a bilingual grammar school in Znaim/Znojmo. The goal of this project was to set
up a network that serves to preserve and promote Czech culture on the basis of sound
skills in the Czech and German languages. This objective is to be obtained, inter alia,
by organizing sports competitions, arranging contacts for companies for cooperation
projects or by teaching motivation and job strategies.
Since 1997/98 the pilot school project “European middle school” has been pursued in
Vienna. This school follows the curriculum for the first four grades of upper-level
secondary schools. However, it also takes account of Czech, Hungarian and Slovak
curricula. The idea is to put together classes in which one half of the pupils has
German as its mother tongue, and the other half has Czech, Hungarian or Slovak as
its mother tongue. To this end, pupils from the neighboring countries, as well as
Austrian pupils with the respective mother tongues may be admitted. In addition to
Austrian teachers, teachers from the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia are also
assigned to class-room teaching.
The events of the Czech-Slovak/Austrian Contact Forum, as well as the sports and
language weeks in the Czech Republic must also be mentioned in this context. Time
and again, the Culture Club of Czechs and Slovaks in Vienna organizes events to
which representatives of the Czech Republic are also invited. In the year 2006, for
example, this event was “Die Wiener Tschechen 1945 – 2005” (The Czech Population
in Vienna 1945 – 2005).

- 156 -

III.5. The Slovak Language in the Federal Province of Vienna:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a iv:
12 children with Slovak as their mother tongue also attend the nursery school of the
Komensky school. This activity is also funded from the federal budget for promoting
the national minorities.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1
Letter d:
CDs with language courses in the languages of the national minorities, video works
and theater productions, for example, are funded from the federal promotional budget
for the national minorities.
Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Slovak language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs from Slovakia can be received in Vienna without any restrictions.
The following additional comments need to be made in connection with the media
situation of the Slovak population in Vienna. In keeping with § 3 (7) of the ORF Act, the
- 157 -

ORF has been middle-wave broadcasting programs (1476 kHz) in the Slovak language
on a regular basis from the Bisamberg transmission station.
On Tuesdays and Thursdays (alternating) “Radio Dia: Ton” and “Radio Spŏngia” are
broadcast on Radio 1476. This is a program for young people in the Slovak language.
Topics of the Slovak population are in the foreground, but they also refer to issues of
cultural identity, mother tongue and European integration. The program of the youth
broadcast is prepared by the pupils of the Komensky School. The media training,
which was set up at the school in cooperation with the Federal Ministry for Education,
Arts and Culture, provides the necessary know-how and serves as a workshop for
productions.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
As part of the activities to promote the national minorities, various cultural activities and
facilities that deal with cultivating the Slovak language receive promotional funding. All
types of cultural facilities and acitivities, as they are listed in Article 12 (1) of the
Charter, are eligible for receiving promotional funding. In 2007, 3 associations of the
national minority located in Vienna received EUR 111,155.00 from the budget of the
Federal Chancellery to promote the national minorities (2 of these of the Slovak
national minority, 1 of the Czech national minority). The largest amount, i.e. EUR
60,500.00, was used by the Austrian-Slovak Cultural Association for the following
purposes:
-

rent costs, operating expenses, insurance for the association premises, staff
expenses, and office overhead costs
publication of POHLÁDY, the Slovak-language association newsletter
for organizing Slovak-language theater performances in Vienna
for organizing a cultural program that is specific of the national minority and/or in
the Slovak language
for the children’s folk dance group, conducted in Slovak or bilingually
for organizing screenings of Slovak-language films, followed by discussions

- 158 -

SOVA, the Slovak School Association, received EUR 11,300.00 for the following
budget items:
for staff, office expenses
fof the Internet presentation of the association at www.slovaci.at
for buying literature, video and sound carriers specifically for the national minority
for the parent-children group (project title: “promoting the Slovak language in small

for teaching Slovak to children
for the literature project “Kinder entdecken die slowakische Literatur” (Children
Discover Slovak Literature)
for organizing programs for juveniles in the Slovak language or specifically for the
national minority
music lessons in Czech or bilingually
The Komensky School Association received EUR 39,355.00 for staff expenses for one
Slovak-language day-nursery teacher, as well as for one Slovak or two bilingual
nursery-school teachers, as Slovak children are also looked after at the Komensky
School.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example). Promotional funding by
the Austrian Foreign Ministry may be received under the heading of “cultural activities
abroad”.
Article 14 (Trans-frontier exchanges):
Letter b:
The contacts of the organizations of the Slovak national minority comprise, for
example, the organization of a holiday camp in Slovakia by the cultural association or
that Slovak nationals participate in various association projects. Time and again, artists
from Slovakia are invited to cultural events.

- 159 -

The project CentroLING of the European Office of the School Inspectorate for Vienna
should also be mentioned here, in the course of which native speakers from Slovakia,
inter alia, teach at schools in Vienna. This project, which received the European Seal
for innovative language projects in 2007, also published a text book for the Slovak
language for pupils between 13 and 18 years of age.

III.6. The Romany Language in the Federal Province of Burgenland:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1
Letter f iii:
Several organizations of the national minority of the Roma offer courses in Romany as
part of the adult-education and continuing-education program and received funding
from the budget available for promoting the national minorities.
Moreover, it was decided in October 2005 to use remaining funds from the
Reconciliation Fund in the amount of EUR 1.1 million (spread out over ten years) for
the Roma national minority and to earmark these funds for educational activities and
working with juveniles of the Roma population. As a result, the money was put in the
Roma Fund, from which EUR 90,000.00 may be spent every year for educational
projects with pupils, juveniles and adults of the national minority of the Roma. Among
other items, the funds are used for the RomBus of “Romaservice”, an association, as
well as for the school bus of the association “Roma Oberwart”. An amount of EUR
200,000.00 has been earmarked for research projects. The Roma Fund supports the
members of the national minority throughout Austria.
The Minorities’ Schools Act for Burgenland of 1994 (Federal Law Gazette No.
641/1994), as well as the relevant implementing laws in Burgenland provide that there
is a legal title to Romany classes if there is demand for them.
As the Romany language became a written language only very late, this right can only
be implemented in steps. The language of the Burgenland Roma is a language with an
oral tradition which thus had not been recorded in writing. It was only about ten years
- 160 -

go that as part of a scientific Romany project by dedicated linguists, who also work at
the Institute of Philology of the University of Graz, in cooperation with representatives
of the Roma Association at Oberwart, work was begun to establish a written language
and to codify it. In the course of the Romany project of the University of Graz, the main
varieties of the Romany language spoken in Austria were compiled and processed on
a scientific basis. As a result of this work, newspapers of Roma associations can now
be published in two languages, and bilingual collections of Roma stories and teaching
games were produced, and classes taught in Romany were set up at Oberwart and
Unterwart, for which curricula and teaching materials had to be produced. Ongoing
scientific support is required for the production and publication of bilingual association
newspapers and for the preparation of the Romany classes.
In the meantime, first teaching materials have been completed and put to use.
However, there is still not a sufficient volume of materials available which would allow
studies in the Romany language. As a result, no courses can be offered to train
teachers at a pedagogical university. “Native speakers” are therefore used on a
substitute basis for the Romany classes, who are given a basic pedagogical training.
The “RomBus” project of the association Roma Service is responsible for supporting
educational activities for Roma children on a mobile basis. It also serves to provide
public relations work.

Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs can be received in Burgenland without any restrictions.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
As part of the activities to promote the national minorities, various cultural activities and
facilities that deal with cultivating the Romany language receive promotional funding.
An important criterion for receiving promotional funding for the national minorities is to
cultivate the language of the national minority. All types of cultural facilities and
acitivities, as they are listed in Article 12 (1) of the Charter, are eligible for receiving
promotional funding. In 2007, two associations of the national minority located in
Burgenalnd received EUR 154,400.00 from the budget of the Federal Chancellery for
promoting the national minorities. The largest part of this amount, i.e. EUR 114,000.00,
was allocated to the association Roma Service for the following projects:
-

for staff expenses and office overhead costs
for buying literature, video and audio carriers that are specific of the national
minority
for producing teaching material for teaching Romany
for publishing dROMa, the newspaper in Romany and German
for publishing Mri Nevi Mini Multi, the children’s newspaper in Romany
for operating “RomBus“ (mobile teaching assistance)
for an interview project with members of the national minority of the Roma

“Roma – Verein zur Förderung von Roma“ (Association to Promote the Roma)
received EUR 39,500.00 from the budget of the Federal Chancellery to promote the
national minorities for the following purposes:
-

office expenses
staff expenses for teaching-assistance coaches
for publishing “Romani patrin”, the newspaper in Romany or two languages
- 163 -

The desk for the ethnic groups of the Eisenstadt diocese received EUR 900.00 for
organizing the traditional Roma pilgrimage comprising a cultural program
activities for children and juveniles
In this context, one should mention, in particular, the codification and teaching of the
Romany language which became possible with funding from the budget for the
national minorities. As a result, it was possible to put the language that had previously
been handed over only in oral form into a written form, so that the cultural expressions
of this national minority can also be disseminated in written form (e.g. publishing
bilingual association newsletters, teaching materials in Romany, partly also in
electronic form, a children’s newspaper in the Romany language and stories passed
on in oral form). Philologists have been conducting this Romany project since 1993,
together with representatives of the national minority. In addition to the scientific work,
to publishing books, which disseminate the stories and tales of the different Roma
groups both in their language and in German, the project also relates to supporting the
organizations of the national minorities in publishing newspapers and teaching
materials in Romany and German. In addition, data bases are setup and managed, i.e.
ROMBASE (at http://romani.uni-graz.at/rombase/), which provides information on the
culture and history of the Roma, ROMLEX (http://romani.kfunigraz.ac.at/romlex/),
which

is

a

base,

and

ROMANE

LILA

(http://www-gewi.uni-

graz.at/romani/lila/index.en.html), which contains a bibliography. In the year 2007, the
Romany project received EUR 58,500.00 from the budget available to promote the
national minorities.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example). The Austrian embassy
and the Cultural Forum Prague in the Czech Republic, for example, supported the

Moreover, a concert by Harri Stojka on 25 June 2006 in Pressburg/Bratislava was
supported.
Article 14, letter b (Trans-frontier exchanges):
With the funding to promote the organizations of the national minorities among the
national minority of the Roma, projects of trans-frontier cooperation are being
facilitated time and again. To give but one example, one should mention the
cooperation, begun in June 2007, between the adult education college of the
Burgenland Croatians, the association Roma Service and the Romani Union at Murska
Sobota (Slovenia). The association Roma Service, which publishes “Mri nevi
MiniMulti”, the children’s newspaper in Burgenland Romany (which in turn is based on
“Moj novi minimulti”, the newspaper published in the Burgenland-Croatian language by
the adult education college of the Burgenland Croats), makes available the material
produced by the Romani Union in Slovenia which it translates into Prekmurski
Romany.

III.7. The Slovene Language in the Federal Province of Styria:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a iv:
According to the 2004 Language Census, only 4 children in the district of Bad
Radkersburg and eight children in the district of Leibnitz, who are growing up
bilingually (German and Slovene) went to nursery schools of their districts in the
2004/2005 nursery-school year. On account of the lack of demand, there are therefore
no nursery-schools that are specifically run in the two languages and/or groups to
which a mother-tongue Slovene-speaking nursery-school teacher would be assigned in
addition to a German-speaking nursery-school teacher.
There is, however, a partnership between the municipal nursery school at Bad
Radkersburg and the nursery school of Gomja Radgona (Sovenia). In the course of
this partnership, joint projects are being carried out and/or small groups from one
nursery school regularly spend some time in the respectively other nursery school.
Time and again, the Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy at Mureck
organizes projects with the nursery school at Apače/Abstall. The students are also
offered to study Slovene as an optional subject.
It would however, be possible at any time to organize pre-school education also in the
languages of the national minority with funding for private nursery-school groups,
available from the budget for promoting the national minorities.
Letter e iii:
On account of the universities’ autonomy, as stipulated by law, state intervention into
the study courses offered by the universities is only possible to a limited extent. In fact,
though Slovene is being offered as a study course at the following Austrian
universities:
-

University of Vienna, Institute for Slavic Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Slavic Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Theoretical and Applied Translation Sciences

-

University of Innsbruck, Institute for Slavic Studies
- 166 -

-

University of Klagenfurt, Institute for Slavic Studies

Letter f iii:
Slovene is taught a various adult-education colleges, as well as by the organizations of
the national minority. These programs are also promoted from the public funds. For
example, language course are organized by the “Article VII Cultural Association”
(Pavel House), the association “Österreichisch-Slowenische Freundschaft”, the
regional “Zukunfstwerkstatt” (Future Workshop) at Ehrenhausen, by “Treffpunkt
Srpache” (Meeting Point Languages) at the University of Graz (additional program
offers), by Urania, WIFI (Institute for Economic Promotion) and the “Bildungshaus
Retzhof” near Leibnitz.
Slovene is offered as an optional exercise at various primary and lower-level
secondary schools, as well as at one polytechnic school. Approximately 260 pupils
attended these courses.
The “Article VII Cultural Association” is engaged in the continuing training of Slovene
teachers and informs them about seminars and new text books. In 2006 it organized a
first meeting of teachers at the Pavel House so that Slovene teachers can also get to
know each other and discuss opinions, problems and ideas. The organization was
supported by the pedagogy coach for the Slovene teachers for the Raab area/Porabje,
but also by Carinthian-Slovene pedagogues.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1
Letter d:
CDs with language courses in the languages of the national minorities, video works
and theater productions, for example, are funded from the federal promotional budget
for the national minorities.
Letter e i:
“Novice”, the weekly newspaper published in Slovene, receives press-promotion
funding and can also be obtained in Styria. In addition, the “Artikel-VII-Kulturverein für
Steiermark“ (Article VII Cultural Association for Styria) publishes “Signal”, a
- 167 -

comprehensive information journal, which receives funding from the budget available
to promote the national minorities.
Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Slovene language.
Paragraph 2:
The freedom of communication is fully guaranteed in Austria by the constitution. In this
context, one should mention Article 10 of the Human Rights Convention, which has
constitutional ranking in Austria, Article 13 (1) of the Basic State Law on the General
Rights of Citizens, Imperial Law Gazette No. 142/1867, the decision of the Provisional
National Assembly of 1918 on the abolition of censorship, State Law Gazette No.
3/1918, as well as the federal constitutional law on ensuring the independence of
broadcasting, Federal Law Gazette No. 396/1974. Cable television and satellite
programs can be received in Styria without any restrictions.
It should also be mentioned that the ORF has been broadcasting its radio and
television programs also via satellite. A receiver, including an ORF SmartCard, is
necessary in order to be able to receive these programs. Radio and television program
consumers can thus receive not only the regional programs of their own region but
also of the other federal provinces. This means that programs broadcast in Carinthia
for the Slovene national minority can also be received in Styria. This option to receive
programs via satellite was chosen deliberately as a measure to comply with the need
to promote the national minorities.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letters a and d:
As part of the activities to promote the national minorities, cultural activities that deal
with cultivating the Slovene language receive promotional funding. One should
mention the support given to a cultural center located in southern Styria, which stages
cultural events (readings, exhibitions, etc., that are also supported from the budget
- 168 -

available for the national minorities) on a regular basis. The “Artikel VII-Kulturverein”,
which operates this cultural center, received EUR 58,200.00 in 2007 from the budget
available for promoting the national minorities, i.e. for:
-

staff expenses
operating costs for the Pavel House
publishing “Signal”, a bilingual journal in Slovene and German

The federal province of Styria supported the “Article VII Cultural Association” with a
total amount of EUR 12,000.00 in 2006 and of EUR 10,000.00 in 2007.
The Slovene Student Club in Graz received EUR 5,000.00 for the following program
items:
for publishing “Informator”, the Slovene or bilingual club newspaper
the festival “Slovenski Dnevi“ – “Slovenian Days“
for organization a cultural program in Slovene or two languages
Paragraph 2:
The allocation of funding to promote the national minorities does not depend on
whether the activity or institution to be promoted is located in the autochthonous
settlement area of the national minority or not.
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities (see also the
activities mentioned in connection with Article 14, for example). The Austrian embassy
and Cultural Forum Laibach/Ljubljana reported that in the year 2007 it promoted a
concert of the Pavel Choir (Article VII Cultural Association) in the course of the “Weeks
of Trans-Frontier Cooperation”.
Article 13 (Economic and social life):
Paragraph 1 letter d:
This provision is implemented, first and foremost, by the ban on discriminating against
speakers of minority languages (for details see the comments on Article 7 (2)), as well
as by Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, which has constitutional ranking
and guarantees the right to use any language in private and business transactions.

- 169 -

Article 14 letter b (Trans-frontier exchanges):
Letter b:
ARGE Alpen-Adria plays a special role in maintaining trans-frontier exchanges. The
activities and stimuli from ARGE Alpen-Adria were an important contribution for
creating more awareness and giving more intensive consideration to minority issues in
Central Europe. By mutually learning about possible solutions it was possible to
contribute towards mitigating conflicts in the member regions. It is generally seen to be
a positive effect of the events organized by ARGE Alpen-Adria to date that members of
the various minorities were given an opportunity to get into direct contacts with each
other, as well as to get to know each other in course of the cultural activities. A direct
cooperation between the regional authorities results already from the fact that the
federal province of Styria is a member of ARGE Alpen-Adria, and as such it is
represented by its provincial governor.
As a specific example of trans-frontier cooperation, one should mention the partnership
between the municipal nursery school at Bad Radkersburg and the nursery school at
Gomja Radgona (Slovenia). Joint projects are carried in the course of this partnership
and/or small groups of the nursery schools regularly spend some time in the
respectively other nursery school. There is one further school partnership between the
lower-level secondary school at Arnfels and the OŠ Muta and the OŠ Sentilj. One
lower-level secondary school at Leibnitz is looking for a Slovenian partner school.

III.8. The Hungarian Language in the Federal Province of Vienna:
Article 8 (Education):
Paragraph 1
Letter a iv:
One should report about the most recent development, namely that since 1 October
2007 a (to date) small group of Hungarian children attend the nursery school of the
Komensky School Association. For the time being, it continues to be integrated into a
bilingual group (Czech, German). During the startup phase, a Hungarian- and Germanspeaking nursery-school teacher takes care of four children. One may expect a
considerable increase in the number of children. As of the fall of 2008, the Hungarian
- 170 -

nursery-school group will be run independently and offer room for more children – as
soon as the building facilities have been adapted.
This Hungarian children’s group is supported from the budget available for promoting
the national minorities.
In addition, once a week the “Zentralverband ungarischer Organisationen in
Österreich“ (Central Association of Hungarian Associations in Austria) teaches children
with Hungarian as their mother tongue in the Hungarian language and culture (name of
the project: “Hungarian Nursery School”). The Hungarian School Association in Vienna
also teaches weekly classes in the Hungarian language and culture in the course of
the “Honismeret” project, inter alia, to pre-school children.
Letter e iii:
On account of the universities’ autonomy, which is stipulated by law, state intervention
into the study courses offered by universities is possible only to a limited extent. In fact,
though, Hungarian is being offered as a study course at the following Austrian
universities:
-

University of Vienna, Institute for Finno-Ugric Studies

-

University of Vienna, Institute for Translator and Interpreter Training

-

Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, Institute for Slavic
Studies

-

University of Graz, Institute for Theoretical and Applied Translation Sciences

At the Vienna University of Economic and Business Administration Hungarian is taught
as one of the optional subjects. Hungarian is also taught at the University of Vienna,
i.e. as part of the diploma course in Slavic studies, as the bachelor’s degree course in
translation and interpreting, to obtain a teaching qualification, as well as one of the
languages offered by the Language Center of the University of Vienna. The University
of Vienna also offers a broad range of study courses in connection with the languages
of the national minorities.
At the University of Applied Science for International Relations in Eisenstadt, learning
one language of an Eastern-European country is compulsory. Hungarian is one of the

- 171 -

languages that can be studied. The University of Applied Science at Pinkafeld offers
Hungarian as a second living foreign language.
Letter f iii:
Various organizations of the national minority offer courses in Hungarian, which also
receive funding from the federal budget available to promote the national minorities.
The Hungarian School Association, set up in Vienna in 1921, regards it as its primary
task to communicate the language of the Hungarian national minority by way of
language courses.
Article 11 (Media):
Paragraph 1
Letter d:
CDs with language courses in the languages of the national minorities, video works
and theater productions, for example, are funded from the federal promotional budget
for the national minorities.
Letter e i:
“Bécsi Napló”, which is published periodically in the Hungarian language, is promoted
from the budget available for the national minorities.
Letter f ii:
In addition to the funding available for national minorities, as mentioned in letter d,
general support schemes such as promotional activities for the arts are also available
for audio-visual productions in the Hungarian language.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities):
Paragraph 1:
Letter a and d:
As part of the promotional funding given to the national minorities, the organizations of
the Hungarian national minority headquartered in Vienna, which cover many of the
areas of activities listed in paragraph 1, are supported by way of promotional funding.
In concrete terms, 13 associations of the Hungarian national minority and three church
facilities headquartered in Vienna received funding in a total amount of EUR
- 172 -

185,120.00 in the year 2007. The Central Association of Hungarian Associations and

Further organizations received smaller amounts. In addition, the Komensky School
Association received EUR 7,504.00 for its Hungarian-language nursery-school
teacher.
Paragraph 2:
The allocation of funding from the budget available for the national minorities does not
depend on whether the activity or facility to be promoted is located in the
autochthonous settlement area of a national minority. Accordingly, in 2007 two
organizations in Upper Austria received funding for the national minorities in the
amount of EUR 4,300.00, as well as one organization in Salzburg (EUR 530.00), two
organizations in Styria (EUR 3,600.00) and two organizations in Tyrol (EUR 2,600.00).
Paragraph 3:
When pursuing its cultural policy abroad, Austria makes every effort to present
Austria’s linguistic diversity, as it is also reflected in its national minorities.
Article 13 (Economic and social life):
Paragraph 1, letter d:
This provision is implemented, first and foremost, by the ban on discriminating against
speakers of minority languages (for details see the comments on Article 7 (2)), as well
as by Article 66 (3) of the State Treaty of St. Germain, which has constitutional ranking
and guarantees the right to use any language in private and business transactions.
Occasionally, the promotional funding may act as an incentive for promoting the use of
- 175 -

the Hungarian language in business and social life. One can mention as one example
the Yearbook of the Economic Interest Group of Hungarians in Austria – the KALAKA
Club: In addition to a calendar section, the yearbook contains several articles, as well
as a list of Hungarian entrepreneurs in Vienna and Burgenland.
Article 14, letter b (Trans-frontier exchanges):
A growing number of projects of trans-frontier cooperation is facilitated by promoting
the organizations of the national minorities among the Hungarian national minority. In
particular, artists and scientists from Hungary, but also from Transylvania and other
regions with a Hungarian minority participate in the events of Hungarians in Vienna,
give lectures or teach folk dancing and folk music. One should also mention the
CentroLING project of the Euorpean Office of the School Inspectorate for Vienna, in
the course of which native speakers from Hungary, inter alia, teach at schools in
Vienna.
Since 1997/1998, the pilot school project “European middle schools” has been pursued
in Vienna. This school is run in keeping with the curriculum of the first to fourth grades
of an upper-level secondary school; however, it takes account of Czech, Hungarian
and Slovak curricula. The idea is that half of the classes should consist of pupils with
German as a mother tongue, and the other half should be pupils with Czech,
Hungarian or Slovak as their mother tongue. In this context, both pupils from the
neighboring countries and Austrian pupils with the respective mother tongue may be
admitted. In addition to Austrian teachers, teachers from the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Slovakia are also assigned to the project.

All three events received financial funding from Urad Vlade RS za Slovence v zamejstvu.
Moreover, individual nursery schools (represented in our working party) have lively transfrontier contacts which they maintain on an autonomous basis.

Slovene School Asociation, Klagenfurt
The staff members of the institutions of the Slovene School Association (3 nursery schools and
the Mladinski dom youth center) try to create language situations, beyond the working
program, in which the Slovene language can be additionally promoted. We achieve this goal
by cooperating with institutions in Slovenia, which in turn are looking for partners beyond
country borders for their projects. Below are some examples for these activities:
a) During the 2006/2007 school year the Mladinski dom center was a partner in the Leonardo
da Vinci project of “Srednja vzgojiteljska šola in gimnazija v Ljubljani” (middle school for
teachers and grammar school in Ljubljana). In the course of this project, a total of 19 pupils of
that middle school were each guests of the youth center for one month and worked, at the
same time, as trainees at the bilingual nursery school “Sonce”. Further partners of the project
were the Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy in Klagenfurt, Delovna
skupnost privatnih dvo- in večjezičnih vrtcev / Arge zwei- und mehrsprachiger Kindergärten
(Working Party of Bilingual and Multi-Lingual Nursery Schools) and the parent-teacher
association of the Federal Training Institute for Nursery-School Pedagogy in Klagenfurt.

- 194 -

b) Every year, a continuing training seminar for the faculty of teachers of the youth center
in Slovenia. This three-day seminar, which is held every year shortly after the start of a new
school year (and has been held 38 times so far), is also attended by teachers from Trieste/Trst
und Gorizia/Gorical. On that occasion, pedagogical issues are discussed in Slovene, and
lectures are given by renowned Slovene psychologists and pedagogues. The seminar is
financed by “Zavod RS za šolstvo in šport« (Educational Authority of the Republic of Slovenia).
c) We also have lively contacts with the aforementioned “Srednja vzgojiteljska šola in
gimnazija v Ljubljani” in the field of theater for children. Every year, one to two theater
performances by pupils of this school are presented to the children of the “Sonce” nursery
school and the ABCČ day nursery (which is also located at the youth center) at the Mladinski
dom youth center in the course of their excursions. These contacts have been maintained for
more than two decades.
The two partners finance the costs of these meetings.
d) On the level of pupils’ centers, the Mladinski dom youth center has maintained lively
contacts with “Dijaški dom Lizike Jančar« (pupils’ center) in Maribor for 20 years. During the
2005/2006 school year, these contacts, which previously consisted of annual visits, were
intensified with the project “Skriti zaklad“ (The Hidden Treasure). In this context, our young
people from the Mladinski dom youth center organized five joint events and excursions with the
juveniles of the Slovene national minority in Hungary and pupils from Maribor:
12.01.2006: event in Maribor with the title: “Festival der Völker” (Festival of the Peoples)
22.03.2006: excursion to southern Hungary to the Slovene national minority
05.04.2006: visit of the pupils from Maribor and southern Hungary to Carinthia
24.04.2006: live broadcast on Radio Slovenija in the youth series “Gymnasium”
16.05.2006: closing event of the project in Maribor (photo exhibition about the project,
discussions evaluating the project and city sightseeing). The project was financed by the
Ministry of Education of the Republic of Slovenia.
e) One further example for trans-frontier cooperation is “Filmkreis - Filmski krožek - Mladinski
dom”. In addition to ongoing work throughout the school year together with juveniles from
Slovenia and Italy, film workshops were organized from 04.09. - 07.09. 2003 at Piran (SLO),
from 28/06 to 01/07/2004 at Portorož (SLO), from 26/06 to 01/07/2005, from 29/6 to 29/6/2006
and from 19/06 to 21/06/2007 in Klagenfurt. This activity was financed as a youth project by
Slowenischer Kulturverband (Slovene Cultural Association) and from funding for the promotion
of the national minorities of the Republic of Slovenia.

- 195 -

f) Every year, a special “Training Day of the Youth Center” is held at the youth center, in the
course of which lectures and workshops are organized for the pedagogical staff, the pupils of
the Mladinski dom youth center and for the parents. These are held and moderated by
renowned pedagogues, experts in communication or psychologists from Slovenia. This event
is also supported by the Office for the National Minorities, set up with the Office of the
Government of the Federal Province of Carinthia.
g) Here I will give two examples – representative for many others – for the occasional events
and contacts on the level of the nursery schools. The children of the nursery school “Pika”
were guests of the nursery school “Črnuče” on 15 June 2007, and the staff members of the
nursery school “Logatec” were guests of the nursery school “Pika“ and of the Working Party for
Private Bilingual and Multi-Lingual Nursery Schools on 30 October 2007. An exchange of
experience and information was held on these occasions, which related to the languageteaching concept of private bilingual and multi-lingual nursery schools.

Kralj Matjaž
We, representing the association “OK Petzenmarathon Kralj Matjaž” no longer organize any
trans-frontier events. We held our last event on 2006. We continue, though, to be in contact
with our neighbors in Slovenia, by way of jointly attending running events in Slovenia and
Austria.

Peter Marković
In reaction to your circular letter of 5/11/2007 I would like to inform you that our cultural
association only has modest contacts to the cultural association at Bohinj in Slovenia. So far,
three groups from Bohinj were guests at our events, at present we are “negotiating” an
invitation for our youth group Didldumdaj to Bohinj, which is under considerable time
constraints.

Glasbena Šola - Kärntner Musikschule (Carinthian Music School)
Glasbena šola organizes joint concerts every year by way of cooperating with music schools in
Slovenia.
At 2-year intervals jointly organized concerts are held with our music school at the following
places in Slovenia:

Bäuerliche Bildungsgemeinschaft Südkärnten – KIS (Farmers’ Educational
Cooperation)
“Kmečka

izobraževalna

skupnost”

(KIS)/

Bäuerliche

Bildungsgemeinschaft

(Farmers’

Educational Cooperation) was founded in 1988 and has its offices at the education center of
Sodalitas at Tainach. It is responsible for carrying out educational programs for the rural
population in southern Carinthia. In this context, the use of the Slovene language is of major
importance, as language skills in the language of the neighboring country are gaining
increasingly in importance. Very often, it is also one of the prerequisites for operating
successfully in this region. In southern Carinthia, language competences in Slovene are one of
the resources which were previously given too little, if any, attention.
With its trans-frontier activities in the framework of the project “Bildungskooperation in der
Landwirtschaft”

(Educational

Cooperation

in

Agriculture

–

BIKOLA/InterregIIIA),

KIS

contributes towards getting to know each other and removing prejudices. The goal of these
efforts is to strengthen the economy of the region and to enhance the presence of the Slovene
language as an obvious matter of course. Lectures, seminars, courses, conferences and
special excursions, inter alia, are organized in order to reach this goal.
After the Interreg IIIA project was approved, it has been possible to staff the KIS office on a
permanent basis. The BIKOLA project was submitted by the LFI. KIS has a contractual
relationship to Slovenia concerning the cooperation. The project receives 80% EU funding.
Vida Obid, employed by the association KIS, is responsible for the organizational work of the
project.
During the period January 2005 to November 2007 it was possible for 3,000 farmers in the
region of southern Carinthia to take part in the educational events organized by KIS.

- 197 -

Activities:
The focus of KIS activities during the period under review was in the field of continuing training,
in order to assist the farming enterprises in reaching their economic objectives. For this
purpose, a survey was conducted concerning the structure of the member enterprises in order
to adapt the program even more to the interests of the undertakings. In this context, improving
Slovene language skills plays an important role, enabling farmers in southern Carinthia to
communicate and to cooperate across borders. Every year, KIS offers farmers courses in
Slovene so that they can acquire and/or expand their language skills. These courses meet with
lively interest. Specific technical expressions, in particular, are practiced, using special
glossaries. Their production was promoted two years ago by the Federal Chancellery. The
acquired skills are tested in the course of technical excursions.
As part of the Interreg IIIA project, KIS organizes events such as lectures, language courses,
technical excursions, seminars, meetings, talks with partner organizations and responsible
politicians and civil servants in Slovenia and Austria in order to reach the project targets.
Together with Slovene senior civil servants, KIS representatives organized a visit of the
Minister of Agriculture (2005) and the responsible civil servants in Carinthia and initiated talks
with the respective political and technical representatives and civil servants. Representatives
of KIS took part in trans-frontier projects and events in visible functions, and they established
contacts between agricultural enterprises in Carinthia and Slovenia. They also actively
attended agricultural fairs and exhibitions on both sides of the border.
Representatives of KIS took part in the federal farmers’ conferences and held talks on transfrontier cooperation among rural women. As a result, KIS representatives were invited to the
meeting of farmers’ women at Slovenjgradec/SLO. As a follow-up to these contacts, a regional
meeting of rural women took place at Tainach in November 2005, which specifically dealt with
insurance and health issues. This ongoing cooperation led to a first trans-frontier bread award
in 2007, organized by the Chamber of Agriculture of Carinthia. Staff members of our
association made a major contribution to this event, also with their language competences.
Moreover, in November 2007 the symposium “Južna Koroška – perspektive za naše
podeželje/Südkärnten – Perspektiven für den ländlichen Raum“ (Southern Carinthia –
Perspectives for the Rural Regions) was held at Tainach, which was particularly intended for
rural women on both sides of the border. In the course of the symposium the
“Kmetice/Bäuerinnen 2008“ farmers’ calendar was presented, which comprises the portraits of
12 female farmers and 12 calendar stories. It was possible to produce the calendar with
funding from the Federal Chancellery for the promotion of the national minorities.

- 198 -

The lectures on tax and insurance issues in agriculture also meet with great interest, given by
experts from Slovenia and Carinthia, as well as the individual advice given to farmers in these
matters. Trans-frontier continuing training events for farmers were offered together with
consultants at Prevalje. As part of the 2006/2007 program, events were organized on
renewable energy and on the problem of genetically adapted organisms. KIS was a partner in
2006 in the “e-Kenntnisse” (electronic knowledge) training sessions on farming estates. On the
basis of the records made by the KIS chairman, a data base in Slovene was produced for
biogenic farmers.
Every year KIS participates actively in the “Dobrote slovenskih kmetij“ competition (specialties
from Slovene farms) at Ptuj by motivating Carinthian farmers to participate in the event, by
collecting the produce and delivering it to the responsible bodies. Every year, farmers from
Carinthia receive several gold, silver and bronze medals. Representatives of the Carinthian
Chamber of Agriculture regularly attend the closing event (3 days). KIS participates in this
exhibition with an information stand. Excursions are organized on a regular basis to attend the
prize-awarding events in May.
KIS participated actively in producing the bilingual excursion guide “Katalog dobrih praks na
kmetijah. Vodnik za ekskurzije/Landwirtschaftliche Betriebe Kärnten – Slowenien“ (Agricultural
Enterprises in Carinthia and Slovenia) which was initiated by the Chamber of Agriculture at
Celje. The catalogue features 50 model estates in Slovenia and Austria and was presented in
2005. It is a useful book for both sides of the border, when organizing trans-frontier technical
excursions, which are another focus of our activities. Every year, several excursions are
organized to model estates on either side of the border. KIS staff members are responsible for
the technicalities of the excursions and assist with their language competences.
At the end of May and in early June the project “Jugend ohne Grenzen/Mladina brez
meja/Giovani senza confine“ (Youth without Borders) on the subject of “Agriculture in the EU”
was organized in cooperation with the bilingual commercial college in Klagenfurt. Schools from
Carinthia (Klagenfurt), Friuli (Udine), Slovenia (Maribor and Kranj) and from Croatia (Vis)
participated in this project. Altogether 40 pupils and 8 teachers dealt intensively with the
subject of agriculture. This cooperation has resulted in technical contacts with the agricultural
technical school “Biotheniški center Naklo“ which are maintained on a regular basis. In
November 2007, a first group of pupils from this school will work as trainees for a wide range
of agricultural activities with farmers in Carinthia for one week.
In addition, KIS also organized continuing-education lectures on issues such as building
sewage lines; it also organized courses on tree-pruning, soil testing, accounting practices and

- 199 -

completing forms for tax offices, producing fruit juices, distilling, caring for senior citizens, etc.
Since September 2006 the KIS project “AS (Aktivni v starost/Aktive SeniorInnen)” (Active
Senior Citizens) is offered at the municipality of Lundmannsdorf. Once a week (4 hours),
memory exercises in both languages are offered to senior citizens. At present, this is a pilot
project; it is planned to expand it and organize it in Carinthia and Slovenia, as soon as the
bilingual study material and teaching aids have been produced.

Konvent der Schulschwestern, St.Jakob im Rosental (Convent of the School
Sisters)
This secondary teaching institute for business occupations (Höhere Lehranstalt für
wirtschaftliche Berufe/Višja Šola St. Peter) carried out a number of trans-frontier projects and
activities with the following partner schools:
1. Istituto d`istruzione superiore
“Ingeborg Bachmann“
Via Vittorio Veneto 54
33018 Tarvisio / ITALY
Comenius project: Schule ohne Grenzen/scuola senza confini (School without borders) –
working on the culinary specialties and the cultural history of the “triangle of countries”
(Carinthia, Friuli, Slovenia).
The Comenius project was completed in the year 2003, but there are still occasional contacts
and activities.
2. Srednja gostinska šola Radovljica
Kranjska cesta 24

Moreover, there was a teacher-exchange program in the school years 2005/2006 and
2006/2007. A colleague from Radovljica worked part-time at St. Peter. During the 2007/2008
school year both schools (St. Peter und Radovljica) will perform at the three-day Carinthian
folklore fair in Klagenfurt. Both schools will submit an INTERREG project shortly that will deal
with expanding tourism in the “three-country triangle” (Carnthia, Slovenia, Friuli). This project is
primarily meant to encourage young people in Europe to visit the “three-country triangle”.

The activities include mutual visits and exchanges of opinion on the Austrian and Hungarian
school system, as well as annual German courses (during the last week of school) at St. Peter
for Hungarian pupils, with tours and excursions in Carinthia, Italy and Slovenia. The Hungarian
pupils are accommodated at the boarding school or in a hotel. The German course
(approximately 4 hours per day) are organized free of charge and held by a German teacher
from HLW St. Peter.
6. Bourne Grammar School

This contact was established in the year 1999. In the meantime, there are visits to St. Peter by
English pupils on an annual basis. Joint excursions are organized in the “three-country
triangle” (Austria, Slovenia, Italy). A parallel option is to organize individual exchanges during
the holiday season. The host families are always selected by the teachers in Austria and
England and recommended to pupils and parents. This is the most economical way for young
people to spend some time abroad.

The project “Wir alle sind die Welt“ (We all are the world) was implemented during the 1998/99
school year. The net earnings of the project (calendar for the year 2000) in the amount of ATS
35,000.00 were donated to the partner school. In October 1999 the African choir “Ba Cengelo“
visited St. Peter for three days (in the course of a tour through Slovenia, Austria, Germany,
England and Ireland).
During the 2002/2003 school year, the pupils of the HLW St. Peter participated in the project
“Wasser für Afrika” (Water for Africa). In August 2003 a group of pupils, teachers and parents
visited the partner school at Solvezi and handed USD 12,000.00 to Father Miha Drevenšek,
the contact person, to build a well in the remotest villages, as well as to assist the pupils in
Zambia.
During the 2007/08 school year, the 34th Mission Raffle is being organized at St. Peter by the
third-grade pupils.
N.B.: Of course, there are also contacts to other schools in Austria and abroad. However,
these are not as intensive at present.

8. Symposium »Matija Majar im tschechisch-slowenischen Kontext – Kulturelle Kontakte in der
Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft« (Matija Majar in the Czech-Slovene Context –
Cultural Contacts Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow) in Prague
On the occasion of the 110-year anniversary of the death of Matija Majar Ziljski, the Slovene
priest who was born in the Gail Valley in Carinthia in 1809 and died in Prague in 1982, a
symposium was held at the Charles’ University in Prague in 2002 about M. Majar’s political
and cultural activities in the 19th century. The symposium was organized by the Slovene
Cultural Institute Urban Jarnik (Slovenski narodopisni inštitut Urban Jarnik), the Slovene
Scientific Institute in Klagenfurt (Slovenski znanstveni inštitut), the Scientific Research Center
of the Slovenian Academy of Science and Arts in Ljubljana (Znanstvenoraziskovalni center
SAZU), the embassy of the Republic of Slovenia in Prague, the Philosophical Department of
Charles’ University (Ústav slavistických a východoevropských studií Filozofické fakulty UK
v Praze) and the Slavic Library of the National Library of the Czech Republic in Prague
(Slovanská knihovna při Národní knihovně ČR Praha).
In 2004 a volume with the presentations held at the symposium was published in the Slovene
and Czech languages with summaries in German.

The project was co-financed by the Federal Chancellery and the Austrian Institute for Eastern
and South-Eastern Europe in Ljubljana.
9. Project: Minority status of the Slovene population in Carinthia – A multi-perspective analysis
Project leader: Prof. Dr. Tom Priestly, Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies,
University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada
Period: 1999-2001
The Slovene Ethnological Institute Urban Jarnik accepted the organizational tasks in
connection with the field research work in the bilingual area in Carinthia, which were conducted
by Prof. Dr. Tom Priestly and his scientific assistants (students from the universities in Alberta,
Vienna, Klagenfurt, Graz and Ljubljana).
The project was funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada
and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and the Arts.
10. Financing
The trans-frontier projects of the Slovene Ethnological Institute Urban Jarnik are co-financed
as part of the basic funding and under project financing for the Institute.

Biro za slovensko narodno skupnost pri Koroški deželni vladi (Office of the National Minorities
of the Federal Province of Carnthia)

Croatian National Minority
Šara jesen
The association Šara jesen is not involved in any trans-frontier projects. The only contact with
Burgenland-Croats outside of Austria was a concert by DUO CORDEFIATO (SK) and the
performance of the folklore ensemble KOLO SLAVUJ, with individual members from Hungary
and Slovakia. However, some of the visitors also came from the neighboring countries. As this
association mainly implements projects with the municipality of Großwarasdorf, it is not

- 209 -

planned at present to have any direct cooperation with associations across the border.
However, there will always be occasional performances of groups from “abroad”.

KUGA – Kulturna zadruga – Kulturvereinigung (Cultural association)
Ever since it was founded 25 years ago, the cultural association KUGA has made efforts to
involve in its activities and priorities the Burgenland Croats across the border in Hungary,
separated by the Iron Curtain at that time, and later also in Slovakia.
Hungarian courses with native speakers from nearby Hungary have always been organized. In
recent years, an experiment in this connection was not only launched but actually carried out.
The novel feature was that a Burgenland-Croat teacher from Hungary who had only a very
limited knowledge of German gave classes in Hungarian. It would have been a total-immersion
course, if the Burgenland-Croatian course participants had not acted as interpreters, whenever
situations occurred in the course of the course that required more detailed explanations.
At KUGAforKids the same language coach is assigned to looking after the children from 7.30 h
until the actual start of the course at 10.00 h. In addition to using Croatian, she will also throw
in a few words of Hungarian, as if in a game.
The annual rock-pop workshop, which has also been organized for nearly twenty years and
which has been expanded in recent years to include Tamburica instruments, has led to many
new young bands being set up. It therefore can boast a most successful development. In fact,
the number of course participants is growing year by year at a still steady rate. Here, too, an
interesting observation can be made – one of the workshop leaders from the BurgenlandCroatian village of Hrvatski Jandrof in Slovakia has become one of the supporting pillars of the
workshop team, and visitors from Slovakia and nearby Hungary also come to attend the rockpop workshop of the KUGA every year. One must also underline, in connection with this
summer festival, that communicating musical knowledge is not the only focus, but that 90% of
the songs are Croatian, ranging from pop to folk songs, and that Burgenland-Croatian is the
language of communication during the workshop. This is a fact which does not stop juveniles
speaking only German to also participate in the workshop.
Three years ago, KUGA organized a trans-frontier series of events in the field of modern
music, as a partner of a Centrope project (EU, Interreg IIIA) with the WUK in Vienna. It
comprised rock concerts in Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. KUGA’s role
was to organize one concert each at Sopron and at KUGA, with rock bands from the
participating regions, which were thus given an opportunity to also present themselves to an

- 210 -

audience from the neighboring countries. Of course, KUGA made it a point to have
Burgenland-Croatian bands perform on that occasion.
On account of the central location of Burgenland and as KUGA has the only hall of larger
dimensions that is owned by an association (among the Burgenland-Croatian associations),
KUGA is in a position to welcome guests from all of the Burgenland-Croatian regions on many
occasions, including Vienna, where many Croats from Burgenland live. The concerts of Lado
or Oliver Dragojević, for example, thus transform KUGA into a meeting place for old and young
people. Rock, folklore and theater performances (amateurs and professional groups) at the
KUGA are also attended by visitors from across the borders.

Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt Diocese
1. Pilgrimages
Every year the Croatian section of the Eisenstadt Diocese organizes six major pilgrimages for
the Burgenland-Croatian population – in 2008 these will go to Dürnbach on 29 March 2008
(Burgenland/Austria), Györ on 4 May 2008 (Hungary), one separate pilgrimage for children on
11 June 2008 to Stinatz (Burgenland/Austria), Mariazell from 22 to 24 August 2008
(Styria/Austria), Loretto on 20 and 21 September 2008 (Burgenland/Austria), and to
Eisenstadt/Oberberg on 5 October 2008. Several thousands of Burgenland-Croatians from
Austria – especially from Burgenland and Vienna, but also from other federal provinces of
Austria – from Hungary and Slovakia, Croatia, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina take part in
these pilgrimages. To a large part, the participants are families (often multi-lingual ones), so
that all generations and languages are represented.
The program and organization of the pilgrimages underline the linguistic and cultural diversity,
in addition to the religious character of these events, which is of great benefit for the
Burgenland-Croatian national minority. Attention is paid to bilingualism and thus to tolerance in
the co-existence of the cultures. Moderators, presenters, choirs, Tamburica ensembles, music
groups, cantors, etc also come from all of the aforementioned countries. The necessary
materials (programs, texts, etc.) for these Burgenland-Croatian pilgrimages are also prepared
and made available free of charge to all participants.
The costs incurred are covered to a large extent by the Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt
Diocese, with support from the parishes concerned. Only a very minor portion (for the printing
costs) is covered with funding from the budget of the Federal Chancellery for promoting the
national minorities. Participation fees, admission prices, remunerations for publications or
similar are not collected. These trans-frontier events are of a model character for a united
Europe of different nationalities and serve the purpose of understanding peoples.

- 211 -

2. Spiritual Exercises
Priests, parish councilors and parish staff are invited on a regular basis to attend several days
of spiritual exercises. As the highly qualified presenters and moderators use the BurgenlandCroatian language, participants have the possibility to thus continue their language training, in
addition to receiving spiritual care, all of which is done on a voluntary basis. The mutual
exchange enhances the cultural ties and is of importance for the further existence of the
national minority. The participants are important leaders and multipliers in the work for the
national minority. The Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt Diocese invites Burgenland-Croats
from Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, as well as Croats from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina to
attend these spiritual exercises. The moderators also come from these countries.
3. Glasnik
“Glasnik” is the church newspaper of the Eisenstadt Diocese in the Burgenland-Croatian
language. At the same time, it is the biggest weekly newspaper in Croatian. It is published in
3,600 copies of 8 pager per issue, with some of the 50/51 issues in every year covering two
weeks at a time. The target groups are the Burgenland-Croats in Burgenland, Vienna and the
other federal provinces of Austria, but also in the neighboring countries of Slovakia, Hungary,
Croatia, as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Glasnik” constitutes an important link among
these population groups and promotes tolerance. “Glasnik” was published first at the Easter
holidays in 1946 and has been published every since – 2007 was the 62nd year of its
publication – in a regular and continuous fashion, and it has constituted an essential pillar in
the preservation of the Croatian national minority, as it communicates the Croatian language
and Croatian culture, and because it supports further education among readers, as well as
expands and deepens their Croatian vocabulary. The texts and pictures are on topical subjects
and cover reports from at home and around the world, especially the countries and villages in
which the Burgenland-Croatian population lives (see above!).
A large number of persons in Austria and abroad help to publish the newspaper – they collect
articles, distribute the paper in the parishes, etc. The voluntary helpers in the parishes help on
a gratuitous basis. All tasks – staff and salary costs, fees, printing and mailing costs, office
materials – are borne by the Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt Diocese with funding for the
national minorities given by the Republic of Austria. The revenues from the sale of the
newspaper – since 2001 it is sold at a price of EUR 0.30 per copy – cover the constantly
growing costs only to a minor extent. “Glasnik” is therefore a trans-frontier press medium of
enormous significance for preserving the Burgenland-Croatian population in the Pannonian
region, for passing on and developing the Burgenland-Croatian language and for promoting
the Burgenland-Croatian culture, as well as for the spiritual care of the Croat population.

- 212 -

4. Croatian or bilingual materials
The Croatian Section prepares for the parishes working materials, folders, hand-outs, thematic
presentations, brochures with a specific content on the various topics throughout the year,
events, celebrations and ceremonies, anniversaries and memorial days. These are published
with different types of make-up, lay-out, design and format. In addition to being disseminated in
Austria, they are made available free of charge to the Burgenland-Croatian populations in
Slovakia, Hungary, as well as to the Croats in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. These are
valuable collections of various topics and of significance for the existence and further
development of the Burgenland-Croatian population. The production costs are borne by the
Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt Diocese. Assistance of a minor extent is being provided by
the Federal Chancellery of the Republic of Austria.
5. Continuing Education Events
At the beginning of a working year of the Eisenstadt Diocese, the Croatian Section invites the
parish councilors and parish staff members to attend a conference for their continuing
education in their parishes. In this context, the priorities for the year are being discussed and
the necessary plans are made. The mutual exchange enhances the work and helps the
national minority, as well as its language and culture.
6. New Prayer and Song Book
The first cultural treasure in the history of the Burgenland-Croatian population was a prayer
book. In consequence, the Croatian song and prayer book is an essential element of the
identity of the Croatian national minority. “Kruh nebeski”, which is currently being used, was
published more than 60 years ago and must now be completely re-written – it can no longer be
revised. For many years, the Croatian Section of the Eisenstadt Diocese has been working
intensively of the ”New Croatian Prayer and Song Book”, so that the “New Croatian Prayer and
Song Book” will also be valid for the next decades. As it is a standard book for every Catholic,
the target group comprises all nearly 60,000 Burgenland-Croats, mainly in Burgenland and
Vienna, but also throughout Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The Croatian
Section is working on the publication of the “New Prayer and Song Book”, in addition to all the
many other tasks, resorting to the support of additional assistants with theological, linguistic
and musical qualifications in Austria and abroad. In addition to the voluntary contributions, fees
must also be paid for these contributions. As it is a publication on particularly thin paper (small
format with about 1,200 pages), which must be quite sturdy, though, only a few printing shops
in Austria (none in Burgenland) are in a position to print this book, which means that the
printing costs are quite considerable. Among the quotations received, a printing shop in

- 213 -

Croatia submitted the most economical option – the job was much more favorably priced than
those of printing shops in Austria. Part of the expenses for fees was supported from funding for
the promotion of the national minorities by the Republic of Austria, but the Federal Chancellery
did not indicate that further funds will be available for the printing. The book will be sold on a
long-term basis, and it will not be possible to charge the full price for the copies sold abroad –
no support can be expected from the foreign dioceses, as they need support themselves.
Financing is therefore a major problem. The historical and cultural value, however, is of top
importance for the national minority!
This information is a brief overview of the dimension of the tasks which the Croatian Section of
the Eisenstadt Diocese performs for the benefit of the Burgenland-Croatian national minority. It
does not claim to be a complete overview. One would have to mention many other activities as
well; however, this would exceed the scope of this report.

Kolaric“ from Osijek. More than about 100 groups applied to participate in this competition,
which takes places on several stages and lasts for more than one week. After a pre-selection,
26 groups were admitted to the competition. The Tamburica association “Ivan Vukovic“ from
Parndorf performed in the highest category “orchestra with more than 25 musicians” and
received the gold medal, earning the highest number of points in the whole competition and
third-best result since the existence of the competition.
Promotions: No financing from the association’s funds. When the prizes were awarded at

Hessia, Germany and Switzerland.

UMIZ – Verein zur Förderung des ungarischen Medien- und
Informationszentrums (Association to Promote Hungarian Media and
Information Center)
UMIZ reported about the newly established “Imre Samu Sprachkompetenzzentrum - ISSZ“
(Imre Samu - Language Competence Center)
I1. General Remarks:
The “Imre Samu Sprachkompetenzzentrum” (ISSZ) was set up in compliance with the ideals,
objectives and trans-frontier guidelines of the Hungarian Academy of Science (MTA), as part of
the network for philological research projects (terminological research network). The ISSZ is
an integral component of the Hungarian Media and Information Center (hereinafter referred to
as UMIZ) and meets its tasks as a philological advisory body of this Institute. The ISSZ is more
or less an autonomous institution with its own decision-making authorities. It unites the
philological institutes with Hungarian research objectives in the countries of Austria, Slovenia
and Croatia, which are always headed by regional representative. The common strategy of the
Institute is developed by these representatives. The ISSZ is an international center and does
not only serve to encourage and support research work in the individual autonomous regions,
but – as it also part of the network of other language competence centers – it also participates
in joint trans-frontier works and also regards objectives with an overall European content as
one of its tasks.

- 218 -

Austria has been a member of the European Union since 1995. For many centuries a
population speaking German, Croatian and Hungarian, as well as of Roma origin has been
living together in peace, thus signaling not only the linguistic and cultural diversity of this
country but also offering ideal conditions for implementing joint projects. With the scientific
work undertaken by the Institute, we would like to draw public attention to the integrating force
of languages and cultures, to the preservation and cultivation of a linguistic diversity, to those
values that are integral components of the cultural heritage of the entire region. Preserving the
language and the national identity is the common responsibility of the population belonging to
all three nations.
2. The Profile
Language competence centers:
The research institutions of the Hungarian Academy of Science (MTA) in Slovakia, the Ukraine
and Serbia were set up in 2001 to study the language use and the modifications (everyday
variants) of the language of the Hungarian national minority communities. The locations of the
Szabó T. Attila Language Competence Center are at Kolozsvár (Romania) and
Sepsiszentgyörgy (Romania), that of the Hodika Antal Institute at Beregszász (Ukraine) and
that of the Scientific Center for Research into Hungarian Civilization at Szabadka (Serbia).
The Institute for Ethnology and Minority Research of the Hungarian Academy of Science
(MTA) is providing the central administrative and specific scientific background for these
institutions. The Philological Institute of the MTA is responsible for managing and coordinating
the specific research projects.
Private Research Activities:
In the year 2003 the research projects on the basis of private initiatives in Austria, Slovenia
and Croatia joined this development. In practice, these activities had meant that independent
individual persons – conducting tasks manageable on a local level – tried to keep up with the
bigger research institutions. This situation came to an end when Szilvia Szoták announced at
the fall conference of the language competence centers, held on 3 and 4 September 2007 at
Debrecen (Hungary), that an institution would be established for them in Burgenland. The
members present unanimously approved and supported this project. The ISSZ is thus the
outcome of a merger among the individual research initiatives from regions in Austria, Slovenia
and Croatia.
Terminological Research Network:
The members of the research network cooperate on an ongoing basis with philologists from
Hungary, i.e. with university departments, research institutions and – particularly close – with

- 219 -

the Philological Institute of th Hungarian Academy of Science (MTA). This cooperation was
confirmed on 8 May 2007 at the board meeting of the Academy when István Kenesei, the
director of the Philological Institute, and János Péntek (who is a professor at the Babes Bolyai
University) on behalf of the research network, signed a cooperation agreement. The
effectiveness of the flow of information between the research network and researchers from
Hungary is enhanced by the Internet platform of the Terminological Research Network
(http://ht.nytud.hu/index.php), where current projects and results are accessible to all
interested persons.

National Minority of the Roma
Verein Romaservice (Roma-Service Association)
Upon an initiative by the Federal Chancellery, a contact was established between the ZORA
association and the Roma association, of which Emmerich Gärtner-Horvath was the director
for many years. As a result of the cooperation that followed “Mri MiniMulti“, a children’s
newspaper in Romany came into being.
Already some 10 years ago, Emmerich Gärtner-Horvath, the chairperson of the association
Roma-Service, alerted Jozek Horvat (Muc), chairperson of the Romani Union, of the
importance of the mother tongue. Ever since “Mri MiniMulti“ – “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ was founded,
the association “Romani Union” has received copies from Emmerich Gärtner-Horvath. Since
the year 2004 the association Roma-Service cooperates with the adult education college of the

- 221 -

Burgenland-Croats. The monolingual children’s newspaper “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ was given a
new lay-out. “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ was upgraded from a pedagogical perspective.
Since June 2007 there is cooperation between the adult education college of the BurgenlandCroats, the association Roma-Service and the Romani Union of Murska Sobota in Slovenia.
So far, the Romani Union has published 2 issues of “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ in Prekmurski
Romany.
Procedure:
We, the association Roma-Service, get the texts for every issue in German from the adult
education college of the Burgenland-Croats. Josef Schmidt translates these texts into
Burgenland Romany. Then the texts (in German and Burgenland Romany) are sent to the
Romani Union, attention Monika Sandreli, who then translates them into Prekmurski Romany.
After translating, we at Roma-Service are informed by e-mail about the status of affairs. The
texts, where Monika Sandreli had difficulties, are then translated by Josef Schmidt of the
Roma-Service on site, after an appointment has been made. At the same time, the corrections
are made. After all texts have been checked, they are sent by e-mail to MAS MSc Stefan
Bunyai. He produces the lay-out for the texts that he receives. After the lay-out has been
finished, Josef Schmidt and/or Monika Sandreli receive a pdf file for first corrections. After all
corrections have been made, Stefan Bunyai receives the files as e-mails or is given the
corrections over the phone, which can then be entered into the original files. Then there is
second round of corrections. If there are no further corrections, the text is okayed for printing.
The printing is done in Austria. Once “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ has been finished, it will be taken to
Murska Sobota by the RomBus and handed to the chairperson of the Romani Union.
Financing and field of application of “Mri nevi MiniMulti“:
“Mri nevi MiniMulti“ is financed by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Slovenia. “Mri
nevi MiniMulti“ is used in nursery schools and schools. Moreover, it is distributed in Roma
settlements. The children’s newspaper is also available in libraries, municipalities and other
public places. For the year 2008, 6 issues of the children’s newspaper “Mri nevi MiniMulti“ are
planned in Prekmurski Romany. This year, one further issue will be published.

ANNEX III: COMMENTS BY THE ADVISORY
COUNCILS FOR THE NATIONAL MINORITIES
Advisory Council for the Czech National Minority
At its meeting on 4 December 2007 the Advisory Council for the Czech National
Minority discussed the draft of the 2nd Report of the Republic of Austria pursuant to §
15 (1) of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which the
Federal Chancellery had communicated. It suggested that the names of the three
Czech or bilingual periodicals of the national minority should be mentioned under
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities). These are the periodicals concerned:
-

Česká a slovenská Videň dnes

-

Kulturní klub

-

Videňské svobodné listy

Moreover, it was decided to add the following additions to the Report:
Additional Comments on the Second Report of the Republic of Austria
pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages by the Advisory Board for the Czech National Minority
Ad Article 8 (Education)
On the basis of the First Report of the Republic of Austria pursuant to Article 15 (1) of
the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages the Committee of Ministers
of the Council of Europe indicated as a first item in its recommendations a structural
language policy for the protection and promotion of the languages indicated by
Austria in the course of ratification.
As a matter of principle, the promotion of the languages of the national minorities has
been incorporated with constitutional-law standing in Article 2 (8) of the Federal
Constitution Act. The most important instrument to promote a language is to teach it
on an adequate level. It is indispensable for this type of teaching to establish the

necessary schools. The legal frame that is currently in place in Austria comprises two
federal laws which, however, are restricted in their content and geographical terms to
the Slovene language in Carinthia and the Croatian and Hungarian language in
Burgenland.
At present, there is no such statutory basis for the Vienna region, in spite of the
criticism in the report of the Experts’ Committee for the European Charter of the
Regional or Minority Languages of January 2005. There is also no state-run school in
Vienna which offers adequate instruction in the languages of the national minorities
residing here. For the Czech and Slovak languages, this lacuna is bridged by private
schools (primary school, bilingual secondary school, 5th to 8th grade-grammar
school) of the Komensky School Association. As is mentioned in the 2nd Report of
the Republic of Austria, the State pays for the teachers at these schools. The
additional costs, though, incurred by the instruction, as well as the maintenance of
the school are the responsibility of the school association. In this context, the school
association is supported with funds from the budget to promote the national
minorities, as the Czech organizations waive a major part (75%) of the promotion
intended for their sake for the benefit of the school maintenance costs. However, this
support is not enough, by far, in order to ensure the maintenance of the schools.
Fortunately, the federal province of Vienna has been supporting the facilities for one
year now. As there are no long-term guarantees, though, these funds have only a
limited effect on ensuring the permanent operation of the schools.
The promotion of the Czech and Slovak languages in Vienna has therefore neither
been ensured by law nor fact, in spite of many years of endeavors and a
recommendation to this effect by the Advisory Committee for the Framework
Convention on the Protection of the National Minorities of the Council of Europe,
dated May 2002.
ad Article 11 (Media)
As far as the media are concerned, Austria only ratified support for audio and audiovisual works for the Czech national minority, as a result of which the far more
important problems in connection with radio and television programs will not be
discussed in any further detail at this point.
- 229 -

ad Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities)
The Federal Chancellery supports cultural activities and facilities as one of the
objectives of its efforts to promote the national minorities. As is mentioned in the
comments concerning Article 8, the associations are left with only 25% of the
respective funding for the language and culture of the national minorities, which is
spent mainly on looking after juveniles, but also on sports and cultural activities.

Advisory Council for the Slovene National Minority
At its meeting on 4 December 2007 the Advisory Council for the Slovene National
Minority agreed on a summary by the chairperson of the advisory council. The text
reads as shown below. In this context, a document by the “Article VII Association for
Styria” was added:
Summary Statement of the Advisory Council for the Slovene National Minority
in the Federal Chancellery:
On 19 November 2007 the members of the Advisory Council for the Slovene National
Minority received the 2nd Report pursuant to the European Charter for the Regional
or Minority Languages from the Federal Chancellery for commenting. The Report had
been communicated to the members of the advisory council in electronic form one
week earlier.
Comments by the Council of Slovenes in Carinthia were available at the meeting of
the advisory council on 4 December 2007, and two members announced that they
would submit further comments. The advisory council instructed its chairperson to
produce a summary statement upon receiving these comments and to enclose the
individual comments as annexes. In fact, one further comment was received by the
Article VII Cultural Association for Styria.
1. Concerning the comments of the “Rat der Kärntner Slowenen”

- 230 -

The “Rat der Kärntner Slowenen” submitted comprehensive comments (16 pages)
and arrives at the following conclusions:
“1) The period of time, during which the organizations of the national minorities can
deal in depth with the Report of the Republic of Austria, is much too short, and they
therefore reserve the right to make further comments eventually.
2) The Report is incomplete on many points and, in fact, almost misleading on the
most topical of issues relating to the Slovene population in Carinthia, i.e. the
problems concerning the topographical signs and the official language.
3) During the period under review the Republic of Austria did not comply with the
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe of 19
January 2005 concerning the Slovene population in Carinthia.”
The Council of Slovenes in Carinthia criticizes in particular that the decisions of the
Constitutional Court on bilingual topographical names and signs still have not yet
been implemented, that the provisions for Slovene as an official language (in the
areas of administration, judiciary and private-economic administration), too, are not
comprehensive enough and that, altogether, the Federal Chancellery did not
seriously inquire about the decline in numbers of the Slovene national minority in
Carinthia. In particular, the Council criticizes in its comments that the structural
disadvantages of the Slovene language continue to exist in various respects. The
Council especially refers to the comments of the governor of the federal province of
Carinthia, which put into question the national minorities, as well as a state of law
and order, for which no sanctions have imposed as yet by the State (open refusal to
implement the decisions of the Constitutional Court, etc.). The Council mentions
specifically mention that, for example, the governor of the federal province of
Carinthia replaced the sign posts leading the way to Slovenia by mono-lingual sign
posts. The Council of Slovenes in Carinthia then also criticizes that the presentation
of the history is limited to describing the facts and does not contain any substantive
analysis of the life together. With regard to the promotional funding, the Council of
Slovenes in Carinthia criticizes that the amount of funding for the national minorities
has remained unchanged since 1995 and thus declined by 25% in real terms.

- 231 -

The Council of Slovenes in Carinthia refers to the fact that a growing number of
people in Carinthia are making use of the possibility of a bilingual education at
nursery schools and schools, but that the statutory conditions need to be improved.
2. From the perspective of the Central Association of Slovene Organizations it is
stated
that, in spite of all justified criticism concerning Austria’s policy in connection with the
national minorities, progress has been achieved on some items. It should be pointed
out, in particular, that the Austrian Parliament decided – upon an initiative of all
advisory councils for the national minorities – to adopt a basic policy clause as a
result of which “the Republic (federal, regional and municipal bodies) is committed to
its linguistic and cultural diversity, which has evolved in the course of time and finds
its expression in the autochthonous ethnic groups. The language and culture, the
continued existence and protection of these ethnic groups are to be respected,
safeguarded and promoted.” Although the spirit of this provision has not yet shown its
full impact in some areas, one must nevertheless recognize that positive changes
have occurred (Nursery School Fund Act for Carinthia and expansion of the radio
programs in the Slovene language). Moreover, it must be mentioned that all bills of
the federal province of Carinthia are also submitted to the advisory council for
commenting. With regard to the form of representation, as it is contemplated by the
Council of Slovenes in Carinthia, it must be commented that the overwhelming
majority of the Austrian national minorities do not wish to have such a public.-law
format.
3. In its comments the “Article VII Kulturverein für Steiermark” refers to the history of
the Slovene national minority in Styria and provides detailed data on the promotional
funding, the number of pupils attending Slovene instruction and its activities.
Annex:
1. Comments of the “Rat der Kärntner Slowenen”
2. Comments of the “Article VII Kulturverein für Steiermark”
Comments of the “Rat der Kärntner Slowenen”:
I.) It should be stated at the beginning that the draft of the Report was communicated to the
organizations of the national minorities on 19 November 2007 with the note that the Report will be
- 232 -

discussed at the meeting of the advisory council for the national minority on 4 December 2007 and
that an extension of the period for commenting on the Report will not be possible. When bearing in
mind that the Republic of Austria has been delayed in preparing its Report by several months, but
requires the organizations of the national minorities to comment on a comprehensive report within
14 days, then the time for an in-depth statement is much too short. It would easily have been
possible and could also have been requested that the competent authorities make available the
Report to the organizations of the national minorities much earlier.
II.) Introduction 1.)
ad. 1.)
The draft report indicates global circumstances that positively affect the trend towards assimilation of the
national minorities. It is striking, though, that one of the most important circumstances – especially as far
as Carinthia is concerned – is not mentioned: the political and socio-political pressure toward
assimilation. In Carinthia, in particular, a policy has systematically been pursued on several occasions
which is directed against the national minority and its rights. In the Report, though, the school strikes of
the national minority, the conflict over topographical signs, the “determination of the national minority”
are mentioned in a different chapter. In connection with the so-called “conflict over topographical signs”,
the governor of the federal province of Carinthia has pursued a policy for years that is directed against
the Slovene national minority. The statements in the draft report create the impression that assimilation
is a natural – albeit regrettable – fact that cannot be altered. What is left aside is that this is the result, to
a large part, of a deliberate policy that can be changed.
Introduction 2.)
ad. 2.)
The short historical outline reflects the historical perspective of the Federal Government. From the
perspective of the national minority, this presentation would have to be supplemented in important
points, although this is not the purpose of the Report of the Republic of Austria. However, it is a
questionable statement that the deeper historical roots of the potential for conflict in Carinthia are
“without doubt mainly the historical territorial conflicts.” History has seen territorial conflicts in several
frontier regions in Europe. However, it was only in very few cases that the historical events were
indicated to be the source of the current problems of the national minorities.
In Silesia or the region of Ödenburg/Sopron, for example there were popular referenda in the years
1921 and/or 1921, as was the case in Carinthia, concerning the future status of the territory. There, the
events that occurred 87 years ago have no longer been a problem for a long time, which is in contrast to
Carinthia where commemorating the date of the tenth of October 1920 is misused every year to attack
the Slovene national minority and its rights. On 10 October 2007, for example, the Carinthian Defense
Fighters’ Union (Kärntner Abwehrkämpferbund) published a brochure under the auspices of the
governor of the federal province of Carinthia in his capacity as president of the regional schools’ council
which contains the following paragraph: (quotation)” The Slovenes in Carinthia and the known
- 233 -

opportunists voted for the SHS State of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, as it is documented sufficiently
in their own publications. On account of the popular referendum they are tied – against their will – to a
country with a different population. To this very day they act on various levels that have their center
beyond the state borders in what is today Slovenia.” And then: “This is why we do not any more
bilingual topographical signs in Carinthia, in spite of occasionally differing trends of the times, because
they are a symbol for the presumed existence of a Slovene territory on Carinthian soil.” The fact that the
Slovene national minority fully supports the implementation of its rights, as guaranteed by the
Constitution, is still interpreted as a sign of irridenta in the year 2007 by the highest representative of the
federal province.
In this connection one should also mention that coping with the NS past of the federal province was a
process that took only place on the surface. This is the reason why it was possible that – in the year
2007 – the political party of the governor of the federal province ran advertisements in all Carinthian
media – after the Federal Chancellor had presented a possible solution for the conflict over
topographical signs – which referred to the proposal as a “traitor’s reward” which the (SPÖ) mayor
would be receiving for betraying Carinthia. In the year 2006 the same party placed billboards throughout
the region with the slogan “Do you want the final solution to the conflict over topographical signs?” Even
the deputy chairman of the party admitted that, of course, he was aware of the implicit meaning of the
selected words (“final solution”). By the same token, the governor of the federal province of Carinthia
spread the slogan “Carinthia will become monolingual” in connection with the conflict over topographical
signs and then removed several already existing bilingual topographical signs. The proximity of that
slogan to the Nazi slogan “Carinthians speak German” is obvious. At present, sentiments are aroused
against the new EU Treaty, with the governor of the federal province using the words “The EU will
recover when adopting a Carinthian disposition”. In this connection, he emphasized that he wishes to
fight the new EU Treaty in the same manner as he had fought against the bilingual topographical signs.
The Federal Government does not take this obvious reference to NS terminology – especially in
connection with discussions of the problems of the national minority - as an occasion to clearly
dissociate itself from such statements, as well as to step up efforts to implement the rights of the
national minority. On the contrary, to a large extent these incidents are acknowledged without
commenting on them, and it is emphasized that a solution is only possible together with the governor of
the federal province of Carinthia,
ad. 3.)
The draft report presents the results of the 2001 census. However, these results are not indicative,
unless one states at the same time that the number of members belonging to national minorities has
been decreasing from census to census. The Slovene population in Carinthia, for example, amounted to
about 100,000 persons at the beginning of the 20th century and decreased to about 50,000 at the 1951
census and to only about 13,000 at the 2001 census. It is important to mention this trend because a
decline of such scope can certainly not be explained by “natural assimilation”, on the one hand, and
because, on the other hand, numerous rights of the Slovene national minority depend on their numerical
- 234 -

strength. Although the rights of the Slovene population in Carinthia pursuant to Austria’s State Treaty
would have had to be implemented in the year 1955, this has been the case only to a small extent in
many areas such as Slovene as an official language or topographical signs, and there is the trend to
wait with their implementation until it is no longer necessary because of the further decline in numerical
strength.
ad. I.1.1.)
The draft report says that Article 19 of the Basic State Law has been repealed in parts and that there is
no longer scope for its application. One must contradict this statement. In addition to the listed decision
of the Constitutional Court dating back to the year 1952, there are other decisions which leave this
question unanswered. In the 1990’s there was an initiative to reform the Austrian Constitution, in the
course of which it was planned to state officially that Article 19 of the Basic State Law is no longer
applicable and should be removed from the Basic State Law. This initiative failed after the national
minorities protested vehemently. At present, there are once again efforts to reform the Austrian
Constitution. It is remarkable to note that Article 19 of the Basic State Law is not indicated in the
recently disclosed list of constitutional provisions (comprising several hundreds of stipulations) which
are planned to be abolished or stated to be no longer applicable. One must therefore contradict the view
that Article 19 of the Basic State Law is no longer applicable. The term “ethnic entities” may clearly be
understood to mean “national minorities”, which is the modern concept. Especially the recognition of the
equal status of all languages customarily used in the country in schools, offices and public life is of
maximum importance for the national minority.
ad. I.1.2.)
One should mention that the National Minorities Act was partly revoked by the Constitutional Court, that
major parts of the National Minorities Act urgently need to be reformed and that the national minorities
have submitted detailed proposals for amendments on several occasions which, however, are not
discussed any further.
The ordinance of the Federal Government determining the regional territories in which topographical
signs and indications shall be affixed both in the German and the Slovene languages (Federal Law
Gazette II No. 245/2006) was adopted by the Austrian Federal Government on 30 June 2006. It covers
only two additional municipalities (Bleiburg/Pliberk and Ebersdorf/Drveša vas) than the previous
ordinance from the year 1977, which the Constitutional Court has repealed completely in the meantime.
The new ordinance fully disregards the case law of the Constitutional Court on the bilingual
topographical signs. This also applies to the ordinance published in Federal Law Gazette II No.
263/2006, which has not been implemented as yet. The example of this ordinance shows that the
Austrian Federal Government issues ordinances that deliberately are in contradiction to the case law of
the Constitutional Court and thus the provisions of Article 7, item 3, of the State Treaty of Vienna.

To this very day, the decision of the Constitutional Court of 4 October 2000, file number V 91799-11,
has not been implemented. A new version of the Ordinance on the Use of Slovene as an Official
Language has been overdue for seven years. Nor is there any implementation of the substance of the
decision. In the municipality of St. Kanzian/ Škocjan, for example, which by now has more than 10%
Slovene population, the decision is being ignored and applications in Slovene are not processed. The
decision of the Constitutional Court of 13 December 2001, file number G 213/01-18, V 62, 63/01-18, has
not been implemented to this very day and in not a single one of the places qualifying for it.
The decision of the Constitutional Court of 14 December 2004, file number V 131/03, is a step
backwards in the efforts for a legal implementation of the rights of the national minorities, as it makes it
impossible to claim collective rights of the national minority. In the meantime, an action has been filed
with the European Court for Human Rights in this connection. Renowned constitutional experts – such
as the majority of opinions in the Constitutional Convention – demanded, in agreement with the national
minorities, that representative groups of the national minorities should be granted the right to file an
action as an association. To this very day, this concern of Austria’s national minorities has not been
taken into account. The order issued by the Constitutional Court in its decision to Austrian authorities,
namely to produce bilingual topographical signs in accordance with Article 7, item 3, second sentence,
of the State Treaty of Vienna, has been disregarded to this very day.
The decision of the Constitutional Court of 26 June 2006, file number V 20/2006, actually expressed the
view that the character of a municipality as a “mixed-language administrative district” may also be lost if
the Slovene-language share of the residential population has fallen to below 10%. This decision did not
even consider the problem identified in the provisions of Article 2 (8) of the Federal Constitution Act; in
the opinion of the national minority, the case law on a “declining trend” is also in opposition to the
intentions of both the Charter and the Framework Convention. In this connection, a complaint is pending
with the European Court of Human Rights. Moreover, one further case is pending before the
Constitutional Court in connection with St. Kanzian/ Škocjan – the municipality which is said to have lost
its character as a “mixed-language administrative district”. This case is intended to achieve a writ of
error on the court decision.
In its decision of 13 December 2006, file number V 81/06-14, the Constitutional Court stated that affixing
topographical signs in the Slovene language on a “smaller” separate sign is contrary to the law. To this
very day, this decision has not been implemented. Further complaints concerning this issue are pending
before the Constitutional Court.
In its decision of 13 December 206, file number V 54/06 et alii, the Constitutional Court completely
repealed the 1977 ordinance on topographical signs, indicating as a reason (which is quoted correctly in
the draft report) that it practically rules out that bilingual topographical signs are affixed in other villages
than those listed in the political districts indicated there and/or the political district of Klagenfurt
(environs). The Federal Government nevertheless adopted a new ordinance on topographical signs for
Carinthia on 30 June 2006 which stipulates exactly the same thing. In July 2007, the Federal
- 236 -

Chancellor stated that further political efforts to solve the conflict over topographical signs have failed
during this legislative period. One may therefore assume that Austria does not have the intention to
establish a situation in conformity with the Constitution up to the year 2010, at least.
ad. II.1.2.)
The advisory councils for the national minorities are not statutory organizations of the national minorities
but advisory councils which advise the Federal Government. They are not corporations representing the
national minorities. For a long time, some of the national minorities have expressed the wish that
representative organizations under public law be set up for the national minorities. The organizations of
the national minorities unanimously hold the view that representative organizations of the national
minorities should be granted the right to file actions as associations. There are no statutory provisions
on the representation of the national minorities, and the organizations of the national minorities have the
legal status of private associations.
ad. I.1.4.)
In its draft report the Federal Government has reproduced the full text of the recommendations by the
Committee of Ministers concerning the First Report of the Republic of Austria. The Committee of
Ministers recommended a structural policy for the protection and promotion of the languages indicated
by Austria in the course of ratification, as well as to create conditions for their use in public life. In
connection with the Slovene population in Carinthia this recommendation was not implemented.
Numerous municipalities refuse the use of the Slovene language before authorities. The governor of the
federal province of Carinthia pursues a policy under the slogan “Carinthia is becoming monolingual”
which is diametrically opposed to the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers. The Committee of
Ministers recommended that the decision of the Constitutional Court on the use of Slovene as an official
language be implemented without delay, which has not been the case as yet, and no efforts in this
direction can be discerned.
As to the recommendation that a change in the status of schools or a change in the rules regarding the
appointment of school staff in the Slovene-language area should not negatively affect Slovene-language
school education in Carinthia, one should first comment in a positive vein by saying the measures
concerning the training of bilingual teachers at the new Pedagogical University are pointing in the right
direction, although it is too early to give an evaluation of any results. A guarantee that the position of
school principal at a bilingual school requires a bilingual qualification continues to be outstanding. In the
course of the current discussions on education in Austria, the Federal Government decided recently
that it is the responsibility of the parents to ensure that children are fluent in the German language when
entering school. In this context, no consideration was given to the national minorities. It would be
desirable and recommend/able to attach as much importance to fluency in the language of the national
minority in the bilingual area as to fluency in the German language at a pre-school age, for example by
special measures on the level of the nursery schools. There are serious deficiencies in this field; for
example, there are not even rules for acquiring qualifications for bilingual nursery-school instruction.
- 237 -

Providing care of children in the afternoons is being expanded increasingly, but ensuring such afternoon
care in a bilingual form is not ensured either.
The draft report quotes from the Program of the Federal Government which states in connection with
the implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court on topographical signs that this “shall be
constitutionally safeguarded with the maximum possible consensus from the ethnic groups on the basis
of existing proposals” and that this regulation shall be implemented by the summer of 2007. This part of
the government’s program has not been implemented; even very far-reaching proposals by the Slovene
national minority for a compromise were refused.
In connection with the implementation of the decision on Slovene as an official language, The draft
report states “with regard to the implementation of the so-called ‘official-language’ decision of the
Constitutional Court it is pointed out that, according to the present legal situation, there are linkages
between the area of application of the bilingual topographical signs and indications and the scope of
application of an official language. On 4 July 2007 a government bill was submitted to the National
Council (file number XXIII.GP-NR 263/A) concerning a federal law amending the National Minorities Act.
The bill formulates the new regulations for bilingual topographical signs and indications. One will have to
wait for the requisite decisions in the National Council which will be of relevance for the aforementioned
linkages to regulations on official languages.”
These comments can only be regarded as cynical. The decision on the official language was passed 7
years ago. In the course the past seven years, there has been no attempt whatsoever to implement it. In
connection with the topographical signs, the Constitutional Court has taken a total of 12 decisions to
date, none of which has been implemented. Further decisions are expected for December 2007. The
legal situation has been clarified completely, but the Austrian Federal Government refuses to produce a
situation in conformity with the Constitution. The government bill that was submitted to Parliament
certainly does not provide for a complete implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court.
Moreover, there are no discussions of the bill. Rather, pressure is exerted on the representatives of the
national minority – in spite of their very far-reaching readiness to reach a compromise – to agree with a
still further curtailing of their rights, as laid down in the State Treaty.
It is not correct to maintain that the case law of the Constitutional Court ensures that a change in the
status of schools or a change in the rules for the appointment of school staff in the Slovene-language
and bilingual area do not negatively affect Slovene-language education in Carinthia. The Constitutional
Court merely applied the valid legal situation. If any negative impact on Slovene-language school
education were to be effectively ruled out, farther-reaching measures would be required (which are not
applied). The so-called “objective procedure” for the appointment of school staff, in particular, does not
ensure that the bilingual qualification result in a correspondingly positive evaluation in the course of this
procedure.

- 238 -

It is also incorrect that the use of the Slovene language before the relevant court and administrative
authorities has been ensured by internal organizational measures and steps by the authorities. At the
district administrative authority of Klagenfurt/Celovec, for example, it is not possible in many areas to
obtain forms in the Slovene language. In the municipality of Eberndorf/Dobrla vas parties were asked to
produce a translation of forms themselves. In the municipality of St. Kanzian/Škocjan the use of the
Slovene language as an official language is ignored completely. To date, no sanctions at all have been
imposed on the civil servants who ignore the use of the Slovene language as an official language. In
connection with civil-status documents, civil servants actually refuse to enter officially recognized
bilingual names of municipalities. When asking to be able use the Slovene language for traffic tickets or
alike, the result is generally that a higher fine is imposed than would be the case if one had not asked to
use the Slovene language. In this context, in particular, many more examples could be given where
users of the Slovene language are at a disadvantage.
ad. II.II.2.)
Although the Constitutional Court stated that the existing allocation of constituencies in Carinthia is
compatible with the principle of equality, the division into constituencies is nevertheless a drawback for
the Slovene national minority, as its settlement area is divided up and allocated to four constituencies,
which makes it impossible for the national minority to obtain a seat for its own group in an election.
Respect of the geographical area is also disregarded in other respects and is to the detriment of the
national minority. The Constitutional Court decided, for example, that it is not admissible to use the
Slovene language before the local court at Klagenfurt/Celovec. It reached this conclusion by arguing
that at the time when the State Treaty was signed, the court district of Klagenfurt/Celovec did not have
more than 10% of a Slovene population. However, one will reach this conclusion only if you look at the
capital of the federal province of Klagenfurt/Celovec jointly with the political district of KlagenfurtLand/Celovec-dežela. If one had only looked at the political district of Klagenfurt-Land/Celovec-dežela,
the evaluation would have been different.
The former court districts of Eberndorf/Dobrla vas, Rosegg/Rožek and Arnoldstein/ Podklošter were
shut down. This happened quite some time ago, but after the State Treaty had been signed. In keeping
with the case law of the Constitutional Court, the Slovene language would have been admitted as an
official language in court, but this is not the case before the courts that have now geographical
competences, i.e. the courts of Völkermarkt/Velikovec and/or Villach/Beljak.
It was only possible for the Constitutional Court to reach its conclusions in the year 2006, namely that
the municipality of St. Kanzian/Škocjan no longer had the character of a mixed-language administrative
district and that there was therefore no longer the need for bilingual topographical signs, because for the
2001 census – in contrast to previous censuses – the area of the municipality of St. Kanzian/Škocjan
was defined differently, which almost doubled its population, as additional areas were included. If one
had respected the geographical area, the percentage of the Slovene population would still have been
higher than 10% and the decision would have been different. One must state in connection with respect
- 239 -

for the geographical territory in general that the scope of application must not be altered to the detriment
of the national minority. However, this happens all the time, either because only the current results of a
census are taken into consideration, while leaving aside the implementation of the rights, deriving from
the 1955 State Treaty of Vienna, concerning the official languages or the bilingual topographical signs. If
the provisions had been implemented in 1955, about 600 municipalities would have to have bilingual
topographical signs, when applying the case law of the Constitutional Court. At present, only 94
municipalities have been earmarked for this purpose. If one were to take the results of the most recent
census, i.e. of 2001, the number would only be about 250, in keeping with the case law of the
Constitutional Court. The geographical territory was therefore reduced considerably in its size by not
implementing the rights of the national minority. If these provisions had been implemented in 1955, the
Slovene language would have had to be admitted as an official language in all municipalities of the
bilingual area. As there is now the will to only take account of the current results of censuses, this is
only the case in about one third of the bilingual area.
ad. II.3.1.)
The Federal Government itself stated that the amount of money for the promotion of the national
minorities has remained completely the same since the year 1995. When considering inflation this
means that the amount of money spent on promoting the national minorities has actually gone down by
about 20%. The advisory councils for the national minorities have been asking for a major increase in
the funds for the promotion of the national minorities, especially on account of the fact that the sums
granted in 1995 were insufficient by far in order to cope with all tasks. However, the amount spent on
promoting the national minorities is not raised. The overall budget of the Austrian government has
expanded considerably during this period. When taking account of the loss in money value, due to
inflation, as well as of the expansion of the overall budget, the result is that the share of money for the
promotion of the national minorities, as part of the total expenditure of the State, has gone down
considerably. One cannot therefore speak of resolute action in connection with promotion.
ad. II.II.8.)
Under this heading, the draft report deals with measures to eliminate discrimination. However, only the
applicable statutory measures are mentioned. It would go beyond the scope of these comments to deal
in detail with the individual provisions. It should be pointed out, though, that no decision of the
Constitutional Court and – to the extent that can be gathered – no other authority has referred to Article
8 (2) of the Federal Constitution Act. If more attention were paid to this provision, several decisions
would have to be of a different content.
The draft report also mentions the Code of Ethics of the Press. However, this code does not prevent a
range of Carinthian media, in particular, from publishing letters to the editors which are clearly directed
against the Slovene national minority in their content and sometimes are almost inflammatory in their
nature.
ad. II.II.9.)
- 240 -

This section deals with the support given towards promoting respect and understanding among the
language groups. In this connection, reference is made to the comments above in relation to regional
politics in Carinthia which certainly are not of a character that will enhance the understanding among the
language groups. On the contrary, they quite deliberately foment prejudices against the Slovene
national minority.
ad. II.10.)
This section deals with the consideration given to the needs expressed and to the setting up of the
various bodies. The Federal Government refers exclusively to the advisory councils for the national
minorities. The needs expressed on several occasions by the organizations of the national minorities
are not mentioned. As a rule, no attention is paid to the recommendations made by the advisory council
for the Slovene national minority, except when it comes to financial matters. However, it is not only the
needs expressed that are not given any attention; the same applies also to obligations imposed by
decisions of the supreme courts.
ad. III.2.)
Article 8 (Education)
The comment is appropriate that special attention is paid to the bilingual nursery-school system in
Carinthia. It is not mentioned, though, that statutory rules are completely absent in connection with
public nursery schools. It largely depends on the good will of a mayor whether bilingual nursery-school
groups are set up and to what extent the Slovene language is used in these nursery-school groups. It is
acknowledged as a positive fact that financial support is available for private bilingual nursery schools
under the Nursery-School Fund Act for Carinthia. There is, however, still room for expansion.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that one should also strive to achieve a statutory solution for the public
nursery schools. It should be pointed out that there is a political discussion to make attendance of a
nursery school compulsory, at least for the last pre-school year. The consequence would be that the last
year of nursery school would also have to be regarded as “elementary education”, as mentioned in
Article 7 (2) of the State Treaty of Vienna, which should make it possible throughout the bilingual area to
sign up for bilingual nursery-school classes. However, no specific preparations are noticeable as yet in
this direction.
In the context of schools it is correct to point out that the number of pupils is increasing who sign up for
bilingual education but do not have any previous knowledge of the Slovene language, and that the
pupils registered for bilingual education with a normal knowledge of the Slovene language only
constitute a minority. One would have to take measures that make sure that especially children with a
good knowledge of the Slovene language upon entering school are not at a disadvantage in their further
learning of the language. In view of the fact that by now 40% of the pupils in the bilingual area sign up
for bilingual instruction, the principle of registration should be re-considered, at least on a medium-term
basis. At present, the discriminating provision of § 7 (1) second sentence of the Minorities’ Schools Act
for Carinthia still applies which stipulates that pupils can only be made to use Slovene as the language
- 241 -

of instruction or to learn Slovene as a compulsory subject if this is the will of their legal representatives.
This means that every other language can be offered as a compulsory subject, although the legal
representative of a child is not in favor of that language, but Slovene may be taught only if the parents
agree to it.
We continue to fear that small school entities will be closed or converted into school branches
(Expositur) on a medium-term basis, on account of the decline in pupil numbers. This will be a major
disadvantage for the Slovene national minority, which still has the largest number of pupils especially in
the small schools. One should therefore take measures that will compensate, at least, these drawbacks
which may well be inevitable, at least on a medium-term basis. The draft report does not mention at all
the problems in connection with looking after pupils in the afternoons. Solutions are missing which
would ensure bilingual care for pupils also in the afternoons. The afternoon care for pupils is
increasingly becoming the standard situation and has actually become part of everyday school life. If
there are no provisions for bilingual services, this means in fact that the available options of school life
are reduced by fifty per cent.
When looking at the situation in Carinthia, one notices that 10% of the children in primary schools are
registered for bilingual instruction: However, as they enter secondary school, their share drops to only
4%. In reality, it is only the pupils of the Slovene grammar school that continue to learn the Slovene
language on secondary level I, whereas for the majority of the pupils that are signed up for bilingual
instruction on the lower school level contacts with the Slovene language end when completing primary
school. When bearing in mind the discussions about introducing “integrated schools” (Gesamtschule) or
“new middle schools” (neue Mittelschule) it would be urgently required to take the necessary action so
that the positive development on the level of the primary schools is not aborted on the secondary-school
level.
Article 9 (Judicial authorities)
Court activities in the Slovene language continue to be restricted to the local courts at Bleiburg/ Pliberk,
Eisenkappel/Železna Kapla and Ferlach/Borovlje. Major parts of the bilingual area, including
municipalities in which the Slovene language has been recognized as an official language and where, in
fact, topographical signs have been set up in two languages, do not have the possibility to use the
Slovene languages in proceedings on the level of the local courts.
The information that there was no case before the regional court of Klagenfurt/Celovec that was
conducted in the Slovene language is not correct. There were proceedings in the Slovene language.
However, they were not ended by a court decision but by a settlement. In one case involving an
organization of the national minority the regional court Klagenfurt/Celovec refused to use Slovene as the
language in court, arguing that only physical persons have that right. An appellate instance could not be
asked to review the case, as it was ended by a settlement on the problem at issue. It is an urgent need
to clarify whether legal entities also have the right to use the Slovene language in court.
- 242 -

Article 10 (Administrative authorities and public services)
To a large extent, no major problems are incurred when using the Slovene language before the district
administrative authorities of Völkermarkt/Velikovec. However, especially within the domain of the district
administrative authorities of Klagenfurt/Celovec, submissions in Slovene are often ignored or dealt with
only after considerable delays. It proves to be extremely negative that, as a matter of principle, the
Slovene language is not admitted as an official language in the capital of the federal province. As a
result, there will be situations in which, for example, a large number of the Slovene organizations that
have their headquarters Klagenfurt/Celovec are deprived of the possibility of using Slovene as the
official language. In this context, it is overlooked that, as a matter of course, Klagenfurt/Celovec – the
capital of the federal province – is also the center of the region for the national minority of the Slovenes
in Carinthia.
As far as civic-status documents are concerned, the Slovene national minority is excluded to a large
extent from the possibility of obtaining these documents in their language. This is, in turn, once again
due to the fact that Slovene is not admitted as an official language in Klagenfurt/Celovec, the capital of
the federal province. As many hospitals are located there, a large number of births and deaths will take
place in Klagenfurt/Celovec.
No provisions whatsoever continue to exist for the area of private-economic administration, requiring
that Slovene is used as an official language. With the exception of the municipalities, the same applies
to the self-governing corporations such as the professional interest groups with compulsory
membership, the social-security institutes, etc.
One may certainly not say that the activities of the administrative authorities are largely conducted in
two languages in a bilingual area, as it is the case in many parts of Europe. The Slovene language is
only used if an application to this effect expressly calls for it. The existing rules are discriminating in their
effect if one considers the difficulties that are frequently encountered, as well as the psychological
barriers, the financial drawbacks and delays caused in this connection.
As far as the municipalities are concerned, one must state once again that the Ordinance on the Use of
Slovene as an Official Language has not been amended as yet, although there has been need for
action for some seven years, on account of the decision of the Constitutional Court on the use of official
languages. In numerous municipalities the possibility to use Slovene as an official language is being
ignored.
It does not suffice that a number of forms in the Slovene language are available for downloading. This
would have to apply for all forms. As far as could be gathered, the possibility to use the language of the
national minority for public announcements is not used at all. This would have to be an obligation for
those municipalities in which Slovene is an official language.

- 243 -

The provisions of the Civil Status Act are completely inadequate. It is not even possible to indicate the
residence of a person in the two languages, not even in those cases where bilingual topographical signs
are provided expressly for that place. The draft report of the Federal Government indicates that the
diacritic signs that do not exist in the German language must also be used. The practical situation is
different: A school at Völkermarkt/ Velikovec was informed – in reaction to its request to also provide the
Slovene diacritic signs for the IT program that was used – that this was not possible pursuant to the Civil
Status Act and that the diacritic signs should be transposed phonetically into German. A large part of
the IT programs used by the public administration does not have the capability to use diacritic signs.
The authorities refuse to issue excerpts from the civil-status registers as an official translation in the
language of the national minority. Translators are instructed to produce a certified translation. However,
such a translation does not have any official character.
Altogether, the provisions on the official languages constitute an extreme disadvantage for the language
of the national minority. The issue has required reforms for a long time. As the conflict over
topographical signs has dominated discussions as a whole in relation to the situation of the Slovene
population in Carinthia, there were not even any initial steps by the Austrian Federal Government
towards a discussion of a reform of the provisions on official languages.
Article 11 (Media)
The arrangements for the radio programs of “Radio Dva – Agora“ are satisfactory. In the field of TV
programs, though, one half-hour television program per week is not sufficient, when comparing this to
the arrangements for other European national minorities. Considerable problems also exist in
connection with press promotion. The Carinthian press-promotion law more or less rules out any
promotion for newspapers published in the Slovene language on account of its criteria (number of
copies, periodicity of publication, etc.). General press promotion funding is too low by far, and without
additional promotional funding from the Republic of Slovenia, “Novice” – the only weekly newspaper that
is not published by the Church – could not be printed.
Article 12 (Cultural activities and facilities)
One should mention here that promotional funding for the national minorities has remained unchanged
since 1995. As a result, it has actually decreased considerably. On account of the short deadline it is not
possible to deal with this item in detail. It should be mentioned, though, that the funds granted to the
Slovene Music School/ Glasbena šola are completely inadequate. The funding per pupil at Glasbena
šola is less than ¼ of the funding granted per pupil in a German-language music school. This is in
contradiction to the Carinthian regional legislation. Still, there is so far no readiness to increase the
promotional funding. This ought to be also in contradiction to the provision of Article 7 item 4 of the
State Treaty of Vienna.
Article 13 (Economic and social life)
- 244 -

The report on this Article is extremely cursory. On account of the short deadline for commenting is,
however, not possible to comment on this point here and now.
Article 14 (Trans-frontier exchanges)
The report is incomplete and would have to be supplemented to a large extent. Two points should also
be mentioned in this context:
At the instigation of the governor of the federal province of Carinthia the previously bilingual road signs
along the route to Slovenia (for example Ljubljana/Laibach) were replaced by mono-lingual signs. The
Austrian Federal Minister of Finance announced that as of 1 January 2008 the import of cigarettes from
Slovenia will be limited to 200 units, unless they bear German warnings. This regulation is certainly
contrary to EU provisions and is a discrimination of the Slovene language, especially since cigarettes
with warnings in Italian, for example, may be imported without limitation in number. These are but two
examples for the way in which trans-frontier exchanges continue to be burdened and depend essentially
on the initiatives undertaken by the Slovene organizations.
III.
1.)

It can be stated by way of summary:
The deadline for detailed comments on the Report of the Republic of Austria by the organizations
of the national minorities is far too short, and they must therefore reserve the right to make further
comments.
The Report is incomplete on many points and almost misleading, especially on the most topical
issues in connection with the Slovene population in Carinthia, i.e. the problems of topographical
signs and of Slovene as an official language.
The Republic of Austria did not take comply with the recommendations of the Committee of
Ministers of 19 January 2005 with regard to the Slovene population in Carinthia.

THE FIRST PAGES REFER TO HISTORY. OF COURSE, CARINTHIA IS IN THE
FOREGROUND. “STYRIA” IS MENTIONED OCCASIONALLY IN ORDER TO DO JUSTICE
TO THIS REGION (AS OF PAGE 11)

The Slovene population in Styria
As early as the beginning of the Middle Ages, there was a Slovene population on the
territory of today’s federal province of Styria. It lived in peace with its Germanspeaking neighbors. Traces of Slavic settlements can still be found today in all parts
of Styria. Numerous names of places and rivers point to this fact, for example “Graz”
(from the Slovene word gradec = small fortress). Both on this side of the border and
on the other side of today’s southern border of Styria, the Slovene population
- 245 -

belonged mainly to the rural population, whereas the middle classes in the towns and
market places were primarily German-speaking.
On 1 December 1918, the “Kingdom of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia” was solemnly
proclaimed in Belgrade. Already on 1 November Major Rudolf Maister had taken over
the powers of command in the town of Marburg/Maribor. Then, his troops advanced
northwards and occupied the bilingual region within a few weeks, including also
several German-speaking municipalities to its north (such as, for example, Mureck).
The army engaged in heavy fighting around the border municipalities of Soboth,
Leutschach, Spielfeld, Radkersburg and the surrounding municipalities. These
events left deep marks in the persons concerned and made life together difficult for
many decades. After the South Slavic troops had withdrawn, there was not only
persecution of those persons who had supported the occupiers, but the distrust
against all persons of Slovene mother tongue also grew.
On 10 September 1919, the new boundaries of the national territory were laid down
in the State Treaty of St. Germain between Austria and the former wartime
opponents of the collapsed monarchy. The southern boundary of Styria with the
newly founded South Slavic state (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia) was drawn in such a
way that parts of the bilingual region (such as, for example, Windisch Bühel – south
of Mureck – and Abstaller Feld) became part of Yugoslavia, whereas others (the
areas around Soboth, Leutschach and Radkersburg) became part of Austria. When
the border line was drawn, personal and economic relations were ruptured. For some
farmers, the national boundary suddenly extended between their estates and their
fields, sometimes even between their homes and their barns. As a result of the
border line many – both Austrian and Slovene – places lost their back country, which
accelerated the exodus movement. Up to the present times, the region along the
border has been a crisis region.
After the occupation by the South-Slavs and with the new borderlines it became
increasingly difficult for Slovenes in Styria to declare that Slovene was their mother
tongue. The population was expected to indicate its loyalty to Austria and the
German nationality. The liberation of Austria from National Socialism would have
been an opportunity to promote the co-existence of two languages in the border
region. In reality, though, the old fears and suppression patterns were continued.
- 246 -

These were further kindled by expelling the German-speaking population of lower
Styria and by Yugoslavia claiming territory from Austria. The bilingual population was
thus in a dual predicament: Persons admitting that Slovene was their mother tongue
were readily suspected of being close, in ideological terms, to Communist
Yugoslavia. In addition, the bilingual population lost its cross-border contacts more
than ever before. Moreover, the economic situation of the bilingual population also
deteriorated in the cut-off border location. There was therefore a massive exodus
which, in turn, further decreased the bilingual population.
Change of Trend
The “Article VII Cultural Association for Styria” (Artikel VII Kulturverein für Steiermark
/ Društvo člen 7 za avstrijsko) is the organization representing the minority of
Slovenes in Styria who are natives of the federal province of Styria (2001 census:
about 2,200 persons). After many decades of political work, it is now represented in
the advisory council for the national minority in the Federal Chancellery.
The change of trend – after many decades of non-recognition – came in 1988 when
the “Article VII Cultural Association for Styria” (Artikel VII Kulturverein für Steiermark /
Društvo člen 7 za avstrijsko) was founded. The association pointed out that there
was this “forgotten minority”, it fought for its rights, as entrenched in the State Treaty
and it had to fight against strong resentments in the beginning, as the dominating
political forces denied its existence and spoke of an “error” in the State Treaty. The
prevailing package deal between minorities’ issues in Austria and Slovenia
obstructed the recognition process, and it was only with the political changes in the
former Yugoslavia and the independence of Slovenia that recognition began to take
shape.
In 1995 the association bought a farming estate at Laafeld/Potrna near Bad
Radkersburg

which

was

refurbished

with

assistance

from

Vienna

and

Laibach/Ljubljana and inaugurated officially in 1998 by Heinz Fischer, who was then
president of the National Council. The association regards this cultural center as a
place of encounter between Slovenes and Austrians, on the one hand, as well as a
cultural center for the local monolingual and multi-lingual population. Avgust Pavel,
who was born in the nearby village of Cankova, and his family, which lived in this
house for a few years, gave their name to the cultural center. Pavel grew up being tri- 247 -

lingual – Slovene, Hungarian and German. He studied in Budapest and worked later
as a philologist, ethnologist, poet, teacher at the University of Szeged and museum
director. His efforts were to connect the peoples of Hungary and Slovenia. His life
followed this principle of a multiple identity, which was the reason to choose him as
the person to give his name to the center.
On the occasion of Slovenia’s accession to the EU on 1 May 2004 the expanded and
newly designed museum of the minority was opened at the Pavel House. In addition
to the already existing presentation of the history of the Slovene population in Styria,
the basic concept was expanded to include all minorities living in the Bad
Radkersburg region in the past and at present.

The district school inspector for Radkersburg wants to make the Slovene language
and a number of school partnerships the priority of the district. HS/RS Arnfels
continues to develop its partnerships with OŠ Muta and OŠ Šentilj by way of
numerous projects. HS Leibnitz II is looking for a Slovene partner school and/or has
established first contacts.
The continuing training of Slovene teachers is another concern of the “Article VII
Cultural Association”. The association therefore informs teachers of seminars and
new text books. In 2006, for the first time, a meeting of teachers was organized at the
Pavel House so that teachers of Slovene can get to know each other and exchange
opinions, as well as discuss problems and ideas. In this context, we receive support
from Valerija Perger, a pedagogical consultant at Raab/Porabje, for the Slovene
teachers, but also from teachers of Slovene in Carinthia.
VEČER, the daily newspaper published in Maribor, cannot be bought in Graz, nor
can any other daily Slovene paper be obtained in Graz.

ORF: It would be nice if at least Dober dan, Koroška could also be viewed in

Styria at a normal time of the day. This is apart from the fact that the ORF has denied
our existence (see press release).

Chamber of Commerce, and many others.
Clarification on the ORF’s obligations concerning the culture of the minorities
(attached):
1. A clear denial was issued in response to a complaint filed by the “Österreichische
Volksgruppenzentrum” (Austrian Center for the National Minorities - ÖVZ) concerning
the television and radio rights of one section of the minorities living in Austria. The
reasons given by the director in his negative reply are more or less based on the
- 249 -

viewpoint that the national minorities already receive an over-abundance of
programs.
2. In the case of the recognized minority of the “Slovenes in Styria”, however, this
judgment even ventures to deny the Slovenes living in Styria – who indicated their
affiliation in the most recent census in 2001 (and they account for nearly one fifth of
the national minority of the Slovenes in Carinthia – the existence of a minority status.
So far, these arguments had only been used in the discussions over minorities by
strongly nationalistically inclined forces and this is a novel feature in the way that the
ORF as a public-law broadcasting corporation deals with this issue.
3. It must be stated that for preparing its comments (file number GZ 611.922/0001
BKS2007) the ORF neither went on site, nor contacted representatives of the
minority. It only quoted from the contribution of a historian of obvious affiliation on the
Internet. This serves as a basis for the ORF’s arguments. The process of researching
the issue should not be a subject for discussion. However, it must be vehemently
refuted that – at a time of (largely justified) excess coverage of the rights of migrants
by the ORF, an autochthonous minority is denied its existence!
We therefore appeal of the civil-society public to continue the discussion and to let
this judgment not stand as it is.

Advisory Council for the Croatian National Minority
At its meeting on 5 December 2007 the Advisory Council for the Croatian National
Minority commented as follows on the draft report by the Republic of Austria:
1. The advisory council thinks that the table with the results of the 2001 census is
misleading with regard to the language of everyday usage (“Introduction – Item 3.
The Numerical Strength of the National Minorities”), as the number of persons
speaking the languages of the national minorities is usually given in proportion to the
total population and not in relation to the number of indications concerning a nonGerman everyday language. Moreover, the advisory council is of the opinion that the
Croatian national minority was put at a statistical disadvantage by the distinction
- 250 -

between “Croatian” and “Burgenland-Croatian”, as a similar distinction between the
language variants was not made for any of the other languages of the national
minorities. The number of speakers of languages of the national minorities – and
especially of Hungarian – is increased considerably by non-autochthonous speakers
of the languages of the national minorities (which can also be gathered from the fact
that a large number of these speakers were born abroad). For the Croatian national
minority, though, the Croats migrating to Austria were not counted as belonging to
the national minority. It actually happened that Burgenland Croats indicated
“Croatian” by mistake at the last census. This is why the Croatian national minority
seems to be smaller in proportion to the other national minorities than is actually the
case.
2. The advisory council suggests that the federal province of Vienna should also be
recognized as an autochthonous settlement area of the Croatian population and be
granted protection according to Part III of the Charter.
3. The advisory council points out that the federal province of Burgenland only pays
for the assistant nursery-school teachers during the first two years and that the
operators of nursery schools – as a rule the municipalities – must then refund the
costs to the federal province. It is also regarded as unsatisfactory that the public
nursery schools in Carinthia do not have their own regional legislation on bilingualism
and that the public bilingual nursery schools in Burgenland do not receive any
promotional funding for the national minorities, which is in contrast to the public
bilingual nursery schools in Carinthia.

Advisory Council for the National Minority of the Roma
On 5 December 2007 the Advisory Council for the National Minority of the Roma
made the following comments on the draft of the 2nd Report of the Republic of Austria
pursuant to Article 15 of the Charter on Minority or Regional languages:
Ad “Introduction / 2.6.”: Here one should add that in 1988 the detainees of
Lackenbach were given equal status as the other victims of the National Socialist
regime, as defined by the legislation on care for the victims. The Roma association at
- 251 -

Oberwart was founded in 1989 as a result of the dissatisfaction among Roma youth
with being denied access to places and public events.
Ad “III.6. Romany in the Federal Province of Burgenland“: here one should add that
the remaining funds from the Reconciliation Fund were paid into the Roma Fund, of
which EUR 90,000.00 can be spent every year on educational purposes for pupils,
juveniles and adults belonging to the national minority of the Roma. The funds are
used, inter alia, for the RomBus of the “RomaSerice” association and to promote the
school bus of the association “Roma Oberwart”. An amount of EUR 200,000.00 has
been earmarked for research purposes. The Roma Fund supports the members of
the national minority throughout the national territory.

Advisory Council for the Hungarian National Minority
At its meeting on 7 December 2007 the Advisory Council for the Hungarian National
Minority commented as follows on the draft for a Second Report by the Republic of
Austria in connection with the European Charter for the Minority or Regional
Languages:
It is a concern of the Advisory Council for the Hungarian Minority that on the occasion
of the next increase of the total funding available for promoting the national minorities
a just distribution of the funds is ensured among the six Austrian national minorities,
based on objective, measurable and documented criteria.
