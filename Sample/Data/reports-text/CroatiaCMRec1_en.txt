(Adopted by the Committee of Ministers

at the 765th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies)

The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages;
Bearing in mind the instrument of ratification submitted by the Republic of Croatia on
5 November 1997;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts of the Charter
with respect to the application of the Charter by the Republic of Croatia;
Having taken note of the comments submitted by the Croatian authorities on the
content of the report of the Committee of Experts;
Bearing in mind that this evaluation is based on information submitted by Croatia in
its initial periodical report, supplementary information given by the Croatian
Government, information submitted by bodies and associations legally established in
Croatia, and information obtained by the Committee of Experts during its “on-thespot visit”,
Recommends that the Republic of Croatia take account of all the observations of the
Committee of Experts and, as a matter of priority:
1.
adopt and effectively apply the legal acts and regulations necessary to
implement the existing constitutional provisions and basic statutory acts aimed at
protecting and ensuring the use of regional or minority languages;
2.
establish by legal means an adequate institutional infrastructure for the
teaching in and of the regional or minority languages in accordance with the
obligations of Croatia under Article 8 of the Charter, and in particular provide
sufficient teaching materials and teacher training in regional or minority languages;
3.
create institutional mechanisms that encourage direct participation of the users
of regional or minority languages in planning, funding and organising cultural
activities and in the field of the mass media;
4.
create the necessary legal basis for the official use of regional or minority
languages by state and regional administration as well as in the courts of law and in

particular avoid abdicating to local authorities the choice as to where Articles 9 and
10 of the Charter will be applied;
5.
re-examine the administrative divisions created since 1992 in order to
overcome the obstacles to the promotion of the regional or minority languages created
by these newly established administrative divisions;
6.
strengthen its mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of its
undertakings, thus providing more comprehensive information;
7.
make its periodical reports on the application of the Charter public, thus
ensuring that the organisations and persons concerned are informed of the rights and
duties established under the Charter and its implementation;
8.
provide adequate financing for the measures intended to comply with the
commitments undertaken under the Charter.
