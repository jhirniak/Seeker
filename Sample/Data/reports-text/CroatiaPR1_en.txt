INITIAL REPORT ON THE APPLICATION OF THE
EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL AND MINORITY LANGUAGES

INTRODUCTION

Prior to the proclamation of its independence in 1991, the Republic of Croatia
had throughout the history been a part of different states within which people moved.
As a result, the territory of Croatia is today inhabited by members of other nations
with which Croatia or some of its regions lived in the same state. Hence, Serbian,
Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, German and Austrian minoritites are living on the
territory of the Republic of Croatia as autochtonous minorities. Apart from them,
members of Ruthenian and Ukrainian minority live also in the territory of the
Republic of Croatia. Furthermore, as an autochtonous minority with a traditional
presence, there is also the Jewish community.
According to the 1991 census in the Republic of Croatia, citizens declared
themselves as members of 23 different nationalities, but most of them do not have the
status of a national minority. Members of some nationalities were moving to the
territory of the Republic of Croatia as economic migrants or after the world wars
(Russians, Bulgarians), while a part of autchthonous national minorities was leaving
this area (Italians and Germans after the Second World War).
Except for some short periods when, as a consequence of war situation,
particular minorities were exposed to intollerance (for example, intollerance towards
Italians and Germans after the Second World War resulting in their emigration),
members of minority groups exercised rights of considerable scope in the territory of
the Republic of Croatia.
Thus, even before the proclamation of its independence, the Republic of
Croatia guaranteed in its Constitution the protection of minority rights proclaiming
equality between members of minorities and the majority nation, and introducing
minority languages into official use.
Before the independence, in some municipalities of the Republic of Croatia
Italian, Czech, Hungarian, Slovak, Ruthenian and Ukrainian languages had been in
official use. Besides, that period also saw the education of members of minority
groups in their mother tongue or the provision of additional language and culture
courses, as well as encouregement of realisation of cultural autonomy.
After becoming an independent state, the Republic of Croatia protected the
acquired minority rights.
The Declaration on the Establishment of the Sovereign and Independent
Republic of Croatia, adopted on 25 June 1991 at the session of the Croatian National

3

Parliament guarantees to all national minorities in the territory of the Republic of
Croatia the respect of all the human and civil rights, and particularly the freedom of
expression and fostering of their national language and culture.
The stances contained in the aforesaid document of the Croatian National
Parliament are elaborated in the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms
and the Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of
Croatia (Official Gazette, Nos. 65/91 & 27/92). The provisions od this constitutional
law prescribe the following:
Article 64
In compliance with article 134 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia
and this Law, none of the rights which the Republic of Croatia has adopted directly,
or a s a legal successor of the former Yugoslavia, or is to adopt through international
agreements (the Osimo Agreements and others), shall be altered, annulled or their
realization obstructed.

Article 65
Subject to the principles codified in Articles 34 through 38 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Contract of 1948, the provisions of this Constitutional Law
shall be implemented and interpreted in compliance with the agreements made with
the United Nations.
With reference to bilateral agreements, the Republic of Croatia took over the
Osimo Accords concluded between the former Yugoslavia and the Republic of Italy
which provide for the protection of position of the Italian minority. It also resorted to
making bilateral arrangements for the purpose of regulation of minority rights.
Accordingly, it has concluded special agreements with Italy and Hungary and has
made efforts to regulate this issue also with other states whose minorities live in the
territory of Croatia in the same way as the Croatian minority lives in those states.
The issue of Serbian minority was somehow problematic. Namely, in the
former federal state the position of members of all nations whose states were
particular federal units was equalised. With the independence of the Republic of
Croatia there arose the issue of position of members of nations from the territory of
the former state, with only some of them being autochthonous population in the
territory of the Republic of Croatia.
The position guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and in
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of National
and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia enables them to
receive education in their language or supplementary classes of minority language,
history and culture, to establish minority associations having different purposes,
publish newspapers, magazines, books in the minority language, as well as various
forms of the usage of the minority language before judicial and administrative bodies.

4

With such a tradition and legal situation, the accession to the European
Charter for Regional and Minority Languages did not bring about any essential
changes in the position of minorities.
Certain deficiencies, like for example, the lack of a special law which would
regulate official use of minority languages (the adoption of such law is expected since
it is currently in parliamentary procedure) are due to objective problems faced in the
process of building of democratic social system, and not to unwillingness to regulate
these issues by law. In this regard, one should take into account the fact that
independence of, and transition in Croatia required a complet amendment of the
legislation and its adjustment to the new circumstances. Such a broad legislative
activity which was needed in order to harmonise the overall legislation to the new
circumstances, as well as the need to adapt the legislation to different forms of
integrations to which Croatia aspires or which it has already joined, were the reasons
for which it has not always been possible to make statutory regulation of all aspects of
social life in an appropriate way in such a short period (i.e. in eight years which have
passed since Croatia’s independence). It, therefore, stands to reason that some issues
are still not regulated in an appropriate way and that there is a gap between the
practice and normative regulation of certain issues.

PART I.
1.
In the year 1992, during determination of the final draft of the
European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, the Republic of Croatia
expressed its intention to accede to it once it comes into force.
On its admission to the Council of Europe, the Republic of Croatia undertook
to accede to the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages within one
year.
In October 1997 the Croatian National Parliament passed the Law on
Ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages by which
the Republic of Croatia became the fifth state to ratify the Charter enabling, thus, its
coming into force.
The European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages is in accordance
with Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia which specifies that in
some local units the language or script used by members of minority groups may be
introduced into offical use. It is also in accordance with the Constitutional Law on
Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or
Minorities in the Republic of Croatia which elaborates such rights in Articles 7 and 8.
Furthermore, Article 15 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia
guarantees to all members of minorities full equality, freedom to express their
nationality, freedom to use their language and script and cultural autonomy.
In addition, Articles 5 to 17 of the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and
Freedoms and the Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the

5

Republic of Croatia guarantee to the members of minorities the protection of their
cultural heritage, encouragement of cultural creativity, freedom to use their signs and
symbols and education in their language.
We would like to point out that the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and
the above- mentioned Constitutional Law prescribe that the right to education in
minority languages and the right to official use of mother tongue shall be regulated in
accordance with a separate law.
Education in minority languages is still realised on the basis of the laws of the
former Socialist Republic of Croatia adopted before the independence because the
new legislation has not been passed yet.
The right to official use of minority languages was in the former state
regulated by a regulation passed by the Executive Council of the Parliament (the
body which in the former system of unity of powers would correspond to the
Government in the system of separation of powers) and by a series of regulations
governing proceedings conducted before judicial and administrative authorities.
Nowadays, the Civil Proceedings Act, the Criminal Proceedings Act and the
General Administrative Proceedings Act are applied, while the new law which would
regulate comprehensively and in one place all forms of official use of minority
languages has still not been passed. This Bill is currently in legislative proceedings in
the Croatian National Parliament.
The Constitution adopted in the year 1991 and the Local Self-Government and
Administration Act, 1992 allowed for the establishment of a system of local selfgovernment in which municipalities and cities were granted powers to regulate
autonomously some issues in their area and to regulate the way of functioning of
their authorities. Consequently, some minicipalities and cities in which members of
minority groups exercised their rights before, prescribed by their statutes the use of
minority languages on their territories. However, a decision made by local authorities
about the introduction of a minority language into official use does not apply to the
procedures conducted by state administration bodies and courts. Such bodies apply
the aforesaid procedural laws which ensure that members of minorities may use their
languages while participating in all these proceedings.
In particular, we would like to emphasise that the Republic of Croatia has
committed itself to making bilateral arrangements on the status of minorities with
their motherlands. The agreements with Italy and Hungary have already been signed.
Moreover, endeavours are made to regulate bilaterally the position of other minorities,
especially because there are ethnic Croats in the majority of motherlands of some
minorities (for example, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Austria).
2.
In accordance with the Historical Foundations of the Constitution of
the Repub lic of Croatia in which some of autochthonous minorities are explicitly
stated, the Republic of Croatia undertook to apply the European Charter for Regional
and Minority Languages to the Serbian, Italian, Hungarian, Czech, Slovak, Ruthenian
and Ukrainian languages. Such an obligation was made because these autochthonous
minorities are concentrated in substantial numbers in particular areas.

6

For example, members of the Italian minority are concentrated mostly in the
territory of the Istarska County, members of the Czech minority in the territory of the
Bjelovarsko-bilogorska County, while members of the Hungarian, Slovak, Ruthenian
and Ukrainian minority are concentrated in the Osjecko-baranjska County and the
Vukovarsko-srijemska County. The Serbian minority lives mainly dispersed over the
whole territory of the Republic of Croatia, while only its smaller was concentrated in
some parts of a number of counties (Šibensko-kninska, Zadarska, Licko-senjska,
Karlovacka and Sisacko-moslavacka Counties).
Such a situation was changed during the war in Croatia when members of nonSerbian minorities together with Croats were forced out of the occupied parts of the
Bjelovarsko-bilogorska, Osjecko-baranjska and Vukovarsko-srijemska counties. It
also changed after the war when members of the Serbian minority left the previously
occupied areas and settled partly in the areas of the Osjecko-baranjska and
Vukovarsko-srijemska counties which were under
the administration of the
UNTAES.
The number of members of a particular minority in the areas traditionally
inhabited by such minority in the past will considerably depend on the
implementation of the process of return of displaced persons in the said areas.
Anyway, it is important to emphasise that the territorial distribut ion of minorities
which has been subject to major changes will be known with certainty only after the
new census is conducted, since the 1991 census (conducted before the war in Croatia)
is in some parts no longer relevant for the above stated reasons.
3.
For the purpose of Article 1, Paragraph (a) of the European Charter for
Regional and Minority Languages, and in accordance with the 1991 census conducted
in the territory of the Republic of Croatia, out of Croatia’s total population
(4.784.265) there were 652.396 members of other nations who exercised some of the
rights related to the use of their own language.
In accordance with the 1991 census, national composition of members of
minorities was the following:
Czechs
Hungarians
Germans
Ruthenians
Slovaks
Serbs
Italians
Ukrainians

13.086
22.355

-2.845

It is pointed out that in the Republic of Croatia there are also some other
national groups which, due to their small number and dispersion over the whole of the
state territory, do not exercise special minority rights at the level of particular units of
local self- government.

7

4.
In the Republic of Croatia there are no territorial languages for the
purpose of Article 1, Paragraph (c) of the European Charter for Regional and Minority
Languages.
5.
In the Republic of Croatia there is no special body which would deal
exclusively with the special protection of minority languages, but such protection is
provided by the bodies founded for the purpose of protection of human rights and
rights of national minorities.
Namely, the Republic of Croatia makes special efforts to build the system of
protection of human rights, which is separately elaborated in the reports on the
application of particular international documents. As to the Council of Europe
documents, we would like to refer you to the Report on the application of the
Framowork Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.
It would be important to stress that within the state bodies there is the
Committee on Human Rights and Rights of National Minorities of the Croatian
National Parliament’s House of Representatives with its Subcommittee on Exercise
of Minority Rights, as well as the Government’s Coordinating Body for Internal
Policy and Human Rights which monitors the exercise of all minority rights,
including the protection of minority languages.
Furthermore, there are 34 minority associations in Croatia gathering both the
members of autochthonous minorities and members of other nations living nowadays
in the territory of Croatia.
All these associations co-operate with the Government Office for National
Minorities through which Government offers its support to the programmes of such
associations and which provides for the co-operation with the state bodies regarding
the exercise of particular minority rights (cultural autonomy, promotion of different
forms of preservation of cultural singularities).
Moreover, minority rights are protected as the rights guaranteed by the
Constitution through the Constitutional Court and the Ombudsma n.

8

PART II.
1.
With reference to the application of Article 7 of the Charter, on the
ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages the
Republic of Croatia made reservation to Paragraph 5 of Article 7 since the Republic
of Croatia does not apply it to non-territorial languages.
With respect to Paragraphs 1 to 4 of Article 7, we would like to point out that
the above mentioned provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and of
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of National
and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia ensure the freedom
of private and public use od minority languages and cultural autonomy of members of
minorities. In such a way, this aspect of minority rights is protected from institutional
interference of any kind and it does not require any further statutory regulation.
However, for introduction of a minority language into official use the decision
of the assemby of the local self- government unit is needed, but to be more specific,
only in cases when members of such minority do not constitute majority of the whole
population living in the territory of that local self- government unit.
If the members of a particular minority group are in majority in the territory of
a local self- government unit, official use of the minority language is obligatory under
Article 7 of the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of
National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia
The decision of the assembly of a local self- government unit (city or
municipality) binds all its bodies. The Draft Law on Official Use of the Language and
Script Used by Members of Minorities in the Republic of Croatia provides that the
decision of the assembly of a municipality or city which has introduced a minority
language or script into official use is also obligatory for state administration bodies
and courts having territorial jurisdiction for that municipality or city.
The said Constitutional Law promotes protection and preservation of cultural
singularities of minorities either by providing them with the education in minority
language, by ensuring the study of minority language and culture, as well as by
encouraging their relations with their ethnic motherland. It particularly became
prominent in agreements on protection of minorities concluded with Italy and
Hungary.
Financing of cultural and other activities of minorities is provided through the
Office for Minorities.
2.
The Government of the Republic of Croatia intends to propose
statutory regulation of education of persons belonging to minorities, and to go on with
the efforts in the field of bilateral regulation of the position of members of minorities.
The adoption of the Official Use of Minority Languages Act is expected to
take place soon and by such adoption the system of protection of minority languages
will be rounded off.

9

Furthermore, special efforts are made in order to promote co-operation with
minority associations, especially through the Office for Minorities of the Government
of the Republic of Croatia. The State Budget provides funds by which the
Government offers assistance and supports the activities of minority associations,
publication of newspapers and other forms of minorities’ cultural autonomy. For this
purpose, 25,288,000.00 kunas have been allocated for different programmes of
minority associations for the year 1999.

PART III.
In the introductory part of this Report it is stated that the Republic of Croatia
accepted the same provisions for all minorities with respect to which it assumed
obligation to apply the Charter. In this way all minorities are provided with the same
level of rights, and individual minorities are not mentioned separately.
At the same time, Article 5 of the Law on Ratification of the European Charter
for Regional and Minority Languages regulates that the Charter applies to the territory
of those municipalities and cities which have introduced minority languages into
official use in accordance with Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Croatia and with Articles 7 and 8 of the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and
Freedoms and the Rights of National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the
Republic of Croatia.
In practice, other rights (apart from the right to official use of a minority
language) are applied in any area in which a particular need of members of minorities
is articulated (supplementary classes of minority language, cultural activities, and the
like).

Article 8 – Education
a) Chosen provisions
Paragraph 1

Subparagraph (a) Item (iii)
Subparagraph (b) Item (iv)

Subparagraph (d) Item (iv)
Subparagraph (e) Item (ii)
Subparagraph (f) Item (ii)
Subparagraph (g)
Subparagraph (h)

b) Measures undertaken for the implementation of the chosen provisions
Having respect for general human principles and values of education as an
intercultural and civilizational activity among nations, considering that bilingualism
and multilingualism are indispensable and desirable social phenomena in the

10

strengthening of European integrations, and considering that realisation of minority
rights, achieved by promotion of tolerance, human rights and civil education, is the
task which is most naturally accomplishable by means of education, the Republic of
Croatia proclaimed that the right to education which involves studying the script,
history and culture in a regional and minority language is a key component of its
educational system aimed at the preservation of identity and existence of a national or
ethnic community or minority in the whole territory of the Republic of Croatia. By
means of observance of the right to one’s own language, history and culture which is
a fundamental human right, the above education contributes to the maintenance and
development of European wealth and tradition, and it is particularly realised by the
following constitutional and legal provisions:
1. The Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of
National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia
1. The Law on Upbringing and Education in Languages of Minorites
It stemms from the above listed legal documents that in the Republic of
Croatia regional and minority languages are governed by:
- The Law on Upbringing and Education in Languages of Nationalities from 1979,
which is an integral part of the constitutional right in accordance with Article 64 of
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of Natio nal
and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia and which is
derived from Article 134 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia stating that
none of the rights which have been taken over by the Republic of Croatia directly or
as a legal successor of the former SFRY, or which will be taken over by international
agreements (for example, Osimo Accords), can be amended or abolished, nor can
their exercise be restricted;
-

programmes of educational co-operation with foreign countries (Republic of
Hungary, Republic of Austria);
protocols of educational and cultural co-operation (Federal Republic of Germany,
etc.)
the Law on European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. It has been
adopted and it ratified the Charter. Consequently, the Charter, having been an
international agreement concluded, ratified and published in accordance with the
Constitution must, in accordance with Article 134 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Croatia, be considered a part of the Republic of Croatia’s internal
legal order being above law in terms of legal effects.

In distinction from officially recognised minorities, members of nations which
constituted the former Yugoslavia (SFRY) and who lived in the Republic of Croatia
did not have the status of regional and national minorities (nationalities), and
therefore did not have neither special organisations nor special schools in their
language. However, those students whose national script was the Cyrillic script and
which were in majority in some schools were taught Cyrillic script in the first place as
an initial script, while the Latin script was introduced in the 3rd grade, and vice versa.

11

The basic legal regulation by virtue of which the European Charter for
Regional and Minority Languages is applied is the Law on the Upbringing ands
Education in Languages of Nationalities (Official Gazette No. 25 of 9 June 1979).

Number of speakers of regional and minority languages
It is not possible to indicate the number of persons speaking a particular
regional or minority language. The criterion for the definition of “persons speaking a
regional or minority language” in the Republic of Croatia would still be the statistical
data from the 1991 census. Although official, these data are not authoritative because
they do not take into account the new demographic situation created after the
Homeland War in the Republic of Croatia.
Other languages-German, Hebrew, Roma
By Article 4 of the Law on Ratification of the European Charter for Regional
and Minority Languages, the Republic of Croatia made, in accordance with Article 21
Paragraph 1 of the Charter, reservation with respect to application of Paragraph 5 of
Article 7 of the Charter (relating to non-territorial languages).
However, the Republic of Croatia, i.e. the Ministry of Education and Sports, in
compliance with the obligations arising from bilateral international agreements (FR
Germany, Austria) and following the initiatives from the practice taken either
autonomously (Jews) or in co-operation with, or through the Office for National
Minorities of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (Roma), provides, both in
administrative terms and financially, for speakers and associations of speakers of the
above languages, and it also facilitates the realisation of their needs.
In the territory of the Republic of Croatia there are following publishing
institutions which publish books and publications in minority languages:
-

Newspaper publishing house “Jednota”
“Edit” –newspaper publishing house
Serbian Cultural Society “P rosvjeta”

All relevant factors involved in the application of the European Charter for
Regional and Minority Languages have been informed about the adoption of the Law
on Ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. There
were no initiatives nor needs for formulation of special guidelines intended for
educational institutions with respect to the implementation and application of the
Charter in practice because its application is unobstructed and under control of the

12

local self- governemnt authorities. Moreover, just through the application of the
Charter, all interested parties in the Croatian Danubian Region contributed, by giving
examples of good practice, to the integration processes in the educational system of
the Republic of Croatia.
The expected decentralisation at all levels in the Republic of Croatia will
undoubtedly have positive effects on the local self- government and the educational
system of Croatia, because it will enable the establishment of information
mechanisms and the appointing of persons responsible for systematic follow-up and
implementation of the Charter in accordance with the internationally accepted
obligations of the Republic of Croatia.
The solutions made in accordance with the objectives and princip les of the
Charter are built in and implemented in the educational system and especially in
different school regulations and curricula, as well as at the level of organisation and
work of schools in minority languages.
Although the new “Law on Education in Minority Languages” has still not
been adopted in Croatia, there are laws which cover these issues, and particularly the
Law on the Upbringing and Education in Languages of Nationalities from 1979 and
the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and of the Rights of National
and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia, 1991. These laws
regulate in detail the following: rights to education, establishment of schools and
classes in which instruction is held in a minority language and the rights to minorityrelated components in educational programmes. Besides, the Republic of Croatia
applies the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages which also
regulates the use of minority and regional languages.
a) A minority language is, in all school environments in which it is used,
treated as an expression of cultural wealth and an advantage for general progress.
b) The integrity of the geographical area of a regional or minority language is
not an issue to be dealt with by schools and that is why we do not mention it in school
reports. Most geographical areas (settlements) in Croatia in which the education in
minority languages has been introduced in general or by formation of separate
minority language classes has actually the Croatian majority. However, this fact does
not prevent the school institutions from making possible to all interested children to
be educated in their language, even in case of languages which are not covered by the
Charter.
c) Minority languages are promoted in the school system as a linguistic and
cultural phenomenon, and there are no problems with this. However, some problems
arise at another level (political level) when in some environments (especially in the
borderline areas) a minority language is treated as an instrument of political
mobilisation and separatism with a view to achieving autonomy of school institutions
on the basis of language, which is not in accordance with the European Charter for
Regional and Minority Languages nor with the existing regulations governing the
establishment of school institutions in the Republic of Croatia. The same applies to
cultural links with other groups.

13

d) The education and instruction in minority languages is organised at all
levels of the educational system when some basic requirements have been satisfied.
The most important ones are sufficient number of interested persons and of members
of staff. Such requirements exist in pre-school, primary and secondary education and
at all these levels education in a minority language is organised, provided that the said
requirements are fulfilled.
e) We have no information about official links between the groups which use
minority or regional languages. However, state administration services encourage the
examples of good practice, for example, self- initiated organisation of the “nonterritorial” German language in the territory of the Osjecko-baranjska County or a
high level of publishing activities in the Italian minority language in the Istarska
County.
f) The internal organisation of all bodies and activities in the state
administration is subject to changes arising from international obligations of the
Republic of Croatia, as well as from the forthcoming European integrations.
g) For the above listed reasons, and especially because of the feelings of the
population brought about by the aggression against Croatia, Croatia has not had the
opportunity to provide facilities enabling non-speakers of minority language to go to
schools in particular minority languages. However, in some Croatian schools persons
who do not employ a minority language are offered possibility to take that language
as an optional subject in school.
In the educational system the principle of equality of all persons is respected
and applied, regardless of the language (majority or minority) in which they receive
education (equivalence of school certificates-diplomas, undisturbed transfer to other
schools, national representativeness of the staff, relations between students, bilingual
inscriptions wherever the law requires so and the like).
The basic principle in Croatian educational system is the principle which
implies that all educational institutions in the Republic of Croatia are Croatian schools
in which, in accordance with constitutional provisions, instruction is given in the
official Croatian standard language. The principle of voluntarinness and freedom of
choice is applied by means of special rights arising from the constitutional principles
and from special laws adopted by the Republic of Croatia relating to the introduction
of instruction in minority language and formation of classes to receive such
instruction, as well as to the introduction of special components in education for
speakers of minority or regional languages. There is no administrative coercion, nor
ghettoisation. Each minority group having appropriate number of students who wish
to receive instruction and follow programmes in their (minority) language can realise
their interests within the existing schools system. The appropriate number of students
is determined after consultation with the minority community and it relates to the
number of students in one class, which in practice may be even three times less than
the number established for regular classes of schools in which education is held in the
Croatian language.
In the Republic of Croatia there are examples of good practice when nongovernmental organisations or associations of speakers of minority or regional

14

languages express their needs or give their comments or make requests to all state
institutions, from the local self- government bodies and local and state administration
bodies to the Croatian National Parliament in which national minorities have their
elected representatives. There is also a special office with the Government of the
Republic of Croatia through which all concerned state administration bodies must
resolve all issues relating to a particular regional or minority language.

2.

Application of the Charter in the Croatian Danubian Region
- Separate assessment of the Osjecko-baranjska County

All schools in the Croatian Danubian Region in the Osjecko-baranjska County
bilingual have plates containing text in the Croatian and Serbian languages, as well as
in the Croatian and Hungarian languages, and in the localities of Jelisavac and
Josipovac Punitovacki in the Croatian and Slovak languages. In this way the Republic
of Croatia has respected the highest interests of the national minorities residing there.
After the re-establishment of the Croatian authorities’ rule in the whole
territory of the Republic of Croatia, and in accordance with the Agreement between
the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the UNTAES, for the schools in the
Osjecko-baranjska County in the school year 1997/98 all necessary bilingual
pedagogical and students’documentation was printed.
In accordance with all agreements concluded between the Government of the
Republic of Croatia and the UNTAES, and on the basis of the existing legal
regulations, all activities have been carried out for the purpose of safeguarding the
interests of minorities in the field of education. Parents, local and state administration
authorities have not reported any case of discrimination, which means that students
have been enabled to enrol in the classes and programmes in the minority languages
carried out by teachers who belong to the national minority concerned. After the end
of the school year students receive documents which are equivalent to the documents
received by the students of the Croatian nationality.
On several occasions the state authorities had to intervene in cases of
discrimination against the students of the Croatian nationality. Their rights were
violated when teachers giving instruction in the Serbian language denied their right to
use the Croatian language and the Latin script, or when bilingual inscription plates
were broken (Primary School “Jagodnjak” and Primary School “Dalj”). Chauvinist
behaviour exhibited against the Croatian population was reported in the Primary
School “Tenja”, Primary School “Draž” and Primary School “Beli Manastir”.
One of the measures taken by the Republic of Croatia in order to maintain
stability and facilitate re- integration process in the above- mentioned region is the
maintenance of employment status of teachers of Serbian nationality although they
have become redundant. In this way, 35 such teachers receive salary without working
even one hour a week, while 65 of them work on a reduced work norm.
Within the framework of the existing curriculum of the Republic of Croatia it
was made possible for the speakers of minority or regional languages to modify the
curriculum in the part relating to subjects with national elements. Apart from

15

receiving instruction in their mother tongue, students have been enabled to attend
supplementary classes of mother tongue and to foster their national culture.
Laws and regulations specify the minimum number of students in one class.
However, in case of formation of classes for students belonging to minorities it was
decided to apply much lower minimum than the regulations specify. This was done
for the purpose of protecting the broadest interests of members of minority groups and
it, undoubtedly, makes realisation of educational process much more expensive.
The Ministry of Education and Sports has provided for the translation of
current school books for the group of subjects with national elements into the
language of particular minority, while the printing of school books for other subjects
is under way.
Primary schools students receive, according to the criteria established by the
Ministry of Education and Sports, school books free of charge. However, there is a
problem with secondary school students in the Croatian Danubian Region who can
not buy school books, and only about 30% of them have proper books (with 70% of
them attending classes without school books).
The level of participation of qualified staff in education in regional or
minority languages is relatively good both in primary and secondary schools.
With respect to some subjects (foreign language, arts, technical subjects in
secondary school), the education is not covered by qualified staff. However, this
situation is not characteristic only of the Danubian Region, it applies to overall
education in the Republic of Croatia.
Paragraph 1:
Subparagraph (a), Item (iii). - It was implemented in all places where it was
necessary to do so.
Organisation of pre-school-education falls within the competence of local selfgovernment authorities. Education and training are carried out in accordance with the
Pre-School Education and Training Act (Official Gazette, No. 10/97).

organised for the purpose of training assistants in the process of integration of Roma
population in the educational system of the Republic of Croatia.

General comment:
- Educational plan and programme in the Czech language is realised without major difficulties.
- The biggest problems with which teachers are faced are problems related with the availability of appropriate school books. Namely, there are
still no new schoolbooks (some reading books date back to the 70- ies) which would cover the changes that took place in the Republic of
Croatia.
- In the school year 1998/99 18 hours a week in the class-based instruction are no t covered by qualified staff. The primary school in Dežanovac
has four times announced job vacancy, but no qualified teachers applied.
- The Ministry of Education and Sports has given its consent for arrival of a Czech teacher fully supported by the Czech Republic.

a) Chosen provisions
Paragraph 1

Subparagraph (a), Items (ii) and (iv)
Subparagraph (b), Items (ii) and (iii)
Subparagraph (c), Items (ii) and (iii)
Subparagraph (d)

b) Measures undertaken for the implementation of the chosen provisions
Laws regulating civil and criminal proceedings provide for the protection of the right
of persons belonging to minorities to use their language before the court. These issuse are
governed by the following legal provisions:

The Law on Civil Procedure
Article 6
The civil proceedings shall be conducted in the Croatian language and with the
use of the Latin script, unless for particular courts the use of another language or
script is provided by the law.

Article 102
Parties and participants in the proceedings shall be entitled to use their own
language when participating in the hearings and when undertaking other procedural
actions orally. If particular proceedings are not conducted in the language of a party
or of another participant in the proceedings, arrangements shall be made in order to
ensure that everything stated at the hearing, as well as all documents used at the
hearing as an evidence, are interpreted to such persons into their language.
Parties and other participants in the proceedings shall be informed about their
right to follow the oral proceedings before the court in their own language, with the
assistance of an interpreter. They may waive the right to interpretation if they speak
the language in which the proceedings are conducted.
In the minutes it shall be recorded that such information was given to a party
or participant. The minutes shall also contain the party’s or participant’s statement
about it.
Interpretation shall be performed by ceritified interpreters.

Article 103
Writs of summons, rulings and other writings delivered to the parties and other
participants in the proceedings shall be in the Croatian language and in the Latin
script.
If another language or script is also in official use, the court shall submit court
writings in such language or script to those parties and participants who use them in
the proceedings. Parties and other participants in the proceedings may require that
court writings be submitted to them in the language in which the proceedings are
conducted.

Article 105
The costs of interpretation into a minority language incurred because of the
application of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia or of this Act, as well as of
any other law governing the right of members of minority groups to use their
language, shall be borne by the court.

The Law on Criminal Procedure
Article 7
In the criminal proceedings the Croatian language and the Latin script shall be
used, unless also another language or script has been introduced for some judicial
areas by law.
Parties, witnesses and other participants in the proceedings shall be entitled to
use their own language. If a procedural action is not conducted in the language of
such a person, provision shall be made for interpretation of his/her or other person’s
statements as well as of documents and other written materials of evidence.
Interpretation shall be done by a certified interpreter.
The person referred to in Paragraph 2 of this Article shall be informed about
the right to interpretation and he/she can waive this right in case he/she speaks the
language in which the proceedings are conducted. It shall be recorded in the minutes
that such information was given. The participant’s statement shall also be recorded in
the minutes.
Writs of summons and decisions shall be delivered in the Croatian language
and in the Latin script. Motions, appeals and other submissions shall be forwarded to
the court in the Croatian language and in the Latin script. If in a particular judicial
area also another language or script has been introduced into official use by law,
submissions may be forwarded to the court in that language too. After the
commencement of the trial, the person who has forwarded submission may not revoke
his/her decision about the language he/she will use in the proceedings without the
permission of the court.

30

To an arrested person, to an accused person who is in custody and to a person
serving his/her sentence, writs of summons, decision and other writings shall be
delivered in the language he/she uses in the proceedings.
A foreigner in custody may, during the trial, forward to the court submissions
in his/her own language. As to the period before or after the trial, such submissions
shall be made only under the condition of reciprocity.
Article 367, Subparagraph 3
A substantial violation of the provisions of criminal procedure shall be
established:
3)
if the trial was conducted without the presence of a person whose presence at
the trial is obligatory by law, or if an accused person, defence attorney, injured party
appearing as plaintiff or plaintiff have, contrary to their request, been denied the right
to use their own language at the trial and to follow the course of the hearing in that
language.
Court’s Rules of Practice
Article 88, Paragraph 2
Originals of all court decisions, settlements and other acts shall be kept in a
respective court file. Such documents shall be delivered to the parties in a certified
copy or certified translation, if the request for issuing of a decision in a minority
language of a national minority is based on the law or international agreement.

Regulations governing the work of courts do not provide for separate recording of the
number of cases in which the above provisions were applied. For the purpose of this Report,
we have gathered information about the use of particular minority languages in the court
proceedings in the year 1997, since the information for the year 1998 is still not available. We
would like to point out that such data refer mostly to the period before the Law on
Ratification of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages entered into force
and that in the Croatian Danubian Region (parts of the Osjecko-baranjska County and of the
Vukovarsko-srijemska County) the process of peaceful re- integration and of re-establisment
of the legal system of the Republic of Croatia was under way at that time.
- Italian language
Istarska County:
County Court in Pula
Municipality Court in Pula
Municipality Court in Buje

-

the Italian language was used in 19 proceedings
the Italian language was used in 5 proceedings
the Italian language was used in 14 proceedings

At the Municipal Courts in Rovinj and Buje the knowledge of the Italian language is
taken into account when employing new staff. The President of the Municipality Court in
Rovinj and one judge at that court are members of the Italian minority.
31

- Hungarian language
Osjecko-baranjska County:
At the Municipality Court in Beli Manastir one judge and five court clerks are
members of the Hungarian minority. It is emphasised that the area falling within the
jurisdiction of this court was an occupied territory and relevant information will, therefore, be
available only for the future reports.
In particular, we would like to stress that members of minorities have had no
objections regarding the use of their language in court proceedings.

Paragraph 1, Subparagraphs (a) and (c)
As it has already been mentioned, the Croatian National Parliament is currently
conducting a procedure for the the adoption of a special law which would regulate in an
integral manner the official use of minority languages in the proceedings before state
authorities, including administrative authorities. The following regulations are applied now:
Constitution of the Republic of Croatia

32

Article 12
The Croatian language and the Latin script shall be in official use in the
Republic of Croatia.
In individual local units another language and the Cyrillic or some other script
may be introduced into official use along with the Croatian language and with the
Latin sctipt, under conditions specified by law.

Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and of the Rights of
National and Ethnic Communities or Minorities in the Republic of Croatia
Article 7
Members of all ethnic and national communities or minorities in the Republic
of Croatia shall be entitled to free use of their language and script in private and
public life.
In the municipalities where members of an ethnic and national community or
minority are in majority with respect to the total population, the language and script of
that etninc and national community or minority shall, along with the Croatian
language and Latin script, be in official use.

Article 8
Units of local self- government may prescribe that two or more languages and
scripts are in official use, due account being taken of the number of members and
interests of ethnic and national communities or minorities.

The Law on General Administrative Procedure
Article 15
(1) Administrative procedings shall be conducted in the language and script
being in the official use by the authority before which such proceedings are
conducted.
(2) Members of all minorities shall be guaranteed the freedom to use their own
language and script in the administrative proceedings, under the conditions
determined by a separate law.

It is separately pointed out that the use of a minority language is to be borne
by the authority before which the proceedings in the minority languge are conducted.
33

These provisions provide for full application of the chosen provisions (from the
Charter) when a member of minority appears as a party before a municipality or city
authority in those municipalities and cities which have introduced a particular minority
language into official use.

- Paragraph (a)
Until the aforesaid law is adopted, the situation with respect to the state administration
authorities will be somewhat different.
In the areas covered by bilateral agreements (this refers mostly to the members of the
Italian minority in the Istarska County in the cities of Buje and Umag, as well as in the
municipalities of Brtonigla, Grožnjan, Novigrad) state administration authorities use either
the Croatian or the Italian language, according to the choice of the party (on the basis of the
Osimo Accords concluded between the Italy and the former Yugoslavia and afterwards
adopted by the Republic of Croatia, as well as on the basis of the Agreement on Minority
Rights concluded between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Italy).
In other areas and with respect to other minorities, a party may participate in the
proceedings using his/her own language, with the assistance of an interpreter, and receive
answer in translation if he/she requests so. Members of minorities may exercise these rights
in the following areas in a way established by the statutes of the local self- government units:

County, the total number of issued identity cards in two languages is 15 097 and this number
also includes the number of identity cards replaced by a person due to the change of data
(expiry, the change of name, the change of residence, etc.)
Subparagraph g)
In all municipalities and towns which introduced the official use of the language of
the minority for the whole area, all names of settlements, streets, squares, geographical names
etc. are written in two languages.
If the language of the minority is officially used for only a part of a settlement as
members of the minority are concentrated only in that area, there is a possibility of the
official use of the language of the minority only for the area of that settlement.
At the moment there are no special regulations which determine this, but such
solutions were the result of the long tradition of the use of the languages of the minority.
Paragraph 3, Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c)
Regarding public services, most of them were organised by units of local selfgovernment. In these cases, the above mentioned is applied to the units of local selfgovernment, i.e. bodies of government administration.

Paragraph 5
Personal Name Act
Article 6
Every person has the right to change his name.
The request for the change of the name has to mention reasons for the change
of the name and the suggestion of the new name must justify that request.
The competent general administration body in the place of residence of the
applicant decides on the request of the change of the name.
Article 8
The change of the name will be approved when the request is considered to be
justified after the body has determined that the new name does not oppose social rules
and customs of the environment in which the person lives.
The Personal Name Act regulates the procedure for determining names of Croatian
citizens.

45

According to the regulations of the mentioned law a child has the surname of one or
both parents and parents have chosen the whole personal name (name and surname) by
consent. However, the mentioned law determines the right of citizens to change their name.
Article 6 of the mentioned law determines that every person has the right to change
his/her personal name.
The competent general administration body in the place of residence of the applicant
decides on the request of the change of the name.
Article 8 of the mentioned law regulates that the change of the personal name will be
approved when the request is considered to be justified after the body has determined that the
new name does not oppose social rules and customs of the environment in which the person
lives.
It is true that the mentioned law does not specially regulate the realisation of the right
to the change of the personal name or determination of the name for members of the national
minority. However, in everyday life the names are changed according to the nationality,
which is particularly evident in decisions on the change of personal names. Requests for the
change of the personal name are explained by the fact that they want to have the name typical
for the nationality they belong to, i.e. they want their name to be written in its original from.
As an example, we mention changes of names of members of Hungarian minority (Stjepan –
Ištvan; Horvat – Horvath, Laslo – Laszlo, Kovac – Kovacs) and the more frequent is the
change of personal name for members of Italian national minority, who usually want their
name to be written in Italian. There were also cases when members of the German national
minority changed their name according to the surname of their ancestors. For example, Vuk –
Wolf; Glumac – Schauspiller; Heinzel, etc.
There is no data that any member of the national minority was denied the change of
the personal name according to nationality.

1. In applying these provisions of the European Charter for Regional and Minority
Languages in the Telecommunications Act (“Official Gazette”, No. 53/94) there is a
possibility that radio stations which broadcast radio or television programme, can under
certain conditions, broadcast a programme in the language of the ethnic and national
community or minority (Article 64 of the Telecommunications Act).
It has to be indicated that the Telecommunication Act provides for a possibility for
legal persons (companies) with headquarters in the Republic of Croatia to perform radio and
television activities upon obtaining concession of the Council for Telecommunications, with
such possibility being actually implemented in practice.
The mentioned law enables radio and television activities at the state and the local
level (the level of town, county, town of Zagreb or group of counties).
The Council for Telecommunications announces competitions for granting
concessions for performing radio and television activities after technical conditions are met
(Article 13, Paragraph 1 and Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Act).
The concession can be given to a legal person who proves in her offer that can realise
programme, technical, technological, spatial, financial and personnel conditions and that the
offered domestic programme will satisfy public interest in the best possible way (Article 14,
Paragraph 5 of the Act).
Respecting the provision of the Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the European Charter “the
principle of the independence and autonomy of the media”, the Telecommunications Act
regulates programme-related criteria, special programme conditions, which do not limit the
freedom of speech or of expressing opinion in any way (Articles 56 – 66 of the
Telecommunications Act).
Moreover, the provision of Article 58 of the Telecommunications Act says that state
bodies and their representatives must not influence the radio and television concessionaire
regarding the creation of the programme and that not a single provision of that law can be
interpreted in a way to enable a censorship or limitation of the right to speech and expressing
opinion.
Regarding the provision on the use of the language, the Telecommunications Act
regulates only the obligation of broadcasting radio and television programme in the Croatian

51

language, with the exception regarding broadcasting of programmes in Croatian language
dialects or in the language of the ethnic community or minority.
The mentioned exception is only a possibility, not an obligation (Article 64 of the
Telecommunications Act).
While considering offers for granting radio and television concessions regarding the
given programme, the Council for Telecommunications need not consider them regarding the
representation of programmes in the languages of national communities or minorities and
need not require data on it in announcements.
That is why we do not have data on the representation of languages of national
communities or minorities in the programmes of radio and television concessionaires and this
body of state authority is not authorised to ask for these data.
In order to understand better the provisions of the Telecommunications Act which
regulate radio and television activities, we would like to indicate that these activities can only
be performed by companies and that this activity represents the economic activity which is
done on a commercial basis, which means that such companies must ensure that their
programmes make a profit, so that they can ensure as high as possible income after all
financial obligations have been fulfilled.
On the other hand, a radio and television concession can be performed by a company
whose owners, according to the Telecommunications Act, must be at least four legal or
individual persons. Among them there are certainly members of national minorities, although
there are no data on it, as all citizens are equal according to this Act, regardless of their
nationality.
We would like to stress that today 110 companies perform radio activities and 10 of
them perform television activities and we think that it is the best proof of the most immediate
involvement and influence of a large number of individual and legal persons (and also
representatives of national communities and minorities) in the creation of radio and television
programme, both at the state and at the local level.
So, the owners of companies, radio concessionaires are over 347 legal and over 3.001
individuals, while the owners of companies, television concessionaires are 60 legal and 59
individual persons.
Therefore, we think that the provision of Article 11, Paragraph 1 of the European
Charter is carried out in the previously mentioned provision of the Telecommunications Act.
The following is an overview of the programme for minorities on the national television:
Croatian Radio Television: produces and broadcasts a programme intended for providing
information to national minorities in Croatia which is broadcasted mostly on the First and
Second Porgramme of the Croatian Radio Television in the form of special shows and news
stories. Among others, the following programmes are involved in the production: the
Information Programme, the Religious Culture Programme and partly the Entertainment
Programme. However, all programmes of the Croatian Television, although having specific
orientation, refer to and cover minority-related topics when such topics come to the centre of
public attention.
52

Information Programme: A special programme for national minorities is broadcasted
by the multi- national newsmagazine “Prizma” (“The Prism”). The duration of this
programme is 50 minutes, and in the year 1998, 40 broadcasts are planned, resulting in 2.000
minutes of programme. The table below contains information about the “Prizma”
newsmagazine for the period from autumn 1997 to 28 November 1998.

Besides, 32 studio interviews with members of national minorities have been
broadcasted. The broadcast lasts for 50 minutes and in the reporting period a total of 45
broadcasts was made.
Within its programme scheme for the year 1999, the Croatian television will, at the
proposal of the Committee for Human Rights and the Rights of National Minorities of the
Croatian National Parliament’s Chamber of Deputies, as well as at the proposal of the
representatives of national minorities, broadcast autonomous TV “kornik” of national
minorities which they will create by themselves and edit with the assistance of television
experts.
Daily information programme: short news, as well as news stories about national
minorities are, when they are included in the informative and daily shows, broadcasted in
“Dnevnik” (“Daily News”), “Motrišta” (“Standpoint”), “Vijesti” (“News”) and “Hrvatska
danas” (“Croatia Today”).
The regional programme is broadcasted in the show “Županijska panorama” (“The
County Panorama”) from Zagreb, Bjelovar, Varaždin, Rijeka, Osijek and Split. Throughout
the whole year it provides information of regional relevance, thematically different,
informing the public about 2.120, which makes about 53.160 minutes of programme. In late
1997 the “Televizija Dunav” (“Danube Television”) started from Television Centres Vukovar
and Beli Manastir to broadcast one- hour Saturday and Sunday programmes and half-an- hour
news programmes five days a week in the Serbian language. In 1998 these media received
support from the State Budget for their activities.

2. Regarding Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the European Charter which refers to the
“reception of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a minority or
regional language”, it is indicated that the Telecommunications Act determines that the radio
concessionaire can, together with its programme, regularly or from time to time as a whole,
broadcast certain shows of a foreign programme with the consent of the Council for
Telecommunications,
This possibility has not been used by radio and television concessionaires, so there
were no cases of asking the mentioned consent.
Only in one case, a radio concessionaire submitted a request for daily broadcasting in
the Czech language for Czech tourists during tourist season, according to the provision of
Article 64, Paragraph 3 of the Telecommunications Act, which was approved.

of the Ministry of culture for buying books, which was open till the end of 1998, there were
also suggestions for buying books printed by national communities or minorities, which are
given to libraries in the Republic of Croatia.
In the Republic of Croatia, there are ten central libraries of minorities, which are all

56

During 1998, a part of the programme of national minorities was financed from the
budget resources, within the regular registration of the programme for museum, gallery,
library and publishing activities, for example:
The association of Hungarian scientists and artists in Croatia (2 programmes in
museum and gallery activities), the Croatian Israeli association (1 programme in museum and
gallery activities), the National association of Montenegrins of Croatia (1 programme in
museum gallery activities), Jewish commune Zagreb (5 programmes, museum- gallery
activities). The work of Baranja art colony in Batina was also financed in 1998, where
representatives of national minorities also took part.
The Ministry of culture encourages direct participation of representatives of certain
regional and minority languages in planning cultural activities by part- financing national
reviews and folk art. Within the programme of these events (Ðakovo, Vinkovci, Petrijevci,
Nova Gradiška, Slavonski Brod, Zagreb, Porec and others) minority groups and their
cultural-artistic associations always take part, including folklore, instrumental or singing
ensembles.
During 1997 and 1998 in the cultural sphere the Libraries Act, the Archives Act, the
Theatres (Modifications and Supplements) Act and the Museums Act were adopted. These
laws regulate questions of establishing and organisation of cultural institutions (public and
private) and the way of performing their activities. According to their provisions, members of
national minorities can establish institutions for cultural activities they are interested in, in
order to achieve their cultural autonomy and to express their national and cultural identity.
By virtue of laws governing cultural issues, members of national minorities enjoy full
equality with other citizens of the Republic of Croatia and there are no special provision
which would specifically be related to them.
Subparagraph (g) is applied by ensuring publishing activities in languages of
minorities – by means of existence of big publishing houses of particular national minorities
like e.g., “Edit” Rijeka, “Jednota” Daruvar, “Prosvjeta” Zagreb, “Magyar Kepes Ujsag”
Osijek etc. which are financially supported by the Republic of Croatia and competent
counties, towns and municipalities.
Article 13 – Economic and Social Life
a) Chosen provisions:
Paragraph 1, Subparagraph (a),
Subparagraph (b),
Subparagraph (c),
b) Measures undertaken for the implementation of the chosen provisions

INTRODUCTORY COMMENTARY:
Laws from the sphere of economy primarily regulate relations from industry,
shipbuilding, commerce, power supply, mining industry, craftsmanship, co-operative
57

movement and are based on economic rights of property, entrepreneurship and market
freedom guaranteed by the Constitution, the guarantee of equal legal position on the market,
the prohibition of the monopoly and encouraging of economic progress and development of
all the areas.
Matters regulated by provisions from the economic sphere, as well as measures taken
and carried out in that area have no direct connection with the question of protection and
promotion of languages of minorities which are regulated by the European Charter for
Regional and Minority Languages.
Issues regulated by the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, as
well as obligations contained in it, primarily refer to the right to use a regional or minority
language in private and public life of national minorities, i.e. to human rights, whose
protection can be identified in the application of regulations and measures dealing with
employment contracts, as well as with technical documents like instructions for the use of a
device, i.e. safety instructions.The said issues require adoption of a special law on the official
use of languages of minorities.
The right for the use of regional and minority languages within economy is exercised
by the realisation of social and cultural rights.
Paragraph 1, Subparagraphs (a) and (c):
In laws and by- laws from the economic spheres there is not a single provision which
prohibits or limits without a justifiable reason the use of the language of the minority, in
documents which refer to the economic life. As the documents here mentioned (employment
contracts, technical documents, instructions for the use of devices) are regulated by laws and
regulations on work and social welfare, for which, as already mentioned, a special law on the
official use of languages of minorities has to be adopted and its adoption is expected.
Regarding economic activity, only provisions which regulate conditions of
performing economic activities are mentioned here.
In two basic laws which regulate performing economic activities (Companies Act and
Craftsmanship Act) there is not a single provision which opposes obligations from
Subparagraph (a) and (c) of this Paragraph, i.e. which would condition performing of
economic activities by prohibition or limitation of the use of the language of the minority.

Craftsmanship Act
Article 3.
“An individual person can practice a craft if he fulfils the following
conditions:
1. if he is a citizen of the Republic of Croatia
2. if he is of age and is not partially of completely lacking legal capacity,
3. if he meets general health conditions and special health conditions if determined
by the law

58

4. if safety measures or a protective measure on the prohibition of practising craft
during this measure is not pronounced by a final sentence or decision on
violation.”
Companies Act
Article 1, Paragraph 1
“If not determined differently by this law, a merchant is a legal or individual
person who independently permanently performs the economic activity for the
realisation of profit by production, trade turnover or offering services at the market.”
Co-operatives Act
Article 1, Paragraph 2
“(2) According to this Act, a co-operative member is an individual person who
completely or partially sells his products or uses services necessary for performing
his activities or in any other way directly participates in the achievement of his aims
for which the co-operative society was established.”
The Companies Act in provisions on the name of a company in Article 20, Paragraph
3 regulates that a name can be registered in a register of companies also by translating it into
one or several foreign languages.
The mentioned provision includes languages of minorities.
Provisions on the name of the Companies Act are adequately applied to the name of a
craft company, as well as to the name of a co-operative.
Paragraph 2, Subparagraph (b):
The same as Paragraph 1, Subparagraphs (a) and (c)
Subparagraph (e)
When adopting certain regulations - as for example the Protection of Consumers Act
which is planned for adoption - measures will be taken for providing information about the
rights of consumers, for which the competent public authority in languages of minorities
takes care about.
Paragraph 2, Subparagraph (b):
In cases of performance of economic activities in a form of a craft, the competent
state administration body, in accordance to the Craftsmanship Act, gives professional opinion
regarding adequate qualifications (professions) as a special condition for performing
activities. In cases when a member of national minority wants an opinion and provides a
certificate as a proof of his qualification in a language of minority, this certificate is accepted
as a valid document.

59

Regarding the scope of work and social care, it is indicated that special laws which
regulate this sphere do not include provisions on the use of languages of minorities, but these
questions will also be regulated by the future law on the official use of a language and script
which are used by members of minorities in the Republic of Croatia.

Article 14 – Transfrontier Exchanges
b) Measures undertaken for the implementation of the chosen provisions

Constitutional law on human rights and freedom and on the rights of
ethnic and national communities and minorities in the Republic of
Croatia
Article 4.
The Republic of Croatia shall assist the development of the relations between
national and ethnic communities and minorities with the nationality in their parent
country in order to promote their national, cultural and linguistic development.
Ethnic and national communities or minorities shall have the right to selforganisation and associatiation in order to realize their national and other rights in
compliance with the Constitution and this Law.
Article 59
The Republic of Croatia shall co-operate with and seek counsel, directly or
through mixed committees, from governments and other institutions of interested
states for the full realisation of human rights and rights of national and ethnic
communities or minorities.
The Republic of Croatia promotes and supports co-operation of members of
minorities with their ethnic motherlands. Special measures of promotion of such co-operation
refer to exemption from duties and tax for literature and equipment donated by ethnic
motherlands to members of their minority, which is regulated by bilateral agreements with
individual countries. Programmes of cultural and other exchanges are also stimulated and
ethnic motherlands are enabled to support members of their minority.
