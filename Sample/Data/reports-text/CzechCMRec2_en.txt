of the Committee of Ministers
on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
by the Czech Republic
(Adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 30 January 2013
at the 1160th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies)

The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages;
Having regard to the instrument of ratification submitted by the Czech Republic on 15 November 2006;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts on the Charter with respect to the
application of the Charter by the Czech Republic;
Bearing in mind that this evaluation is based on information submitted by the Czech Republic in its second
periodical report, supplementary information given by the Czech authorities, information submitted by bodies and
associations legally established in the Czech Republic and information obtained by the Committee of Experts
during its on-the-spot visit;
Having taken note of the comments made by the Czech authorities on the contents of the Committee of Experts'
report;
Recommends that the authorities of the Czech Republic take account of all the observations and
recommendations of the Committee of Experts and, as a matter of priority:
1.
continue the efforts to promote awareness and tolerance vis-à-vis all the regional or minority languages
and the cultures they represent as an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Czech Republic, both in the
general curriculum at all stages of education and in the media;
2.
further improve legislation concerning the committees for national minorities, so that these do not
present barriers to the implementation of the Charter, including the provision of education in regional or minority
languages and the setting-up of bilingual topographical signs;
3.
adopt a structured policy for the protection and promotion of German and Romani, and create favourable
conditions for their use in public life;
4.
take measures to make available teaching in or of German and Romani, in co-operation with the
speakers;
5.

continue the efforts to ensure that speaking Romani at school is not prohibited or discouraged.
