EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES

Second periodical report
presented to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe
in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter

CZECH REPUBLIC

SECOND PERIODICAL REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNDERTAKINGS
ARISING FROM THE EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY

LANGUAGES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC

Introduction
The Czech Republic ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (hereinafter
referred to as “the Charter”) on 15 November 2006. Upon ratification, a declaration was made
committing the CR to apply selected provisions of Part III in accordance with Article 2 paragraph 2
and Article 3 paragraph 1 of the Charter. The Charter came into force in the Czech Republic on 1
March 2007, in accordance with Article 19 paragraph 2. On the same day it was also published in
the Collection of International Treaties of the CR under no. 15/2007.
Article 15 of the Charter stipulates that the Parties shall present periodically to the Secretary General of
the Council of Europe a report on the application of the commitments they have accepted. On 30 April,
the Czech Republic submitted the Initial Periodic Report1 to Strasbourg, after its approval by the
Government on 25 February 2008 in Resolution no. 172.2 In December 2008, the Committee of
Experts for the Charter, together with the Secretariat of the Government Council for National Minorities
(hereinafter referred to as the “Council”) subsequently undertook a monitoring visit to the Czech
Republic, as part of the monitoring process for the Charter, during which it attended hearings of
representatives of national minorities, local authorities and the relevant government authorities. On the
basis of the Initial Period Report and of information obtained during the monitoring visit, the Committee
of Experts for the Charter prepared its own evaluation report for the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe and published it on 9 December 2009.3 The report includes an assessment of how
the Czech Republic is meeting its obligations under the Charter.
In accordance with Article 16 of the Charter, the Secretariat of the Council presented the
Government with draft Comments from the Czech Republic on the evaluation report from the
Committee of Experts.4 These Comments were drafted by the Secretariat of the Council and
reviewed by its members, i.e. representatives of public authorities and representatives of the
national minorities. After approval by the Government, which adopted Resolution no. 1060 on 26
August 2009,5 it was submitted to the Council of Europe by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
Committee of Ministers subsequently sent the Government of the CR five pages of recommendations
concerning its obligations under the Charter.6 These included a requirement to promote awareness and
tolerance towards the relevant regional or minority languages and cultures, both in the general
curriculum at all levels of education and also in the media, with special attention being paid to the
protection and development of Romani and German and the creation of favourable conditions to support

their use in public life. The Committee also devoted special care to committees for national minorities
in municipalities and their powers in areas of education and bilingual names and signs. The
Government should promote access to education in Slovak, Romani and German and ensure that the use
of Romani in schools is not prohibited and that barriers are not erected against its use.
In accordance with Article 15 of the Charter, the Czech Republic (hereinafter referred to as “CR”)
is presenting the Second Periodical Report on the Implementation of the Undertakings arising from
the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in the Czech Republic within the
prescribed three-yearly interval. This report has been prepared on the basis of documents provided
by the relevant ministries responsible for exercising national minority policy, government bodies,
comments from members of the Government Council for National Minorities (hereinafter referred
to as the “Council”), i.e. representatives of public authorities and representatives of national
minorities and monitoring reports from the Council Secretariat. The report was debated by the
Government Council for National Minorities on 22 March 2011.

Part I
1.

Current information on the numbers and geographic distribution of people speaking regional or minority languages.

Mother tongue statistics are regarded as the most accurate source of information on the number of
speakers of regional and minority languages. This data was recorded by a question included in the 2001
census. Between 25 and 26 March 2011 a new census will be held and, after being assessed, will
provide up-to-date information on the number and geographic distribution of people speaking regional
or minority languages. Question no. 10 in the census form requests the mother tongue of the
respondent: apart from Czech, the languages offered are Slovak, Romani, Polish, German (and sign
language), and a blank field is provided to enter another language. The option of entering two
languages is provided for.
The Secretariat of the Government Council for Romani Community Affairs works together with the
Czech Statistical Office on information strategies to support socially excluded Roma in the 2011
Census of people and households, which are designed to eliminate any distrust by the Roma and
their fear that any information they provide on their nationality will be misused, to raise awareness
by the Roma of the way the census is carried out and the manner data is protected during its
collection and processing; to raise awareness of the links between the results of the census and the
exercise of the rights of members of national minorities in accordance with Act No. 273/2001 Coll.,
on rights of members of national minorities.
2.

Provide information on any changes in policies, legislation and practices with regard to regional or minority languages
during the period under review.

On the basis of Government Regulation No. 98/2002 Coll., laying down the conditions and method of
providing grants from the state budget for the activities of members of national minorities and to
facilitate the integration of the Romani community, as amended, the Ministry of Culture administers
three grant programmes that affect minority languages to varying levels and which receive annual
funding from the state budget. The share of the grant typically covers 70% of the total project budget.
In exceptional cases, this share is increased up to 100%.
○ Programme to promote the dissemination and reception of information in national minority
languages
Under this programme, aid is provided for the publication of periodicals in national minority
languages or the production of programmes for radio and television broadcasts in national minority
languages, on the basis of projects submitted. In 2008 and 2009, 30 million CZK were allocated to
these projects every year from the state budget, in 2010, due to the financial crisis, this support was
reduced to 23,847 thousand CZK.
○ Programme to support cultural activities of members of national minorities
The programme is thematically directed towards artistic activities, cultural and educational
activities, the study and analysis of national cultures and folk traditions, multi-ethnic cultural events
(also aimed at combating any negative manifestations of extremism, racial and national intolerance
and xenophobia), editorial activities (non-periodic publications) and the documentation of national
culture. In 2008 and 2009, the Ministry of Culture allocated almost 10 million CZK to this
programme, in 2010, due to the financial crisis, the amount of funding was limited and 8.5 million
CZK was distributed.
○ Programme to promote the integration of the Romani community
6

Under this programme, the Ministry of Culture supports artistic activities each year (theatres,
museums, galleries, libraries, concerts, shows, festivals), cultural and educational activities (e.g.
seminars, lectures, discussions), scientific research on Romani culture, traditions and history, the
documentation of Romani culture, the study and analysis of Romani culture and traditions, editorial
activities (non-periodic publications), multi-ethnic cultural events (also aimed at combating any
negative manifestations of extremism, racial and national intolerance and xenophobia). A total of
between 1.5 and 2 million CZK are earmarked for this programme each year.
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports also implements grant programmes relating to
minority or regional languages:
○ Promoting education in minority languages and multicultural education
In addition to education in the languages of the national minorities, this programme also supports
projects for the creation of educational programmes and teaching materials in the area of national
minority education, aimed at exploring the history and culture of other nations, at teaching democratic
citizenship, mutual tolerance and combating racial and national intolerance, xenophobia and antiSemitism, as well as research focusing on the area of educating children and young people from national
and ethnic minorities living in the CR. Over the past three years, the Ministry of Education, Youth and
Sports has devoted an average of 17.5 million CZK a year to these activities.
○ Promoting the education of socially disadvantaged children, pupils and students (to promote the
integration of the Romani community)
Under this grant programme, over 100 projects are supported every year. The total amount earmarked
for grants each year is 15 million CZK. The project also covers support for educational success in
socially disadvantaged children and young people, the activities of low-threshold facilities for children
and young people, etc.
○ Promoting the integration of members of the Romani community (support for Roma secondary
school pupils)
A programme to support Roma secondary school pupils has been adjusted since September 2009 for
socially disadvantaged Roma secondary school pupils and students attending higher vocational
schools. The programme aims to fund the educational of these Roma pupils whose families would
experience considerable financial difficulties if faced with the costs associated with secondary
school studies. The sum of 10 million CZK was spent on this grant programme in 2010. Based on
experience from previous years, the programme was amended from September 2010 in order to
motivate pupils (and their families) not only to begin their studies but also to complete them
successfully. Because of this the grant was graded according to the year the pupil is attending. The
programme applies to all schools entered in the register of schools that provide secondary
education, secondary education with a certificate of apprenticeship, secondary education with a
graduation certificate, higher vocational education and higher vocational conservatoire education.
It applies to schools established by regions or municipalities, private and church schools. The
programme only covers pupils who regularly attend school, or who have documented reasons for
their absences, and who have no major disciplinary problems. The programme has two rounds (the
period from January – June and from September – December) and pupils may receive a maximum
of 4,000 to 10,000 CZK for each round (the highest sum concerns the fourth year). In 2010 around
1,000 pupils and students received grants for both periods.
On the basis of its ratification of the Charter, the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic
has funding to support its implementation. This concerns:

○ The Support for the Implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
Grant Programme
During 2008 and 2009 funds were allocated from the state budget and the Office of the Government
of the Czech Republic transferred a non-investment grant from its chapter to the account of the
Moravian-Silesian region to ensure the implementation of the Charter. These were initially
provided to cover the costs of interpretation and the translation to Czech of written applications
submitted in Polish, and also to cover costs relating to meeting obligations to use local names
(names of municipalities and streets) and names of public buildings in the Polish language.
In 2010 the funding underwent major changes, because this specific grant was transformed into a
Grant Programme to support the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages7 in order to make more effective use of the funds. This made it possible to extend the
support for Polish to the other languages listed in Part III of the Charter (German, Romani and
Slovak).

The programme has existed since January 2010 and focuses on the following topical areas of
activities in relation to Polish, the Těšin dialect, as well as its regional variations, Slovak, German
and Romani:
-

-

Educational activities at all levels of education extending beyond the standard curriculum,
focusing on teaching a minority language or taking place in that language. The target group for
these activities are both people with a minority language as their mother tongue and people with
the Czech language as their mother tongue. It was assumed that the activities were focused on
training teachers with the aim of supporting minority languages in an environment where people
have Czech as a mother tongue. Ten projects were evaluated.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses focusing on research into the use of minority languages,
indicating their areas of support and proposing the form of this support. Five projects were selected in
this area.
Support for the use of traditional and correct forms of local names in minority languages (the
creation and installation of signs bearing the names of municipalities, their parts, streets and
other public spaces and the designation of the buildings of state authorities and local
governments). Grants were awarded to two projects.

A table listing the projects receiving assistance for the implementation of activities to benefit
regional or minority languages can be found in the annex to this report.

Indicate any developments you expect over the next monitoring cycle, such as anticipated political or budgetary
changes, political plans or other elements that may have a direct or indirect impact on the situation concerning
regional or minority languages.

In March 2011 the Council submitted to the government a proposal to change the status of this
advisory body to reflect the ratification of the Charter as one of the fundamental documents
7

On the basis of Government Resolution No. 315 of 27 April 2010, amending Government Resolution No. 1574 of 7
December 2005, on a proposal to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ETS 148)

defining the Council’s activities, to emphasise the protection of “minority languages” (terminology
compatible with the Charter) in the Council’s activities, to change the conditions of membership in
such a way as to give less weight to the approximate (and often misleading) number of people
declaring themselves of different nationalities in the last census and to give more weight to the
importance of minority languages under the protection of the Charter, to cooperation with linguistic
professionals and with local government representatives, where the issue of language protection is
always very current8.
On 21 December 2009 the government approved Resolution No. 1572 the Strategy for Roma
Integration for the period from 2010–2013. This is a strategic document in which the CR also
agrees to support research and teaching of the Romani language; to create methodological and
teaching materials and aids for teaching Romani; to support literature written in Romani.
The Council initiated a draft amendment to Act No. 128/2000 Coll. on municipalities (the municipal
system) as amended, Act No. 129/2000 Coll. on regions (regional system) as amended, and Act No.
131/2000 Coll. on the capital city of Prague in March 2009 to facilitate the enforcement of the
rights of national minorities with regard to committees for national minorities and bilingual signs.
The proposal was part of the Report on the situation of national minorities in the CR in 2008 and a
related resolution obliged the Minister of the Interior to implement the proposal at the earliest
amendment to the laws referred to above (see response to point 4.C).
In accordance with the introduction of a new model of school-leaving examinations9, it has been
guaranteed under the Education Act10 that, from the 2010/2011 academic year, pupils in schools and
classes teaching in the language of national minorities will have the right to take both the common
and the profile part of the school leaving examination in Czech or in the language of their national
minority, with the exception of Czech language and literature examinations.

Please provide a detailed explanation of any legislative or practical measures the state has adopted to implement each
of the recommendations from the Council of Ministers.

A) Practical steps taken to enhance awareness and tolerance of regional or minority languages
and the cultures they represent as an integral part of the heritage of the Czech Republic, both
in the general curriculum at all stages of education and in the mass media.
The Czech Republic supports the dissemination of information (periodicals, television and radio
broadcasting) in the national minority languages, in other words those that are protected by the
Charter, in the form of subsidies.
A reform of the educational system is underway in the Czech Republic, part of which involves the
creation of school educational programmes following the Framework Educational Programmes
issued by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport. The issue of multicultural education,
learning to respect human rights and education against extremism, racism and intolerance is an
integral part of the Framework Educational Programmes (hereinafter referred to as FEP) for basic
and secondary schools and as such has been implemented in individual school educational
programmes (hereinafter referred to as SEP) under the curricular reforms. In particular, the
Framework Educational Programmes set specific goals, the form, length and content of compulsory
education and are binding on the content of the SEP.

In 2010 the legislative phase for the introduction of the fundamental changes in educational
programmes set out in the Education Act was completed, gradually reducing the original number of
subjects to newly conceived, more complex fields of education.
In June 2010 a new Government Decree No. 211/2010 Coll., on the curriculum for basic, secondary
and higher vocational education was published in the Collection of Laws. The FEP for one- and
two-year Practical School was completed and approved in 2010 (RVP PRŠ 1, RVP PRŠ 2). In
August 2010 is was sent in electronic form (DVD) to the Practical Schools which, in accordance
with the Framework Educational Programmes, will create their school educational programmes,
which will begin to regulate the teaching curriculum in 2012. There is no cross-sectional topic of
Multicultural Education in the Framework Educational Programmes for these schools, although
subjects relating to multicultural education are covered in the RVP PRŠ 1 in the cross-sectional
topic Personal and social development as part of the Social development subject and in the RVP
PRŠ 2 in the cross-sectional topic Personal and social education under the Human relations and
ethnic origin subject.
All Framework Educational Programmes for grammar and secondary vocational schools contain the
cross-sectional topic The citizen in a democratic society, which incorporates the issue of combating
extremism and xenophobia. The cross-sectional topic focuses the training and educational process
on ensuring that pupils are, for example, capable of moral judgement, of resisting ideological
manipulation, of critically assessing media content and of discussing sensitive issues with others
and finding compromises.
The history and culture of minorities living on the territory of the CR will be incorporated in the
Framework Educational Programmes in extended form during the “cyclical” revisions of the FEP.
In the history curriculum, emphasis is placed on recent history, especially that of the 20th century
and includes teaching on fascism, Nazism, the Second World War, Nazi racial and other
persecution, the resistance to Nazism, the Holocaust and the genocide of the Roma. The
curriculum, which provides instruction in democratic citizenship, contains the following keywords:
political radicalism and extremism, the current Czech extremist scene and its symbolism, youth and
extremism.
Schools are also advised to include in their school educational programmes (SEP) a sufficient
content of another mandatory cross-sectional topic Multicultural education. The recommendations
published in previous years in the Collection of Pedagogic and Organisational Information for
kindergartens, PS, SS, conservatoires, higher vocational schools, basic art schools, language schools
providing state language examinations and school facilities still apply. There are, for example,
links to comprehensive information about the Holocaust of the Roma and Jews, which can be
obtained from professional seminars on How to teach about the Holocaust or as part of the
documentary project for pupils entitled Lost neighbours (organised by the Education Department of
the Terezín Memorial and the Educational and Cultural Centre of the Jewish Museum in Prague).
At the same time attention is drawn to publications by the so-called Holocaust deniers. Schools are
also encourages to emphasise the topic of Czech-German relations in their teaching programme,
including objective information on the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans, allowing pupils to
understand the culture, language and everyday life of other nationalities and ethnicities living in the
CR and to provide information on current extremist social phenomena (anti-Semitism,
Islamophobia, neo-Nazism, right- and left-wing extremism).

Methodological support

The Research Institute of Education (Výzkumný ústav pedagogický) (RIE), an organisation run
directly by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, drafted an Analysis of Framework
Educational Programmes for primary education in the prevention of risky behaviour. This covered
all areas – objectives for primary education, key competences, learning areas (educational fields),
10

cross-sectional topics. The analysis mainly focused on the content and terminological aspects of
individual forms of risky behaviour, including racist, xenophobic and extremist attitudes.
In 2010, the issue of multicultural education was dealt with as part of a long-term, systematic
ministerial task focusing on methodological support for the teaching of cross-sectional themes
(which also included Multicultural education). Within the framework of this task, recommended
expected outcomes (REO) were developed for each of the subject areas for the cross-sectional topic
of Multicultural education as a concretisation of the cross-sectional topics in the FEP, both for the
first and second primary school levels and for grammar schools.
As follows from the nature of the cross-sectional topics, recommended expected outcomes focus on
developing attitudes and values and, in the case of Multicultural education, they have been taken
from an innovative concept, which was elaborated as part of the Development Strategy for
Multicultural Education in 2009.
They take account of cross-cultural approaches, which helps to minimise the risk of excluding
individuals on the basis of their group identity and to prevent extremist attitudes. It can also be
considered an important fact that, at the level of the REO, there is an effective overlap between
individual cross-sectional topics, particularly between Multicultural education, Democratic
Citizenship education and Training to think in a European and global context.
The REO were tested at selected primary schools and grammar schools and examples of specific
teaching situations were created for teachers in which the individual recommended expected outputs
could be achieved. Methodological materials are gradually being added and published on the
Methodological website www.rvp.cz.
Concerning this task, a full questionnaire survey was carried out in 2010, which mainly addressed
teachers’ attitudes to the issue of cross-sectional topics (including Multicultural education) and
questions relating to their teaching. The results of the questionnaire survey will be published on the
Research Institute of Education website and on www.rvp.cz. In response to teachers’ needs a
DigiFolio, collecting together basic texts and information on issues relating to inclusive education,
was uploaded to www.rvp.cz.11
Part of the ongoing activities of the RIE involves work on comparative studies of inclusive
approaches in selected countries. A comparative study on Concepts for cross-sectional topics was
drafted and materials relating to educational system and curricular documentation were collected.
These continue to be used as a source of information for the analysis of inclusive approaches.
An important source of information, methodology and communication in the area of multicultural
education is the methodological portal www.rvp.cz already mentioned above. The methodological
portal www.rvp.cz is managed by the Research Institute of Education in Prague, in collaboration
with the National Institute for Vocational Training, an organisation directly managed by the
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports. The project is co-financed from the European Social
Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic and its primary goal is to develop systemic support
for teachers during the implementation of educational reforms. The texts published in the
Methodological portal relate to issues such as racism, xenophobia, multicultural societies, etc.
In addition to the portal referred to above, other web portals established by the Ministry of
Education, in which media activities in the field of multicultural education, the prevention of racist,
xenophobic and extremist attitudes, education for tolerance and respect for human rights are
supported on an on-going basis, are another source of information for multicultural education.12

At the beginning of the 2009/2010 academic year, a new nation-wide project, co-financed by the
ESF and the state budget of the CR and aimed at working with schools, was launched in 9 towns in
the Czech Republic (Brno, České Budějovice, Hradec Králové, Karviná, Most, Olomouc, Opava,
Plzeň and Prague). The Institute of Pedagogical Psychological Counselling of the CR contributed
to project implementation. The Centre for the support of inclusive education project (hereinafter
referred to as the CSIE)13 continues the work of the Centre for the Integration of
Minorities (hereinafter referred to as the CIM), but compared to the work of the CIM there has been
a shift and a change in the target groups. The Centre for the Integration of Minorities primarily
worked with children (mainly from socio-culturally disadvantaged backgrounds), whom it tried to
assist in managing problems associated with school attendance. During its operation, the CIM
tested a number of tools suitable for working directly with children, given that most of the services
provided by its staff involved working with classes of children; diagnostics of children’s special
educational needs; tutoring; social work with children’s families; organising educational and
recreational activities, etc.
The CSIE has shifted the focus of its activities more towards pedagogical staff. The Centre’s staff
expects that assistance directed towards schools and pedagogical staff, helping them to manage
increasing demands on the education of children with various difficulties, may ultimately be more
important than assistance directed to specific individual pupils. The Centre is striving to ensure that
schools are able to offer inclusive education and to develop each child’s potential according to
his/her individual, and in the case of certain pupils special, educational needs. This plan is also
reflected in the basic CSIE mission to support school facilities and schools, which should
themselves gradually learn to introduce suitable tools (methods, forms of teaching, etc.) to meet the
individual educational needs of each child. The project is based on the “simple” assumption that
basically every pupil capable of learning in “mainstream education” should have the opportunity to
do so – i.e. that schools (teachers) should be able to provide for them.
Each of the nine Centres, in collaboration with the regional and municipal authorities, selects ten to
fifteen schools each year, a selection that includes schools of different sizes and different levels of
need in terms of inclusive education. Amongst these are always one or two “pilot schools” which
have already managed to apply principles of inclusive education to a greater or lesser extent. An
important outcome of the work of the CSIE, relating to these pilot schools, also involves the
creation of a network of collaborating schools and other educational institutions to exchange
examples of “good practice” and other experiences. In relation to assistance for schools and their
founders, the CSIE is also involved in raising funding for schools by getting subsidies or grants
(project management) or directly providing schools with psychological and special-pedagogical
counselling. At the same time it provides preparation and support for the types of courses that will
be beneficial in guiding schools towards the concept of inclusive education as part of the continuous
training of pedagogical staff.
B) Implementation of policies to protect Romani and German and to promote their use in public
life.
○ Romani
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport commissioned the translation of the fundamental
documents of the Council of Europe relating to the teaching of the Romani language. These
documents were translated into Czech, into the Northern Central Romani and Lovari Romani and
were published on the Council of Europe website. They include the following:

Curriculum framework for instruction in the Romani language (devised in collaboration with
the European Roma and Travellers Forum). The curriculum framework for leaching the
Romani language contains curricular elements and reference levels and its aim is to help
children from different socio-cultural backgrounds: those who do not speak Romani at home,
children to need to improve their level of Romani and children who, although they speak
Romani, need to attain a level where they can use the language as a tool for further learning.
European Language Portfolio Learning the Romani language for instruction in Romani for
lower secondary students (for pupils from 11 to 16 years).
European Language Portfolio Learning the Romani language for instruction in Romani for
primary school students (for pupils from 6 to 11 let).
Handbook for teachers Using the European Language Portfolio for Romani.
Following on from these instruments, a two-year project (2010-2011) was launched in the European
Centre (Council of Europe) for modern languages in Graz entitled Education of Roma children in
Europe, which aims to incorporate these tools into the education systems of the Member States and
to test pilot versions. The main partner for the European Centre (Council of Europe) for modern
languages in Graz is the University of Graz, but the project also has a number of other partners,
including Charles University Philosophical Faculty, Romani studies seminars, Institute of South and
Central Asia. Between 24 and 26 February 2010 an international seminar on the project was held in
Prague, with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport providing both organisational and
financial assistance. The seminar was designed primarily for those training teachers of the Romani
language and also included a discussion of the final form of a related draft project, which was
submitted to and then approved by the European Commission under the EU Lifelong Learning
Programme.
○ German
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport supports the language activities of grammar schools
that provide instruction in German leading to the award of the German language diploma. This
diploma entitles students to study at German universities without taking further language
examinations. The Ministry of Culture supports the publication of periodicals in German. The state
administration and local government contribute to the activities of the German national minority in
the form of grants and ad hoc assistance and also promote the German language. A detailed
overview of this support is provided in Part III and in the Annex to this report.
C) Improving the laws relating to the composition and powers of committees for national
minorities to ensure that these rules do not constitute obstacles to the implementation of the
Charter, including the establishment of schools providing instruction in regional or minority
languages and the use of Polish place names in topographical signs.
Improving the legislation relating to the use of Polish place names in topographical signs
The placement of additional road signs indicating the entrance and exit to the municipality in the
language of the national minority is regulated by Decree No. 30/2001 Coll., on road traffic rules. In
accordance with Section 13 paragraph 1 (v) and (w) of this regulation, and under the conditions laid
down by special legislation14, the municipality places the name of the municipality in the language
of the national minority (a sign indicating the entrance and exit to the municipality) under the road
sign to show the name of the municipality in the language of the national minority. A total of 31
municipalities in the Karviná and Frýdek-Místek districts comply with the legislative requirements
14

Section 29 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on Municipalities (the Municipal Order), as amended.

13

for the installation of bilingual Czech-Polish signs. Until such time as the amended decree was
adopted,15 the installation of these bilingual signs had been partially suspended.
After the ratification of the Charter, since 2007, there has been a gradual installation of these signs
in the municipalities (and has been completed in two-thirds of the municipalities referred to above),
the degree of bilingualism has been determined by each municipality individually on the basis of a
recommendation by its Committee for National Minorities. There is a wide range, from bilingual
signs on official buildings, through bilingual signs on other publicly accessible spaces, to road signs
indicating the entrance and exit of the municipality. However, in some municipalities, the
installation of the last-mentioned type is complicated by misunderstandings between the
representatives of the national minorities and the relevant authorities.
On 29 June 2009, the government approved Resolution No. 845 (on the basis of the Resolution of the
Government Council for National Minorities), which obliges the Ministry of the Interior to amend
laws on territorial self-governing units, specifically an adjustment to the provisions of Section 29
paragraph 2 and Section 117 paragraph 3 of Act No. 128/2000 Coll., on municipalities (the Municipal
Order), as amended, Section 78 paragraph 2 of Act No. 129/2000 Coll., on regions (the Regional
Order), as amended, and Section 78 paragraph 2 of Act No. 131/2000 Coll., on the Capital City of
Prague, as amended, prepared in accordance with Annex No. 14 of the Report on the situation of
national minorities in the Czech Republic for 2008. The proposed change, which is based on practical
experience of establishing committees and with the marking of public spaces, was prepared by the
Committee for cooperation with local authorities for the Government Council for National Minorities,
which approved it at its meeting on 17 February 2009 (before being submitted to the government, the
final version was also approved by the Council on 6 May 2009). The Ministry of the Interior, in
collaboration with the Council Secretariat, prepared a legislative draft of the relevant legal
amendment, which will be incorporated as instructed by the government in the next revision of the
legislation concerning territorial self-governing units, to be completed by the end of 2011.
Making these changes will require the practical experience of the Government Council for National
Minorities,16 when the Committees for national minorities in the individual municipalities are not
always prepared to meet the requests of national minority representatives to install bilingual signs,
even though this attitude has no legitimate backing. The amendment is designed to respond to this
situation and should introduce the option of applying directly to a civic association, which
represents the interests of the relevant national minority and which has been present on the territory
of the municipality for at least 5 years on the date the application is submitted. In both cases, the
basic requirement that at least 10% of the residents of the municipality registered as members of the
given nationality at the latest census applies.
Similarly as before, an application by the civic association, as in the case of a recommendation
made by the Committee for national minorities, should ensure that, after complying with other
conditions arising from Section 29 paragraph 2 of the Act on municipalities, the municipality is
required to install signs in the language of the national minority. The conditions would be set up in
such a way that a request by the representatives of the national minority, submitted through the
Committee for national minorities, would continue to be the main method of requesting multilingual signs, and the submission of a “qualified” application by the civic association would only be
an exceptional solution in cases when the committee fails properly to fulfil its role to represent the
interests of the national minority.

Improving the legislation relating to the composition and powers of committees for national
minorities
In connection with the above information concerning the upcoming amendment of Act No.
128/2000 Coll., on municipalities, it is planned that measures relating to the composition and
powers of committees for national minorities will be adopted, thereby amending Section 117,
paragraph 3, of the Act.
The proposed changes should reflect practical experience with establishing committees for national
minorities and also amend the mechanism for their establishment. The new regulation should make
the mandatory establishment of a committee dependent not only on the fact that over 10% of the
citizens of a municipality declared themselves to be of a nationality other than Czech at the latest
census, but also on the fact that a civic association representing the interests of a national minority
can make a written request for the establishment of a committee. The proposed amendment is
intended to accommodate the actual situation, because a census is generally only carried out at tenyear intervals and the presence of a national minority in the municipality may change in the
meantime, still leaving the municipality obliged to establish a committee. In practice, situations
have been known to occur where, after the last census, the national minority disappeared
completely, but the municipality still had to establish a committee for national minorities. The
proposed amendment to the law should prevent this type of situation taking place by requiring that
the mandatory establishment of a committee should depend again on an application, in other words
interest must be expressed on the part of the national minority itself. A written request may be
submitted by a civic association which, according to its statutes, represents the interests of certain of
the national minorities which are present in the given municipality.
The effects of the application would only apply during the term of office of the local authority
because after its expiration the committees established by the authority also terminate their
activities.
The proposed amendment would retain the condition that the members of the committee must be
members of the national minority, but would eliminate the requirement that these representatives
should be delegated by an association set up under special legislation,17 because this condition is
rather problematic in that it restricts the ability of the municipal authority freely to decide on the
composition of committees (in this case the municipal authority is limited to choosing only from the
representatives proposed by the association). Apart from this, these structures are also questionable
in terms of access to the committee for other members of national minorities, which are not
organised in an association. The amendment to the text of the Act would specifically add a solution
to a situation when all the conditions for the establishment of a committee had been met (the
existence of national minorities and a written request from a civic association), but where no one in
the municipality is interested in joining the committee. However, this amendment would not
prevent civic associations from exercising their entitlement to propose members of the committee to
the municipal authority, although they must exercise this entitlement in full accordance with the Act
on the right of petition. Members of national minorities may be selected by the local authority not
only from local government officials or residents of the municipality as any member of the national
minority may become a committee member.
D) Adoption of measures to mediate the provision of instruction in Slovak, Romani and German,
or training courses in these languages, in collaboration with native speakers.
○ Slovak

17

Act No. 83/1990 Coll., on association of citizens, as amended

15

Interest in establishing a secondary school providing instruction in Slovak in Prague was expressed
in the second half of 1994. At the end of September 1995, the Ministry of Education, Youth and
Sport received a request from representatives of the Club of Slovak Culture in the CR, the Slovak
Municipality in the CR and the Association of Slovaks in the CR to establish the Milan Rastislav
Štefánik grammar school in Prague. After much discussion, the promoters confirmed their interest
in establishing a school from 1 September 1996. The Slovak grammar school in Prague was
incorporated into the network of schools and a headmaster was appointed, but the school de facto
did not exist as only five pupils enrolled and for this reason it was removed from the network after a
certain number of years.
In the 1998/99 academic year, the Na Vítězné pláni grammar school in Prague was prepared to
begin providing instruction in Slovak. At least 12 candidates – pupils – were needed to set up the
department. Only 6 applied and it was agreed that Slovak would only be taught as an extracurricular activity.
The Na Vítězné pláni grammar school was also prepared in the
1999/2000 academic year to provide instruction of Slovak as an optional subject for children from
all over Prague. However there was no interest from Slovak nationals. It was noted that most
children and parents prioritised Czech when selecting a school, because they calculate with the fact
that the children will continue with their studies and at a higher level they might encounter
problems with their classifications in the Czech language.
Projects enabling the mediation of teaching in Slovak receive funding under a grant programme
from the Education Ministry to support education in languages of national minorities and
multicultural education and a grant programme to support the implementation of the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Additional information is provided in Part III of this
report.
○ Romani
In 2008, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport had already formulated the promotion of equal
opportunities in education as one of its priorities. An important area, which also relates to Roma
children and support for their education, involves the establishment of conditions for inclusive
education.
In 2010 the Ministry submitted to the government for its approval the National Action Plan for
Inclusive Education, which devotes increased attention to the education of Roma children from
socially marginalised communities and to the creation of inclusive mechanisms directed at children
with special educational needs, and which was approved on 15 March 2010 in Government
Resolution No. 206. Other partial measures were implemented in coordination with other
ministries, local authorities and the non-profit making sector.
The continuous development of the Early care concept targeted mainly at improving the conditions
for the pre-school preparation of children at risk of social exclusion from the age of three until they
start compulsory schooling. Under the Concept, increased attention is paid to pre-school
preparation for Roma children. The Concept mainly focuses on establishing conditions for quality
pre-preparation of children at risk of social exclusion by levelling out any disadvantages they may
have before they start mandatory schooling. The measures also focus on increasing the number of
Roma children and pupils in mainstream education and on supporting their academic success at all
levels of education. At each step, a great deal of attention is paid to working with the family of
these pupils to enable the parents to create support for their children’s education (social services,
pedagogical services, tutors).
In 2010 the CSIE project (Centre of support for inclusive education) was launched and professional
teams were assembled, operating in all regions of the CR. They provide methodological support
for pedagogical staff at all levels of the education system, focusing on specific pedagogical work for
16

children with special educational needs, strengthening of regional resources, creating a network of
experts, creating multidisciplinary teams providing support to pedagogical staff, pupils and the
families. Roma children are an important target group for the project.
Accredited degree programmes and programmes for lifelong learning offered by universities are
listed in Part III of this report. These include, for example, the preparation of teaching assistants
and Roma studies. Institutions accredited to train teachers for Romani include Charles University
in Prague, Faculty of Philosophy, for example.
Romani is taught in three secondary schools in the CR. The curriculum of the Secondary vocational
school of management and law, s. r. o., Kolín, contains information on Romani history, culture and
language, and prepares graduates to work in their own communities. This factor also stimulates the
interest of Roma children in studying, which was already confirmed in the retraining courses
offered by this school. Effective up to 2011, the following secondary education courses are offered:
Social work among ethnic minorities and Pedagogy for teaching assistants. These areas of
education are available until 2011, are only offered as long-distance forms of education and, by
their focus, are principally targeted at pupils from the Roma population. The Ministry uses these
programmes to promote the better education of the Romani minority, particularly adult Roma. The
curriculum includes compulsory subjects such as multicultural coexistence, selected methods of
social rights, social policy, social communication and the basics of Roma studies.
Under the grant programme Support for education in the languages of national minorities and
multicultural education in 2010, the sum of 100,000 CZK was provided for Courses in Romani, run
by the Museum of Romani Culture (this also received support in 2008 and 2009). The aim of the
courses is to make quality instruction in the Romani language by expert teachers available to
interested students (in ethnology, pedagogy, social pedagogy, special pedagogy, etc.), teachers and
teaching assistants, social workers, government workers and police officers, who encounter and
interact with members of the Romani minority through their daily work, as well as interested
members of the general public, and to allow them to learn about Romani culture and understand it
through learning the language. Knowledge of Romani facilitates the work of graduates of the
course with the Romani minority, enabling them to understand and communicate with its members.
Two courses will be run, one for beginners and the other low intermediate. The beginners’ course
will consist of two lessons once a week, while the intermediate course will comprise conversation
lessons with a native speaker. The courses are led by an expert on Roma issues with many years of
teaching practice and a Roma trainer. The course will also have video and audiovisual aids.
Besides language lessons, visitors can also study the museum’s collections and exhibitions and
other public events.
Under the same grant programme, a project by the Charles University Philosophical Faculty entitled
“Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the linguistic situation of the Roma in the CR” received a
total of 1,366,000 CZK in aid (the project follows on from a project from 2009: Research and
verification of work with Romani in schools, for which it paid 1,822,300 CZK and Sociolinguistic
research on the situation of the Roma in the CR, implemented by the same organisations and
supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport in 2008.).18 Previous projects have so far
provided unique and methodologically well-founded estimates of the competence of school-age
Roma children in Romani. In the qualitative part of the report from the survey, on the basis of a
limited sample of a few dozen respondents, the basic outline of the situation was summed up and
primarily indicated that Romani would be abandoned. The main objective of the project was to
broaden, deepen and add to knowledge of the language situation of the Roma and Romani in the
Czech Republic, which was brought by Socio-linguistic research into Romani.

18

Both surveys are published on www.romistika.eu

17

Expansion in 2010 consisted of quantitative research into the context in which language is
transferred, language attitudes, opinions on the possible support for language and its mutual
connections. Unlike the previous research, it was not only Romani that was investigated, but the
language repertoire of the Roma as a whole, meaning including Czech and any other languages.
Information acquired concerning the language situation in a given area is consulted with the
teachers at the relevant primary schools. Emphasis was also placed on expanding knowledge of
those speaking Walachian Romani. The deepening of existing areas of knowledge consisted of
long-term qualitative research into the language environment in selected Roma families. This part
also provided a different, more accurate, perspective on the quantitative data obtained.
The knowledge gained will be use in the education of Roma children and in directing aid to Romani
as a minority language (endangered by the language shift – in the case of Northern Central Romani
dialects) – one of the partial project objectives was to gather information on the preferences of the
Roma themselves on the issue of language support offered by the state. The results of the
quantitative research also allow us to make a rough estimate of the situation of Romani in a large
number of locations.
○ German
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport continuously supports language activities in grammar
schools offering instruction in German leading to the award of the German language diploma. This
diploma entitles students to study at German universities without having to take additional language
examinations. Extensive Czech-German activities also take place in the context of extracurricular
activities for young people.
In 2010 there was a significant change in the Grant programme to support the implementation of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which enabled projects involving not only
Polish and the Těšín dialect as its regional dialect, but also the Slovak, German and Romani
languages to be submitted to civic associations and schools. One of the measures was to support
educational activities at all levels of educational beyond basic education, which focus on teaching
minority languages or which take place in them. The target group for these activities includes both
people with a minority language as their mother tongue, and people with Czech as their mother
tongue. More detailed information is provided in Part III and in the Annex to this report.
E) The implementation of practical steps to stop the use of Romani being discouraged at schools.
In the Concept for Roma Integration for the period from 2010 – 2013, the government committed to ongoing support for research into the Romani language, the Roma Holocaust and Roma culture, to
creating the conditions for the institutional development of a degree subject of Roma studies and support
for extending this to other universities. It will also support the on-going expansion of Romani language
teaching at a regional level, creating materials to train pedagogic staff to work with pupils who speak
different languages, with regard to Roma pupils, the creation of methodological and didactic materials
for teaching Romani. It also undertook, in collaboration with the Research Institute of Education and
the National Institute of Vocational Education, to incorporate the topic of Roma culture and history in
the Framework Educational Programmes for schools, in accordance with the revision timetable for
Framework Educational Programmes for schools and, continuously, using the Czech School
Inspectorate to assess compliance of these programmes with the school educational programme, which
regulates the teaching of these topics in practice.

Please indicate any recent developments concerning the provisions of Article 7 of the Charter during the last
monitoring period (2008-2010).

Article 7, paragraph 1 – Objectives and principles
a) Recognition of the regional and minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth
In December 2009, in its Resolution No. 1572, the government approved the Concept for Roma
Integration for the period from 2010 – 2013, in which it undertakes to support research and teaching
of the Romani language and recognises it as part of Europe’s cultural wealth. The government
Campaign against racism took place in 2009 and 2010 with the announcement of the Gipsy Spirit
prize by the Section for Human Rights at the Office of the Government of the CR.
The aim of the Gypsy Spirit project is to create a tradition for the prestigious appraisement of work
towards the integration of the Roma and to show the general public examples of good practice in
the co-existence of the Romani community with the “majority”. In this sense the project
corresponds to one of the objectives of the Czech Presidency of the Decade of Roma Inclusion from
2005–2015, which took place from July 2010 to June 2011.
Gypsy Spirit prizes are awarded to companies, municipalities, non-profit making organisations or
individuals in the following categories:
-

NGOs – for the implementation of specific projects focusing on the support and development of
the Romani minority and results achieved
Company – a company supporting projects aimed at social assistance and support of the Romani
community
Extra-curricular educational activities aimed at Roma children and youth
Individual – whose work has contributed to improving the situation of Roma over the long term
Act of the year – which helped save lives or improve the quality of life for individuals.

In 2010 the Gypsy Spirit project took place under the auspices of the Prime Minister of the Czech
Republic, Petr Nečas, the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European
Parliament, Heidi Hautalaová, President Václav Havel and ex-minister for human rights Michael
Kocáb.
b) Respect for the geographical area of minority languages
Given that no change has occurred in this area during the period under review,19 please refer to the
information set out in the 2nd part of the Initial Periodic Report, presented to the Secretary General
of the Council of Europe in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter.
c) Action to help safeguard minority languages
In addition to the information set out in Part I of this report and in the 2nd part of the Initial Periodic
Report submitted to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in accordance with Article 15
of the Charter, we note that in 2010 there was a major change in the Grant programme to support
the implementation of a European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which enabled
projects involving not only Polish and the Těšín dialect as its regional dialect, but also the Slovak,
German and Romani languages to be submitted to civic associations and schools. One of the
measures was to support educational activities at all levels of educational beyond basic education,
which focus on teaching minority languages or which take place in them. The target group for these
activities includes both people with a minority language as their mother tongue, and people with
19

Council of Europe MIN-LANG instructions (2009) 8

19

Czech as their mother tongue. It was assumed that the activities also focused on teacher training
with the objective of supporting minority languages in an environment where the population has
Czech as a mother tongue. 10 projects were assessed under this measure.
d) Encouraging the use of minority languages
The Czech Republic systematically supports the use of minority languages through grant
programmes, paying special attention to measures to support the use of Romani. More detailed
information is provided in Part I of this report.
e) Developing links between groups using different languages
Links between those speaking different languages are mainly developed during cultural and social
actions organised by civic associations representing the individual national minorities, which
receive funding from the public administration of the CR.
On 21 June 2007 a National Minorities House was opened in Prague, housing civic associations for
the Bulgarian, Hungarian, German, Polish, Romani, Russian, Ruthenian, Greek, Slovak, Serbian
and Ukrainian minorities. The civic associations (not only those speaking the minority languages
listed) may use the common areas – exhibition hall, conference room, and a common room with
café – to present their particular culture, regardless of the regional affiliation of speakers of minority
languages.
Change in the deeds for the Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín
In 2010 an amendment to the deeds of the Pedagogical Centre was prepared (approved on 20
January 2011 under the title Measure of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport in accordance
with Section 169b paragraph 1 of Act No. 561/2004 Coll., on pre-school, primary, secondary,
higher vocational and other education (the Education Act), as amended, which issues Amendment
no. 2 to the deeds for the Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín).
In addition to technical aspects, this amendment updated the pedagogical terminology used in the
deeds and also enabled certain activities that contribute to meeting the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages20, and which the Pedagogical Centre had previously performed
without explicit reference to the foundation deeds, to be embodied directly in the deeds.
Specifically, this concerned the possibility of offering training to pedagogical staff from schools
that do not belong to the Polish National Schools and schools with integrated Polish classes, as part
of lifelong learning. The proposed amendment was designed to accommodate the requirements of the
region’s teaching staff. The option of cross-border education was also expressly incorporated in the
Foundation deeds (Article 14 (b) of the Charter).
f) Support for the teaching and study of minority languages
During the period from 2008-2010, the Czech Republic again provided resources from its budget
for the teaching and study of regional or minority languages. Information can be found in Part I of
this report.
In 2010 there was a significant change in the Grant programme to support the implementation of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which enabled projects involving not only
Polish and the Těšín dialect as its regional dialect, but also the Slovak, German and Romani
languages to be submitted to civic associations and schools. One of the measures was to support
20

Resolution of the Government of the CR no. 1574 of 7 December 2005 on the proposal for the ratification of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ETS 148), opened for signature by the Member States of the
Council of Europe in Strasburg on 5 November 1992

20

educational activities at all levels of educational beyond basic education, which focus on teaching
minority languages or which take place in them. This enables schools and organisations belonging
to national minorities to implement educational programmes in minority languages. In 2010 one of
the projects that received support was submitted by the German minority, but ultimately this was
not implemented.
g) Study and research on minority languages at universities
The Grant Agency of the CR, among others, supported the project submitted by the Czech
Language Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the CR no. P406/11/2304, “Confrontational
description of contemporary Slovak and Czech vocabularies (systemic relations and communication
co-existence)” for the period from 2011–2014, which also includes research into the use of Slovak
in the Czech Republic, primarily in the area of legal communication.
Detailed information on research into minority languages taking place in universities can be found
in Part I of this report, and on the study of minority languages in Part III and in the Annex to this
report.
i) Transnational exchanges
Detailed information on transnational exchanges, relating to those languages protected under the
Charter, can be found in Part III of this report.
Article 7, paragraph 2
Protection against the discrimination of minority languages
In September 2009, Act No. 198/2009 Coll., on equal treatment and on legal instruments of
protection against discrimination and on amendments to certain Acts (the Antidiscrimination Act)
came into force in the CR, which, although it does not directly ban discrimination on the basis of
language, nonetheless does prohibit direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic
origin or nationality.
Article 7, paragraph 3
Promotion of mutual understanding between linguistic groups
The World Roma Festival KHAMORO has been held since 1999 and during this time it has
supported a number of important personalities. During its existence the KHAMORO festival has
become the most important event of its kind, not only in the CR, but also in Europe as a whole.
From 23 to 29 May 2010, the 12th Annual World Roma Festival KHAMORO 2010 was held in
Prague. It was opened under the auspices of the Mayor of the Capital City of Prague and the
Government Commission for Human Rights. Following tradition, the City of Prague was partner
and the festival was supported by the Ministry of Culture, ČEPRO and others.
The implementation of the festival and programme content were carried out as planned and
according to schedule. The 12th annual festival was again judged to be extremely successful, both
on the part of the organisers and on the part of the public. The main objective of the festival was to
introduce to the public the very best of Romani culture from around the world. According to the
public response, the media campaign was of high quality and served not only to draw attention to
the festival itself, but also to efforts to improve relations between the Roma minority and the
majority population. All the planned goals were met and the KHAMORO 2010 festival
contributed, through its cultural and professional programme, to the common co-existence between
Roma and non-Roma and to the discovery of Romani culture.
21

Objectives:
o To show the richness and diversity of Romani culture and traditions, which form an important
part of Czech, European and world culture
o To contribute to the integration of Roma into Czech society and to the creation of a
multicultural society
o To contribute to improving and development relations between the majority population and the
Romani community using cultural and professional events to show the positive values, which
music and other art forms undoubtedly represent
The cultural component of the programme
The cultural part of the programme was attended by the best Roma musicians from around the
world and presented the Czech and foreign public with classic, as well as traditional and
contemporary Roma music or Gypsy jazz. At the same time there were two exhibitions, dance
workshops and film screenings.
Unusually, the music programme was launched on Sunday 23 May 2010, when Švandovo divadlo
in Prague 5 hosted the world premiere of the Roma opera Invisible Gipsy by the Serbian multi-genre
artist, Zoran Tairović. The opera offered the audience an insight into the problems that arise in
relations between different cultures and outlined the issue of tolerance and mutual respect. The
premiere was extremely successful and aroused enormous interest, not only from the public, but
also from the media.
Article 7, paragraph 4
Consultation mechanisms
Those speaking regional or minority languages may use the options enacted in the legislation to
participate actively in addressing issues relating to national minorities through the committees and
at meetings of the Council. Part I of this report sets out specific examples reflecting the needs
expressed by those speaking regional or minority languages.
Article 7, paragraph 5
Application of the principles to non-territorial languages
Given that no changes have been made regarding this point during the period under review, please
refer to the information set out in Part II of the Initial Periodic Report submitted to the Secretary
General of the Council of Europe in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter.

Information on legislative and/or practical measures adopted by the state to implement the challenges and
recommendations of the Committee of Experts, which were introduced in the first evaluation report.

In December 2009 the government approved the Concept for Roma Integration for the period from
2010–2013. This is a strategic document, in which the CR undertakes to support research and
teaching of the Romani language, the creation of methodological and didactic materials and aids for
teaching Romani; and to support literature written in Romani. Additional information on measures
adopted can be found in Part I of this report.

Please indicate the steps that have been taken with regard to the regional or minority languages selected at the
moment of ratification of the Charter, as follows from Article No.2, paragraph 2 of the Charter (legislative and practical
measures)

Languages: POLISH, SLOVAK
The undertakings listed below assumed in respect of Polish apply in the Frýdek-Místek and Karviná
districts of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The undertakings assumed in respect of Slovak apply in
the whole territory of the Czech Republic.
Article 8 – Education
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of education:
Polish: paragraph 1a)i/ii; b)i/ii; c)i/ii; d)ii; e)iii; f)iii; g); h); i); paragraph 2 (10 items in total).
Slovak: paragraph 1a)iv; b)iv; e)iii; g); i); paragraph 2 (6 items in total)
Pre-school education
Paragraph 1) With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used,
according to the situation of each of these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of
the State
a)
i
to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
ii
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education in the relevant regional or minority
languages; or
iv
if the public authorities have no direct competence in the field of pre-school education, to favour
and/or encourage the applications of the measures referred to under i – iii above;

In the 2010/2011 academic year, pre-school education in Polish and Czech was provided by 5
kindergartens in the Moravian-Silesian Region (Písek u Jablunkova, Milíkov u Jablunkova,
Vendryně, Třinec and Český Těšín) with a total of 197 pupils and education in Polish was provided in
a total of 20 kindergartens (with 712 children). In comparison with 2009, there were five fewer
children in these kindergartens. All statistical data on schools, children and pupils are gathered by the
Institute for information in education, an organisation directly managed by the Ministry of Education,
Youth and Sport. The information provided below is valid to 30 March 2010.
Primary education
b)

i
ii
iv

to make available primary education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
to make available a substantial part of primary education in the relevant regional or minority
languages; or
to apply one of the measures provided for under i - iii above at least to those pupils whose
families so request and whose number is considered sufficient;

One primary school providing instruction in Czech and German has been opened in the Czech
Republic, teaching 126 pupils in 5 classes. Compared to 2009 there are an additional 2 pupils.
Apart from the school mentioned above, German is also taught in primary schools as a foreign
language and this option is also available to pupils from the German minority. Some primary
schools offer German language instruction from the first class (e.g. K Milíčova, Kladská and
Bernard Bolzan primary school in Tábor).
1,611 pupils in 112 classes were taught in 21 Polish primary schools (some provide full primary
education while others only provide for the first five years). Compared to 2009 the number of
pupils fell by 9, the number of independent schools decreased by 3 while the number of classes has
remained the same. All schools with instruction in Polish in the Moravian-Silesian region are
23

located on the territory of the Frýdek-Místek and Karviná districts, where the concentration of
Polish-speaking population is highest. All Polish school facilities are included in the register of
schools. Their task is to educate Czech citizens of Polish nationality, in accordance with the
education programmes, but in their mother tongue and with some additional specific subjects. A
recommendation was issued by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport in the form of a
Framework curriculum for schools providing instruction in Polish with effect from 1 September
2007.

Members of national minorities are entitled to education in their minority language, under the
conditions stipulated in Section 14 of Act No. 561/2004 Coll., on pre-school, primary, secondary,
higher vocational and other education (hereinafter referred to as the Education Act), as amended.
In addition to laying down the rules for establishing schools providing instruction in national
minority languages, the Education Act provides for the option where, to support the interests of
members of national minority, a head teacher with the consent of the founder may specify in the
school educational programme subjects or their parts which may be taught bilingually, both in the
Czech language and in the language of the relevant national minority. It also states that at schools
with instruction in the language of the relevant national minority, school reports, apprenticeship
certificates, and diplomas on completion of education shall be issued bilingually, both in the Czech
language and in the language of the relevant national minority.
In accordance with the introduction of the new model of school-leaving examination from the
2010/2011 academic year, the Education Act guarantees that pupils of schools and classes taught in the
language of a national minority shall be entitled to take the common as well as the profile part of the
school-leaving examination either in the Czech language or the language of the relevant national
minority (Polish), with the exception of the examination of the Czech language and literature.
At present 17 six-year “bilingual” grammar schools exist in the Czech Republic, piloting education
under the Framework Educational Programme and the school educational programme for bilingual
grammar schools (this experimental verification has been spread over the period from 2007 to 2015): 6
Czech-Spanish, 5 Czech-French, 1 Czech-Italian, 2 Czech-English, 3 Czech-German. Two CzechGerman bilingual grammar schools have been established on the basis of cooperation with the Austrian
Republic (Prague, Znojmo), 1 Czech-German school in Liberec has been established on the basis of an
intergovernmental agreement with Germany.
German
There were 5 secondary schools offering instruction in German in the Czech Republic, attended by
a total of 757 students in 40 classes (in 2009 781 pupils were taught in 38 classes).

Many activities take place during leisure time.
implemented in 2010:

The following are examples of projects

Odmalička (from childhood) – the aim of the project is to ensure long term and regular meetings
of Czech and German children up to the age of 6 years and these make an important contribution to
bringing people together in transfrontier regions. The project follows on from previous years.
Czech and Bavarian kindergartens can also apply to Tandem for financial assistance for CzechGerman projects aimed at meetings between children under the age of 6, an exchange of
experiences between the kindergarten teaching staff and learning the language of a neighbouring
country. In 2010 Tandem received 240,000 CZK from the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport
of the CR and 10,000 EUR from the Bavarian State Chancellery for this activity.
Sousedé se stávají přáteli/Aus Nachbarn werden Freunde (neighbours become friends) – this is
a project aimed at encouraging Czech-German collaboration between children and young people
from the Plzeň and Karlovy Vary region and the Bavarian region of Upper Franconia. The aim of
the project is to create and strengthen lasting relationships, a network of contacts and to encourage
25

workers and young people to meet and work together. The organisation of a large number of
German-Czech activities, as well as increasing the number of organisations working together is
intended to create close, sustainable and personal cross-border contacts which are so important for
regional development in a united Europe.
Škola bez hranic (school without borders) – Hrádek nad Nisou/Hartau – an experiment has
been carried out through cross-border cooperation between the Hrádek nad Nisou primary school
and a private school in Hartau, Saxony. This project basically consists of intensive meetings
between pupils and pupil exchanges. Around 24 Czech and 20 German children are participating in
the project. In the classes in Hrádek nad Nisou involved in this experiment, instruction is provided
in German from the first year, or from kindergarten, while Czech is taught in the school in Hartau.
At present, music, art and physical education are taught alternately in the neighbouring language
in Hrádek nad Nisou and Hartau once a week.
Several similar projects are underway in the Czech-Saxony border area. These include education
for children from mixed marriages, or for children whose parents are of German ancestry.
Polish
If we only take into account secondary schools providing instruction in Polish, up to 351 pupils
studied in one Polish grammar school in 13 classes in 2010 (compared to 2009 there are 31 fewer
pupils and the number of classes decreased by one). A total of 98 students studied in two secondary
vocational schools, a business college and a secondary nursing school. No pupils are studying in
either the first or the second year of the secondary nursing school and there are no pupils in the first
year of the business college. All three secondary schools are located in the Moravian-Silesian
region.

The Society of Polish Teachers in the Czech Republic, in cooperation with the Pedagogical Centre
for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín, implemented the first part of a project in 2010, financed
to a total of 110,000 CZK from the grant programme to support education in languages of national
minorities and multicultural education. The project aims to supplement and replace textbooks for
schools providing instruction in Polish in the fields of Polish language, history, geography and
biology. In 2010 a working group was established to assess the most suitable textbooks to be
provided to schools (expected in 2011).
Education in higher education institutions
e)

iii

if, for reason of the role of the State in relation to higher education institutions, sub-paragraphs
i and ii cannot be applied, to encourage and/or allow the provision of university or other forms
of higher education in regional or minority languages or of facilities for the study of these
languages as university or higher education subjects;

In accordance with Act No. 111/1998 Coll., on higher education institutions and on changes in and
amendments to other Acts, the competence of the ministry in this regard is clearly defined in
Section 87 of the Act and the organisation of study programmes is entirely the responsibility of the
universities and their autonomy is guaranteed under this Act.
Universities do organise this type of study programme. According to the Act referred to above they
may run study programmes in languages other than Czech, in other words in regional and minority
languages – however, given the higher cost of providing this type of study programme, the
universities are entitled to charge fees for them. Nonetheless, at Charles University in Prague for
example, courses in Polish and Slovak are offered to students attending all the faculties, not only
students in departments where they specialise in these languages.

Most international agreements with the countries of origin of the national minorities in the Czech
Republic include arrangements for scholarships for summer language courses. Other scholarships
are used by philologists/translators (students and teachers), or students of departments that include
language courses (courses on geography, international relations, etc.). Bilateral agreements also
offer direct or indirect support for language teaching.
Support for projects directed at the socially disadvantaged and members of national minorities as
part of grant programmes and university studies.
When securing support for studies for members of the national minorities and members of the
Roma community in accredited university study programmes, the principle of indirect support is
applied and the provisions of Section 18 paragraph 3 of Act No. 111/1998 Coll., on higher
education institutions and on amendments and supplements to other Acts (Act on Higher Education
Institutions), as amended, are followed, i.e. that grants to support projects for members of the
national minorities and members of the Romani community are provided to legal entities (i.e. higher
education institutions).
The decisive factor for deciding the amount of the grants is the long-term educational and scientific,
research, developmental or artistic plan or other creative activities developed by the HEI and their
annual update, the type and cost of accredited study and lifelong learning programmes, the number
of students and the results obtained in educational and scientific, research, developmental, artistic or
other creative activities and their level of complexity.
Public HEIs may apply for a grant in the form of projects submitted under the development
programmes announced by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport.

Adult and continuing education
f)

iii

if the public authorities have no direct competence in the field of adult education, to favour
and/or encourage the offering of such languages as subjects of adult and continuing education;

On the basis of Section 108 paragraph 3 of Act No. 435/2004 Coll. on Employment, as amended,
the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport awards accreditations for organising retraining courses.
These are training programmes that reflect labour market needs. The accreditation commission for
accreditation of an educational programme to provide retraining is an advisory body to the ministry
and assess applications for accreditation. There is currently no valid accreditation for retraining
programmes that cover training in minority languages. Any application in the field of adult training
in a minority language will be assessed in accordance with the law.
A number of projects for the continuing education of pedagogical staff have received funding
through the Support for education in minority languages and multicultural education grant
programme and from the European structural funds. Many seminars have been accredited by the
ministry and the list is available on its website.21 Continuing education of pedagogical staff is also
carried by an organisation directly managed by the Ministry of Education, the National Institute for
Further Education (NIFE), and information on individual projects can be found on its website22.
The Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín
The Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín (hereinafter referred to as the
Pedagogical Centre) is an organisation directly managed by the ministry, which covers the needs of
schools in the CR with Polish as the language of instruction and also the further growth of
pedagogical staff in these facilities in close connection with the ministry’s tasks for schools and
educational facilities, which include:
•

Support for minority education – this primarily concerns the provision of information,
methodological assistance in implementing the Framework Educational Programmes, the
publication and distribution of methodological aids – the Jutrzenka magazine for the first level
and Ogniwo for the second level of primary schools. The Pedagogical Centre collaborated in
the drafting and printing of the Polish version of school reports, academic records and other
documentation and provided advisory services together with pedagogical services and a multimedia library.

•

Further training of pedagogical staff was carried out in collaboration with pedagogical
associations and companies and with the active cooperation of institutions from the CR and
Poland. Part of this training also involved professional methodological activities to support
training which helped to inform pedagogical staff of the latest trends and innovations in
teaching and provided consultations with the methods used by partner institutions. The
preparation of sample lessons and international meetings to discuss methodology was also
stimulating.

•

Life-long learning – the Centre also offers courses for pedagogical staff who are already of
retirement age but who continue to work in schools as substitutes for teachers on maternity
leave or with long-term illnesses. It also continues to offer educational activities for parents.

•

European cooperation – the main projects in this field were “Euroregion Colour Trail” (a
project focusing on the area of regional education), An Interactive Triangle (NAEP, subprogramme GRUNDTVIG) and others.

Teaching of history and culture
g)

to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the culture which is reflected by the
regional or minority language;

Education in schools and school facilities follows the school educational programmes derived from
the relevant Framework Educational Programmes, which set specific goals, the form, the length and
the mandatory educational content.
The Framework Educational Programmes include topics that reflect the regional or minority
language. During the “cyclical” revisions of the Framework Educational Programmes, it is
expected that the history and culture of minorities living in the CR will be further expanded on.
Schools receive financial support to implement school educational programmes focusing on topics
that reflect regional or minority languages, for example through the grant programme of the
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport to support education in minority languages and
multicultural education.
In 2008 funding was provided for a project by the Congress of Poles in the CR, entitled: You pose
the questions, we answer. Educational activities for multicultural education in Těšín Silesia, which
aimed to improve the quality of knowledge of primary and secondary school pupils in the historic
and multicultural traditions and wealth of Těšín Silesia. The Congress of Poles in the CR organised
7 lectures using audiovisual equipment. These lectures were attended by over 200 people, who had
the opportunity to learn and deepen their knowledge of regional history, famous people and the
present-day Těšín region. The lectures also dealt with the issue of introducing European standards
to the Czech Republic and the role of the Congress of Poles in the CR in this process. A graphic
design for an interactive CD which can be used for teaching was also developed. This project
continued in 2009 with lectures in schools and other institutions.
Teacher training
h)

to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to implement those of paragraphs a - g
accepted by the Party,

The Pedagogical Centre for Polish National Schools in Český Těšín (an organisation directly fun by
the ministry) continued to offer courses for teachers from Polish minority schools during the period
under review. Continuing training for teachers is also offered by the Polish Teachers Association
(Towarzystwo Nauczycieli Polskich), a professional organisation of teachers from Polish schools in
the Těšín area, cooperating with the Polish and Czech Education Ministries.
Supervision, monitoring and reporting obligations
i)

to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the measures taken and progress
achieved in establishing or developing the teaching of regional or minority languages and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings, which will be made public.

The Council performs the function of a monitoring body for issues concerning national minorities,
including the use of minority languages, although it has no executive powers. The result of the
monitoring are the annual Reports on the Situation of National Minorities, debated by the
government and published on the internet. The supervisory function is performed by the Ministry
of Education, Youth and Sport.
Czech School Inspectorate
The Czech School Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the Inspectorate) is an administrative
body with national jurisdiction, which carries out evaluations of education in school facilities. The
Inspectorate obtains and analyses information on the education of children, pupils and students, on
30

the activities of schools and school facilities entered in the register of schools (all of the schools
referred to in this documentation that provide instruction to pupils in minority languages are entered
in the register of schools), monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of the educational system,
detects and assess teaching conditions, the teaching programme and educational results according to
the relevant school educational programmes, identifies and evaluates fulfilment of the school
educational programme and its compliance with legal regulations and the Framework Educational
Programme, carries out state control of compliance with legal regulations relating to the provision
of education and school services; state control is exercised in accordance with a special legal
regulation, etc.
The output from the inspection activities is generally an inspection report and the annual report of
the Czech School Inspectorate. Both reports are public.
○ Czech School Inspectorate report on national education in the Moravian-Silesian region (2009/2010)
The area of Polish national education is one of the priorities of the Moravian-Silesian region and is
traditionally referred to in the region’s long-term education plans. All schools with instruction in
Polish are located in the Frýdek-Místek and Karviná districts, where the concentration of Polishspeaking population is highest. Their task is to educate Czech citizens of Polish nationality, in
accordance with the educational programmes, but in their mother tongue.
Schools providing instruction in Polish are assessed, in the same way as Czech schools, on a
cyclical basis, i.e. at least a three-year inspection cycle. The inspection rating is basically based on
the principle of legality. The impact of the Education Act and its changes in school practices are
assessed. During the period under review, the Czech School Inspectorate carried out its work in
accordance with the Plan of main tasks for the 2009/2010 academic year and the inspection rating
was based on the Evaluation Criteria for the conditions, course and results of education (in both
cases these are key Czech School Inspectorate documents approved by the ministry). The
inspectors focused in particular on the following selected areas of schools’ educational activities:
the implementation of the principle of equal access to education, the effectiveness of support for the
development of the personality of children and pupils and progress in literacy and numeracy levels
at all stages of education. The inspection proceeded to make the first formal assessment of the new
school educational programmes in pre-school, primary and secondary education. The aim of the
inspection was to uncover any problems existing in schools and to determine whether the level of
any risk identified warranted state intervention. Traditionally the activities of the Inspectorate have
also focused on inspections of the health and safety elements of schools. In accordance with Act
No. 320/2001 Coll. on financial control in public administration and on amendment to Acts (Act on
financial control), as amended, the statutory control investigated the practical, economical and
efficient management of resources and funds provided to the schools from the state budget. The
course and outcome of the educational process was assessed in terms of the quality of teaching.
Most important was the evaluation of the education provided under the new school educational
programmes and the knowledge obtained concerning their impact on the learning outcomes for
children and pupils.
No major risk that would require systemic or other remedial measures was identified during the
inspection of schools providing instruction in Polish. No breach of legal regulations was recorded
and no incidental inspection activities were performed.
The number of pupils in primary schools was almost the same as in the previous period. In three
primary schools (in the municipalities of Košařiska, Ropice, Stonava) there are separate classes
teaching in both Czech and in Polish. The operation of this model of co-existence is mainly due to
the positive approach taken by the municipal and school authorities to the needs of pupils who are
members of the Polish national minority and to their legal representatives. To date the experience
in the municipalities referred to above has been positive.
31

There was a sharper decline in the number of pupils attending secondary schools such as grammar
schools. Another secondary school with classes taught in Polish is the Business Academy, Český
Těšín, Sokola Tůmy 12, a state-subsidised organisation, which also experienced a fall in pupil
numbers. In the Secondary Nursing School, Karviná, a state-subsidised organisation, there are now
only two classes where teaching in Polish language and literature has been organised for some of
the pupils. Even here there was a significant decrease in the number of pupils.
○ Czech School Inspectorate – evaluation of Czech-German schools in the Czech Republic
In terms of the level of education, the schools were mainly evaluated positively. The Primary
School for German-Czech understanding and the Thomas Mann grammar school, o.p.s., set
challenging but realistic goals for language teaching and create excellent personal and material
conditions for their pupils and numerous opportunities for language development. Its teaching
programme successfully builds on its many years of experience in teaching both Czech and German
pupils in German and the effective exploitation of cooperation between its Czech and foreign
partners. The plan for further developments in the school’s language teaching is not only based on
tradition but also reflects current trends in the state educational policy for foreign languages. The
school meets the formal educational requirements set out in selected provisions of the Education
Act.
The management of the German School in Prague s.r.o. has been successful in its aim to create a
multicultural school environment of pupils of different nationalities. The management of the school
works well and cooperation with different partners at various levels reflects its international
importance. Since 1 September 2007, starting from the first year, the school has created a School of
Czech-German Educational Encounters in an eight-year grammar school following its own school
educational programme (SEP). The school educational programme has been drawn up in
accordance with the Framework Educational Programme for primary education and with the
requirements of the Education Act. It truly takes account of the real conditions and possibilities of
the school, with its excellent facilities. Its application of cooperative learning, varied methods and
forms of work, its method of running extracurricular activities and its use of the diversity of its
pupils (teaching tolerance) is an example of good practice. The overall standard of the school is
above average and its focus gives it a special position amongst Prague secondary schools.
The F. X. Šalda grammar school provides new applicants and pupils following its curriculum equal
access to education, lays down conditions for their healthy development and uses an effective
preventive strategy to avoid the emergence of pathological social behaviour. Its extremely well
prepared strategic document, School educational programme for the F. X. Šalda grammar school
meets the objectives set out in the Framework Educational Programme for grammar schools.
School planning is systematic. The work of the school management is well above standard.
Cooperation with partners is effective and significantly promotes the school’s development.
Attention is regularly paid to the personnel and material aspects of the school, reflecting their
importance in the education process, and these are of very high quality. The standard of teaching in
all the subjects monitored is at a very high level. Pupils studying at this school achieve very good
results over the long term. The way the school works with the pupils’ academic results is
exemplary. Support for literacy shows the positive results achieved by using a variety of activities
when working with texts and in the varied organisation of teaching units, particularly in the
educational field of “Language and language communication”. There are reserves in the systematic
adoption of measures to develop literacy skills and in links to other subjects. The integration of
environmental education and awareness into school life contributes to the development of key
competencies for the pupils and has a positive impact on them.
The Austrian grammar school in Prague o.p.s., creates a safe environment for education. It pays
great attention to supporting pupils’ personal development and lays down the conditions for its
successful application in an international environment. It effectively uses the funds it receives to
32

improve the academic environment for the school’s pupils. The principles and objectives of the
Education Act are met in the implementation of its educational programme. A level playing field is
systematically created for all pupils both during the course of their education and when they are
accepted into the school. Pupils’ academic results are assessed in accordance with established rules
of evaluation. The level of pupils’ knowledge meets the requirements of the school educational
programme. The systematic approach taken by the school management, its realistic strategy, its
focus on planning and meeting its objectives result in improvements to the quality of the learning
process and academic results.
Deficiencies were also identified in the school –school documentation, with some exceptions, is not
kept in Czech, within the meaning of the provisions of Section 28 paragraph 1 of the Education Act;
two of the three dates for entrance examinations were in breach of the provisions of Section 3
paragraph 1 of Decree No. 671/2004 Coll., laying down the details of the organisation of
admissions procedures in secondary schools.
The personnel records of pedagogical staff, with the exception of Czech teachers, does not allow for
an assessment of their compliance with the legislation establishing the conditions for professional
qualifications because it does not contain validated documentation attesting to a level of education
abroad. Individual educational plans did not meet the requirements stipulated in Section 5
paragraph 2 of Decree No. 13/2005 Coll. on secondary education and education in conservatoires.
The Dr. Karel Polesný grammar school in Znojmo provides instruction in accordance with the valid
teaching materials for grammar school subjects. Pupils in the first year of the extended grammar
school are taught according to the school’s own school educational programme, whose content
complies with the Framework Educational Programme for basic education. Funding was
effectively used to improve the quality of the educational process. The school management has set
realistic objectives for its long-term plans. The environment and classroom areas, the didactic
equipment and aids, their use and the conceptual planning for improvements to the school’s
material and technical base lays down excellent conditions in general for the implementation of
grammar school educational programmes. The school’s internal environment and the general
atmosphere promote creativity and have a positive impact on the process of change in education.
The level of pupils admitted into education and the school’s cooperation with its partners are above
average. Even using frontal teaching methods, teachers were able successfully to engage students
in acquiring new knowledge in the classes inspected. The teachers mainly concentrated on a
professional standard of teaching, paying less attention to developing communication skills, team
work, cooperation and interaction between pupils. The low level of stress characterised the mutual
respect shown between teachers and pupils. In certain areas the school is above average, but there
are still a majority of areas in which there are opportunities for further development.
Education in territories where minority languages are not traditionally used
Paragraph 2) With regard to education and in respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority
languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it,
to allow, encourage or provide teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the appropriate stages of education.

Detailed information on this paragraph can be found in Part I, 4 (A) of this report.
Article 9 – Judicial authorities
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings:
paragraph 1a)ii; a)iii; a)iv; b)ii; b)iii; c)ii; c)iii; d); paragraph 2a) (9 items in total)
Paragraph 1) The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which the number of residents using the
regional or minority languages justified the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the present paragraph is not considered by the judge
to hamper the proper administration of justice:

33

The use of minority languages in criminal proceedings
a)

in criminal proceedings
ii
to guarantee the accused the right to use his/her regional or minority language; and/or
iii
to provide that requests and evidence, whether written or oral, shall not be considered
inadmissible solely because they are formulated in a regional or minority language; and/or
iv
to produce, on request, documents connected with legal proceedings in the relevant regional or
minority language, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations involving no extra
expense for the person concerned;

Act No. 141/1961 Coll., on criminal judicial proceedings, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the
“Code of Criminal Procedure”) states that in cases where it is necessary to translate a document, a
statement or another act in the context of criminal proceedings, or where the accused invokes
his/her rights under Section 2 paragraph 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, an interpreter must
be appointed; the same rule applies in situations where an interpreter has to be appointed for
someone who is able to communicate only in sign language.
The rules concerning the appointment of interpreters, their qualifications and the circumstances that
disqualify an interpreter, the right to refuse to interpret the proceedings, the interpreter's pledge and
the requirement that the interpreter must be informed about his duties before commencing the
interpretation, as well as the rules on the compensation for the expenses incurred by the interpreter
and on the interpreter's fee, are contained in special legislation – Act No. 36/1967 concerning
interpreters and forensic experts as amended, and Justice Ministry Regulation No. 37/1967
implementing the Interpreters and Forensic Experts Act. The central register of interpreters and
forensic experts is kept by the Ministry of Justice of the CR.
Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the costs of proceedings paid by the
State include the costs necessary for the conduct of criminal proceedings, including enforcement
proceedings.
It is hoped that a sufficient number of qualified Romani interpreters will be recruited from among
the graduates of Roma studies university programmes. A Romani course (bachelor and master) is
taught as part of the Philology study programme at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in
Prague (Roma Studies Seminar at the South and Central Asia Institute). The Faculty of Education
of Masaryk University in Brno offers Romani courses open to all students (two teaching hours per
week in the winter and summer semesters); the Faculty of Education of Charles University in
Prague (Special Education Department) teaches Roma studies and Romani as part of the Special
Education study programme.
The use of minority languages in civil proceedings
b)

in civil proceedings
ii
to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court, that he or she may use his
or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring additional expense; and/or
iii
to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or minority languages, if
necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

According to Section 18 of Act No. 99/1963 Coll., the Code of Civil Procedure, as amended, the
parties are entitled to communicate with the court in their mother tongue. The costs associated with
the party’s use of his/her mother tongue are paid by the State (Section 141, paragraph 2).
The use of minority languages in proceedings concerning administrative matters
c)

in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters
ii
to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court, that he or she may use his
or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring additional expense; and/or
iii
to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or minority languages, if
necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

34

d)

to take steps to ensure that the application of sub-paragraphs i and iii of paragraphs b and c above and
any necessary use of interpreters and translations does not involve extra expense for the persons
concerned.

The Code of Administrative Justice (Act No. 150/2002 Coll.) regulates the possibility of using a
language other than Czech, in the sense that the court is obliged to provide all parties with equal
opportunities for the exercise of their rights. The costs incurred as a result of the appointment of
interpreters are paid by the State (Section 36, paragraph 2). According to the Code of
Administrative Justice, Section 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies also in cases of
administrative litigation under private law.
The facilities for the exercise of the right to use one’s mother tongue when communicating with
judicial authorities in criminal, civil and administrative proceedings are in place and function
without problems.
Validity of legal documents
Paragraph 2) The Parties undertake
a)
not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State solely because they are drafted in a
regional or minority language; or

Czech legislation does not deny the validity of national legal documents issued in regional or
minority languages, and in accordance with Section 16 of the Code of Administrative Procedure
(Act No. 500/2004 Coll., as amended) documents can be submitted in Slovak and, in general, also
in national minority languages. The cost of translation is paid by the administrative authority.
Article 10 – Administrative authorities and public services
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of administrative authorities and public services:
Polish: paragraph 1a)iv; paragraph 2b); e); f); g); paragraph 4a); paragraph 5; (7 items in total)
Slovak: paragraph 1a)iv; a)v; paragraph 2b); e); f); paragraph 3c); paragraph 4a); paragraph 5; (8
items in total)
The use of minority languages within the administrative districts of the State
Paragraph 1) Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number of residents who are users of regional or
minority languages justified the measures specified below and according to the situation of each language, the Parties
undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible
a)
iv
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may submit oral or written applications in
these languages; or
v to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may validly submit a document in these
languages;

The issue of filing documents is regulated by Section 16 of the Code of Administrative Procedure
(Act No. 500/2004 Coll., as amended). In administrative proceedings, documents may generally be
submitted in either Czech or Slovak. Filings written in a foreign language must be submitted by a
participant in their original along with their officially certified translation into the Czech language
unless the administrative body informs the participant that such translation is not required. Such
information may be posted by an administrative body with respect to future proceedings on the
official notice board.
The issue of the language of oral applications is also addressed in Section 16 of the Code of
Administrative Procedure. A citizen of the Czech Republic who belongs to a national minority
traditionally and for a long time established in the territory of the Czech Republic shall have the
right to use the language of such minority in oral hearings and for written filings. Where the
35

respective administrative body has no officials competent to speak the language of the minority, the
citizen, shall by himself arrange for the services of an interpreter entered in the official list of
certified interpreters. The costs of interpreting and costs of translation in such a case shall be borne
by the administrative body.
Information provided by the public administration to people using regional or minority languages of
an election or a local referendum in the languages of those national minorities
Paragraph 2) In respect of the local or regional authorities on whose territory the number of residents who are users of
regional or minority languages is such as to justify the measures specified below, the Parties undertake to allow and/or
encourage
b)
the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to submit oral or written applications in these
languages;
e)
the use by regional authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in their assemblies, without
excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;
f)
the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in their assemblies, without
excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;

Pursuant to Section 10, Act No. 273/2001 Coll., on rights of members of national minorities,
members of national minorities traditionally and for a long time living in the territory of the Czech
Republic shall not only have the right to the publication of notification of the time and place of
elections, under the conditions set out in the electoral law23, but also to additional information for
voters in the language of the national minority (in municipalities where at least 10% of the
population living within its territorial jurisdiction claimed a nationality other than Czech at the last
census and in regions where at least 5% of the population living within its territorial jurisdiction
claimed a nationality other than Czech at the last census). Prior to every election, the Ministry of
the Interior sends information on the method of voting in the language of the relevant national
minorities to every municipality where citizens claiming a nationality other than Czech make up at
least 10% of the population of the municipality (Committees for national minorities are established
in these municipalities), which goes beyond the obligations imposed on it under electoral law.
Information on the method of voting in the language of national minorities is published in the
municipalities concerned in the usual place for this i.e. for the most part it is posted on the official
notice board of the municipal authority, as well as in each polling station on the territory of the
municipality.
A similar principle for providing information to members of national minorities applies when local
referenda are held as for elections. In accordance with the provisions of Section 31, paragraph 3 of
Act No. 22/2004 Coll., on local referenda and on amendments to certain Acts, as amended and in
accordance with Section 32, paragraph 3, of Act No. 118/2010 Coll., on regional referenda and on
amendments to certain Acts, as amended, in municipalities in which a Committee for national
minorities has been established, information concerning the time and place a local referendum is to
be held and concerning the obligation to provide evidence of identity and citizenship when voting,
is also published in the language of the relevant national minority, provided at least 10% of the
population of the municipality claimed a nationality other than Czech at the last census.
The use of traditional place-names
g)

the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the official language(s), of traditional
and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority languages;

23

See Section 15 paragraph 4 of Act No. 247/1995 Coll., on elections to the Parliament of the Czech Republic and on
amendments and supplements to certain other Acts, as amended, the provisions of Section 29 paragraph 3 of Act No.
491/2001 Coll., on elections to representative bodies of muncipalities and on amendments to certain Acts, as amended,
and the provisions of Section 32 paragraph 4 of Act No. 62/2003 Coll., on elections to the European Parliament and on
amendments to certain Acts, Section 27, paragraph 3, Act No. 130/2000 Coll., on elections to regional representative
bodies and on amendments to certain Acts, as amended

36

The Czech Republic is gradually adopting legislative and non-legislative measures for the use of
traditional and correct forms of local place names (see Part I of this report).
The legal requirements for the use of bilingual Czech-Polish place names are met by a total of 31
municipalities on the territory of the Frýdek-Místek and Karviná districts. Since the ratification of the
Charter in 2007, bilingual place names have been installed in two-thirds of these municipalities and
the process of installing these place names is still continuing. Each municipality individually decides
which of its signs and inscriptions should be bilingual, on the basis of recommendations from its
Committee for national minorities. The possibilities are very broad, ranging from name boards on the
buildings of government and local government authorities, through bilingual signs on other publicly
accessible buildings (schools, bus stops, libraries, cultural centres) and street names to varying
extents, to road signs marking the entry to and exit from the municipality. With regard to the
undertakings accepted under the Charter, meetings were held with the Czech Railways, which in
2009, over and above its legal obligations, provided financing for bilingual signs on railway stations
(Návsí/Nawsie). Municipalities with the legally prescribed proportion of members of the Polish
minority can have station names also in Polish in places where the new rail corridor is being built in
the Moravian-Silesian region. However this does not apply to municipalities where no upgrade to
railway stations or bus stops is projected.
The costs incurred by municipalities installing bilingual Czech-Polish signs are paid from the state
budget. In some municipalities, the installation of new bilingual signs has sparked lively debates
between members of the Committee for national minorities and the municipal authorities. The
majority population tends to take a rather reserved approach to bilingual place names and is not
unanimously positive about this new phenomenon in the life of the local or regional communities.
Some Czech-Polish signs have also been destroyed, an issue that has repeatedly been addressed by
the Council committees and the Council itself. The former Minister for Human Rights and
Government Commissioner for Human Rights, Michael Kocáb, publicly protested against this
dangerous phenomenon and also published a number of articles on this subject in the regional press.
The use of minority languages in public services
Paragraph 3) With regard to public services provided by the administrative authorities or other persons acting on their
behalf, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which regional or minority languages are used, in accordance with the
situation of each language and as far as this is reasonably possible:
c)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a request in these languages.

The situation has not changes over the previous period monitored, i.e. no legislative or practical
barriers to the use of minority languages in the public services have been recorded by the public
services.
Translation and interpretation
Paragraph 4) With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 accepted by them, the Parties
undertake to take one or more of the following measures:
a)
translation and interpretation as may be required;

Under the grant programme for the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages, which was established under Government Resolution of 7 December 2005 no.
1574, from the budget of the Office of the Government, one of the thematic areas for support also
included translation and interpreting into regional or minority languages.
The use or adoption of family names in the regional or minority languages
Paragraph 5) The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names in the regional or minority languages, at
the request of those concerned.

37

In the Czech Republic no problem has been recorded to date concerning the use of family names in
original forms conforming to the grammar and orthography of minority languages.
In this context, we would add for completeness that, according to the legislation in force relating to
the use of names and family names24, citizens of the Czech Republic, whose nationality is other
than Czech, may submit a request to use their family name in the masculine form, even
retroactively.
On 1 July 2008, Act No. 239/2008 Coll., amending certain laws related to registered partnerships
entered into force. Part seven was amended by the Act on Registries. The provisions of Section 26
were supplemented by a new paragraph 3, which states that at the request of a citizen of the Czech
Republic who is a member of a national minority and whose name, or names, are entered in the
register in Czech or in a language other than Czech, his/her name, or names, will be entered in the
registry document in the language of the national minority in characters that can be displayed in the
public administration information systems. A record will be made in the register that a registry
document has been issued showing the name, or names, in the language of the national minority.
Subsequent registry documents are issued showing the name, or names, in this form.
Article 11 – Media
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of the media:
Polish: paragraph 1a)iii; b)ii; c)ii; d; e)i; paragraph 2; (6 items in total)
Slovak: paragraph 1a)iii; b)ii; d; e)i; paragraph 2; (5 items in total)
Radio and television broadcasts in minority languages
Paragraph 1) The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional and minority languages within the territories in which
those languages are spoken, according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public authorities, directly
or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media,
a)
to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service mission:
iii
to make adequate provision so that broadcasters offer programmes in the regional or minority
languages;
b)
ii
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio programmes in the regional or minority
languages on a regular basis;
c)
ii
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in the regional or
minority languages on a regular basis;

Act No. 231/2001 Coll., on radio and television broadcasting, imposes an obligation on the
broadcaster to structure its range of programmes to ensure that its broadcast provides a balanced
offer for the entire population, having regard to their age, gender, colour of skin, creed, religion,
political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin and membership of a minority.
The obligation to broadcast radio and television programmes in minority languages is also regulated
by Act No. 483/1991 Coll., on Czech Television and Act No. 484/1991 Coll., on Czech Radio.
These regulations impose similar obligations on both public media, these being:
a) to create and broadcast programmes and to provide a balanced offer of programmes that is
targeted at all groups of the population and takes into account their freedom of religious faith and
conviction as well as culture, ethnic or national origin, national identity, social background, age and
sex, to ensure that the aforementioned channels and programmes reflect diversity of opinion as well

24

Section 69 of Act No. 301/2000 Coll., on registry offices, names and surnames and on amendments to certain related
Acts, as amended, (hereinafter referred to as the “Act on Registries”), as amended by Act No. 165/2004 Coll.

38

as of political, religious, philosophical and artistic trends, and thus enhance mutual understanding
and tolerance and foster the cohesion of a pluralistic society,
b) to develop the cultural identity of people living in the Czech Republic, including the members of
national or ethnic minorities.
In addition to these statutory arrangements, a programme of support for the dissemination and
reception of information in the languages of the national minorities has been implemented under the
authority of the Ministry of Culture, for which 28,767,000 CZK was allocated from the state budget
in 2008, in 2009 a total of 30,134,000 CZK and in 2010 a total of 18,317,000 CZK. Under this
programme, projects can be submitted for funding for the creation of radio and television
programmes in the languages of the national minorities.
Specific examples of Czech Television programmes:
- Polish broadcasts as part of the regional news, regularly every Friday since 2006 – running time
5 - 6 minutes.
- Romani broadcasts as part of the regional news, every Sunday, as part of iVysílání whenever,
since September 2010 – running time 8 - 10 minutes.
- Other programmes are not targeted broadcasts in minority languages, but relate to them:
- Babylon – programme about and for national minorities, broadcast once a week since 2000,
running time 25 min.
- Open borders - Rozmówki polsko-czeskie – magazine co-financed by the EU concerning the
Czech-Polish border area, broadcast once a week, since September 2010, running time 25
minutes
- Kosmopolis – a magazine focusing on minorities in general (i.e.. also on homosexuals, refugees,
etc.), once a week since 2000, 25 minutes
- The Roma in Europe – to date this has been broadcast 19x, running time 25 minutes.
Support for the production and distribution of audiovisual and audio works in regional or minority
languages
d)

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and audiovisual works in
the regional or minority languages;

Act No. 241/1992 Coll., on the state fund of the Czech Republic for the support and development of
Czech cinematography, assumes that the fund can be used for projects to produce, distribute and
promote cinematographic works by national and ethnic minorities living in the territory of the
Czech Republic. However, most applicants who request financial aid for projects that relate to
issues concerning national and ethnic minorities use general categories for the creation, production
and distribution of cinematographic works and the promotion of cinematography.
Support for printed publications
e)

i

to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at least one newspaper in the
regional or minority languages, or

On the basis of Government Regulation No. 98/2002 Coll., laying down the conditions and manner
of providing subsidies from the state budget for the activities of members of national minorities and
to promote the integration of members of the Romani community, a programme to support the
dissemination and reception of information in the languages of national minorities is managed
under the authority of the Ministry of Culture, and is funded each year from the state budget. Under
the terms of this programme, it is possible on the basis of projects submitted to support the
publication of periodicals in the languages of national minorities or the production of programmes
for radio and television broadcasts in the languages of the national minorities, where the grant may

39

cover up to 70% of the total project budget. In exceptional cases, this share may be increased up to
100%.
In 2008, 30,000,000 CZK was released from the state budget for the grant programme referred to
above, of which:
a) Slovak – a total of 7,075,000 CZK to support four periodicals. Three monthly magazines –
Slovenské dotyky, Korene, Listy and one quarterly Zrkadlenie - Zrcadlení.
b) Polish – a total of 7,958,000 CZK to support the publication of the Głos Ludu newspaper, which
is issued three times each week, a monthly cultural magazine, Zwrot and a magazine destined for
school children, which is published twice a month during the academic year, Nasza gazetka.
c) German – a total of 1,915,000 CZK to support the publication of a newspaper, with two issues a

Romano hangos, a monthly magazine, Romano vodi, an almanac published twice a year, Romano
džaniben and a magazine aimed at Roma children and youth, Kereka.
In 2009, 19,634,000 CZK was released from the state budget for the grant programme referred to
above. This sum was supplemented from the General Treasury Administration chapter and the
Government Budgetary Reserve to give a final sum of 30,134,000 CZK, of which:
a) Slovak – 6,153,000 CZK
The composition of the periodicals is the same. This also includes the sum of 60,000 CZK for the
production of a radio programme as part of the Džavotanie project broadcast by Czech Radio on the
Leonardo station.
b) Polish – 8,055,000 CZK
The same periodicals as in 2008 received funding.
c) German – 2,210,000 CZK
The same periodicals were also supported again here.
d) Romani – 4,495,000 CZK
Here again the same breakdown of periodicals were supported.
A sum of 300,000 CZK was also used to subsidize a project implemented by Czech Television in its
Ostrava studio, entitled Babylon. This is a multicultural magazine with 43 premieres and the same
number of repeats, 20 min running time.
28,571,000 CZK was released from the state budget for the grant programme mentioned above, but
after two cuts only 23,847,000 CZK remained. Of this:
a) Slovak – 4,287,500 CZK
the monthly magazines Listy and Slovenské dotyky were supported, the bimonthly Slovenské Korene
and the Džavotanie project on Czech Radio, the Leonardo station.
b) Polish – 7,163,810 CZK

d) Romani – 3,880,595 CZK
40

The same periodicals and also regional news broadcasts in Romani produced in Czech Television’s
Ostrava studio.
The right to receive broadcasts from neighbouring countries
Paragraph 2) The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in a language used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and not to
oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in such a language. The further
undertake to ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and free circulation of information in
the written press in a language used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise of the
above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities,
conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of
national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
and morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing disclosure of information received in
confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

The operating system for radio and television broadcasts in the Czech Republic complies with the
standards set by the Council of Europe and EU requirements. In addition to the constitutionally
guaranteed rights arising from the European Convention on Human Rights, the European
Convention on Transfrontier Television, the EU Directive on audiovisual media services, as well as
other documents of a facultative nature, these principles are secured.
Article 12 – Cultural activities and facilities
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of cultural activities and facilities:
Polish: paragraph 1a); f); g); paragraph 2; paragraph 3; (5 items in total)
Slovak: paragraph 1a); f); g); paragraph 2; paragraph 3; (5 items in total)
Paragraph 1) With regard to cultural activities and facilities – especially libraries, video libraries, cultural centres,
museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular forms of
cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including inter alia the use of new technologies – the Parties
undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public authorities are
competent, have power or play a role in this field:

Support for cultural activities and participation by users of minority languages in such activities
a)

to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or minority languages and foster the
different means of access to works produced in these languages;

Each year, the Ministry of Culture (Department of regional and national culture) announces a
selection procedure for projects in the Programme to support the activities of members of national
minorities living in the Czech Republic in accordance with Resolution of the Government of the CR
of 21 February 2007 no. 122, as amended by subsequent amendments to grant selection procedures.
In 2008 the funding for this programme totalled 9.96 million CZK, in 2009 it totalled 10.045
million CZK and in 2010 the total was 8.645 million CZK. It was primarily events and activities
organised by civic associations of national minorities that received support, including the activities
of choirs, traditional folk groups, folk art and culture, and others. Under the grant selection
procedure announced by the Independent Department of Literature and Libraries of the Ministry of
Education, Youth and Sport, subsidies are provided to libraries (kept in the records of the Ministry
of Culture, in accordance with Act No. 257/2001 Coll.), to provide access to literature in the
languages of the national minorities (Grant name: 21st century library, subsidy to purchase this
literature); subsidies may also be provided to support the publication of non-periodical literature, by
publishing works in the languages of the national minorities.

Participation of users of minority languages in planning cultural activities
f)

to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a given regional or minority language
in providing facilities and planning cultural activities;

The Ministry of Culture supports the operation and activities of the following institutes: Museum of
Romani culture, Brno, Silesian museum in Opava and now also the Lidice Memorial organisation,
which took over the administration of sacred sites in Lety u Písku and in Hodonín u Kunštátu under
Government Resolution of 4 May 2009 no. 589 and the the administration of the sacred site
commemorating the Roma Holocaust in Lety under Resolution no. 1065 of 8 August 2009 (an
update of a previous resolution).
In terms of its research, documentary and presentation objectives, the Museum of Romani culture
focuses on the Romani language. In this regard, a varied offer of activities for the general or
professional (academic) public takes place in the museum each year. This includes, in particular:
-

-

-

Courses in Romani for the public – (2 - 3 advanced courses during the semester), the publication
of educational materials in Romani, co-organisation of seminars in Romani,
Publication of literature – original Romani and Romani studies, audio and audiovisual media.
Museum library – collects original Romani and also specialised Romani studies literature, the
library and reading room are open to the public free of charge.
Research, documentation, collections and presentations – the research, documentation and
presentation of Romani is one of the museum’s basic activities, while field research is also
carried out on the Romani language (documentation of interviews in the Romani language).
The museum exhibits Romani texts, the permanent exhibition of the Roma story is summarised
in Romani (Northern Central dialect). The museum regularly hosts lectures on the Romani
language both at universities and in the museum itself (from the Who are the Roma? cycle).
Educational activities relating to compulsory school attendance for children – Children’s museum
leisure club for children from neighbouring Romani communities – the club’s activities also include
extra tutoring for children by our mentors and teaching assistants, who use Romani during lessons as
an ancillary language. The Desegregation Project relates the these extra lessons – when museum
mentors care for children transferred from segregated Romani schools to mainstream education, and
here they again use the Romani language for this work.
Professional consultation, research, reports, translations – these are also provided on the Romani
language.
Museum shop – in the museum reception area, containing a number of books in the Romani
language, either literary titles or works on specialised linguistic topics.

The Silesian museum in Opava has made a major contribution to research into the problems of the
Polish minority and the Polish language in the CR. The problems of the Polish minority in the CR
were again an important subject of research by museum staff in 2010, with the results included both in
a number of publications, exhibitions and presentations at academic conferences and lectures for the
public in the CR and in Poland, as well as in exceptionally rich popularising activities in the mass
media. One of the main events in 2010 was the organisation of an exhibition of documents and
photographs entitled “Pamięć Narodu/National remembrance”, which was prepared in both Czech and
Polish to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyň massacre by the Congress of Poles in the
CR and the Silesian museum in collaboration with the Institute of National Remembrance in Warsaw.
It took place from 28 April to 9 May 2010 in the Těšín theatre in Český Těšín and museum staff were
involved in securing exhibits, the digitalisation of documents, specialised preparations and speeches
during the opening ceremony. From 18 May to 15 June 2010, the exhibition was presented at the
World War II monument in Hrabyně under the title “Katyň – memory of the Polish nation”. On the
occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Katyň massacre, whose victims included almost 500 Poles
from the Czech lands, a memorial volume was also published.
42

The Lidice memorial organisation devoted extraordinary efforts over the past two years to integrate
the Lety cultural memorial into the structure of the Lidice memorial organisation (Resolution of the
Government of the Czech Republic no. 589 of 4 May 2009 transferred responsibility for the sacred
site of the former gypsy concentration camp in Lety u Písku to the state supported organisation, the
Lidice memorial) and to ensure compliance with Government Resolution of 4 May 2009 no. 589 on
the arrangements for the sacred sites in Lety u Písku and in Hodonín u Kunštátu. On 18 June 2010,
a newly reconstructed cultural memorial was officially opened on the site of the former gypsy camp
as a dignified sacred landmark, with the installation of two replicas of the original quarters, which
now house a permanent exhibition, the renovation of a nature trail connected to the Information
Centre in the former municipal authority building in Lety and the complete reconstruction of the
access roads to the sacred site, with an entire new set of traffic and information signage. All
information concerning the events relating to this cultural memorial is published on the memorial
website in Romani.
Collecting and archiving works in the regional or minority languages
g)

To encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies responsible for collecting, keeping a copy
of and presenting or publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;

There are no independent archives of works created in minority languages. However, the Ministry
of Culture subsidizes projects to establish documentary centres for the Polish, Slovak and other
minorities. Information on the activities of these centres is published each year on the government
website in the Reports on the situation of national minorities for the relevant year.
Cultural activities in other regions
Paragraph 2) In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally used, the
Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or provide
appropriate cultural activities and facilities in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

The National Information and Advisory Centre for Culture, Prague, an organisation supported by
the Ministry of Culture, contributed to the implementation of Article 12 of the Charter as follows:
a) Slovak
- 2008, 2009, 2010 – a Czech-Slovak meeting between young amateur actors in Šumperk, two
to three workshops (of a total of five) are led by Slovak instructors in Slovak. Workshops
conducted by Czech instructors are also attended by Slovak-speaking participants. An
amateur theatre from Slovakia is also hosted here each year.
-

Articles in the online magazine Local Culture (Místní kultura) the Slovak community
traditionally lives in the Czech Republic (Slovenská komunita žije v Čechách tradičně)
(2008), Neighbours should understand each other (Sousedé by si měli rozumět) (2010).

b) Polish

On 21 June 2007 a National Minorities House was opened in Prague, housing civic associations for
the Bulgarian, Hungarian, German, Polish, Romani, Russian, Ruthenian, Greek, Slovak, Serbian
and Ukrainian minorities. The civic associations (not only those speaking the minority languages
listed) may use the common areas – exhibition hall, conference room, and a common room with
café – to present their particular culture, regardless of the regional affiliation of speakers of minority
languages.
Presentation of the cultures associated with minority languages in pursuing cultural policy abroad
Paragraph 3) The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing their cultural policy abroad, for regional or
minority languages and the cultures they reflect.

The Ministry of Culture (Department of Regional and National Culture) uses a grant programme to
support foreign contacts for amateur artistic activities, not only enabling the presentation of acts in the
minority languages referred to above at prestigious foreign festivals and competitions, but at the same
time significantly contributes to strengthening links between these cultures and languages in countries
where they form a natural part of the majority population. It also helps to spread awareness of Czech
regional and national culture more effectively.
Article 13 – Economic and social life
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of economic and social life:
Polish: paragraph 1c); paragraph 2e); (2 items in total)
Slovak: paragraph 1c); paragraph 2e); (2 items in total)
Protection against the discrimination of minority languages
Paragraph 1) With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, within the whole country
c)
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or minority languages in connection with
economic and social activities;

In September 2009, Act No. 198/2009 Coll., on equal treatment and on legal instruments of
protection against discrimination and on amendments to certain Acts (the Antidiscrimination Act)
came into force in the CR, which enforces the right to equal treatment and non-discrimination, for
example in areas such as the right to employment and to access to employment or entrepreneurship,
access to health care and its provision, access to education and its provision and access to goods and
services. This Act has amended a number of other Acts by adding a provision prohibiting direct
and indirect discrimination on the basis of racial or ethnic origin or nationality.
Information on consumer rights in minority languages
Paragraph 2)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, in so far as the public authorities are competent,
within the territory in which the regional or minority languages are used, and as far as this is reasonably possible
e)
to ensure for information provided by the competent public authorities concerning the rights of
consumers to be made available in regional or minority languages.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade annually publishes a consumer information brochure in foreign
languages, including Polish. In 2005 the Ministry also established a European Consumer Centre to
deal with transfrontier issues, complaints and disputes in the field of consumer protection. The
Centre provides information, inter alia, in Polish and Slovak.

44

Article 14 – Transfrontier exchanges
In respect of Polish and Slovak, the Czech Republic has assumed the following undertakings in the
field of transfrontier exchanges:
Polish: a); b). (2 items in total)
Slovak: a); b). (2 items in total)
Support of transfrontier cooperation
The Parties undertake:
a)
to apply the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind them with the States in which the
same language is used in identical or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude such agreements,
in such a way as to foster contacts between users of the same language in the States concerned in the
fields of culture, education, information, vocational training and lifelong learning;
b)
for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or promote co-operation across
borders, in particular between regional or local authorities in whose territory the same language is used
in identical or similar form.

The Ministry of Culture of the CR, through its representative, participates in the work of the CzechPolish Intergovernmental Commission for Transfrontier Cooperation. The Commission concludes a
protocol containing a plan for transfrontier cooperation. Planned exchanges are supported by
regional and local governments.
Since persons belonging to the Slovak minority are scattered across the whole territory of the Czech
Republic, cultural exchanges between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic do not take the
form of transfrontier exchange. The exchanges are made on the basis of a Cultural Agreement and
Protocols on Cooperation concluded between the Ministries of Culture of the two countries.
Performances by Slovak artists in the Czech Republic always draw large Slovak-speaking audiences.
The Ministry of Culture of the CR also supports the activities of the Slovak-Czech Club civic
association (Slovensko-český klub), which was founded by members of the Slovak minority in the CR
and which organises Slovak Culture Days in various Czech towns each year.
Transfrontier cooperation in the Czech-German border area is relatively extensive. Protocols
negotiated at meetings of the Czech-Saxon and Czech-Bavarian Joint Intergovernmental
Commission regularly feature articles on transfrontier cooperation and exchanges. A good example
of transfrontier cultural cooperation is, for example, the Mitte Europa Festival, which has been held
regularly held on the Czech-German border since 1991 and receives support from the regions and
municipalities, as well as the Ministries of Culture of the CR, Saxony and Bavaria.
