The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages;
Having regard to the instrument of ratification submitted by Denmark on 8 September 2000;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts on the Charter with respect to the
application of the Charter by Denmark;
Bearing in mind that this evaluation is based on information submitted by Denmark in its third periodical

associations legally established in Denmark and the information obtained by the Committee of Experts
during its on-the- spot visit,
Having taken note of the comments made by the Danish authorities on the contents of the Committee of

2.
ensure that the reduction of subsidies for private schools and cuts of the transport allowances will
not jeopardize the continued functioning of the German-language schools at the current level;
3.
clarify the issue of the traditional presence of the Romani language spoken by Sinti and possibly
other indigenous groups in Denmark.
