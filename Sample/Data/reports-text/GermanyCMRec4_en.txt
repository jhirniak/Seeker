The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages;
Having regard to the instrument of ratification submitted by Germany on 16 September 1998;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts on the Charter with respect to the
application of the Charter by Germany;

report, supplementary information given by the German authorities, information submitted by bodies and
associations legally established in Germany and the information obtained by the Committee of Experts
during its on-the- spot visit,
Having taken note of the comments made by the German authorities on the contents of the Committee of
Experts' report;

and, as a matter of priority:

adopt specific legal provisions, where their absence hinders practical implementation of the

not jeopardize the continued functioning of the Danish-language education at the current level;

Frisian and Lower Sorbian, including in particular measures which ensure as a matter of urgency that
primary and secondary education is systematically available in these languages;

ensure that the provision of education in Upper Sorbian is not jeopardized by the changes in the
educational system concerning this language;

upgrade the teaching of Low German to the status of a regular school subject being taught as an
integral part of the curriculum and increase the number of hours devoted to Low German, in the Länder
concerned;
6.
ensure that an effective monitoring mechanism in the sense of the Charter exists in the field of
education for all regional or minority languages covered under Part III;
7.
take resolute action to establish a structured policy for making it possible in practice to use regional
or minority languages in dealings with the administration and, where relevant, in the courts;
8.
take measures so that adequate radio and television broadcasting is available in Danish, Low
German, Lower Sorbian, North Frisian, Romani, Sater Frisian.
