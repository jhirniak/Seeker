General Situation and General Framework

Preliminary Remarks
Given the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the implementation of the
obligations assumed under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is
primarily the responsibility of the Länder. Therefore, the reports on the various activities in
Parts B and C below of the State Report are, for the major part, based on the inputs
contributed by the respective Länder.
1. The Federal Republic of Germany attaches great importance to the protection of regional
or minority languages. On 5 November 1992, it signed the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages (in the following: "the Charter") [cf. Annex 1]. By the
Act [to implement the Charter] of 9 July 1998 (cf. Annex 2), the German Bundestag,
with the consent of the Federal Council [Chamber of the Länder], approved the Charter.
That Act was promulgated in the Federal Law Gazette on 16 July 1998, and the
instrument of ratification was deposited with the Council of Europe on 16 September
1998. The Charter entered into force in Germany on 1 January 1999. Under the Federal
Act ratifying the Charter, the latter ranks, in Germany, as a federal law which takes
precedence over subordinate law, including Land laws [supremacy of federal law], and
as a matter of principle [primacy of international law], is to be applied as the more
specific law overriding other federal laws. National compliance with the Charter is
legally ensured on a comprehensive scale with the implementation of its provisions, as
described in detail in Section A.5 below and in Parts B and C [pp. 16 seqq.].
In ratifying the Charter, the Federal Republic of Germany was guided by the following
considerations:
In many countries of Europe, there is a large number of traditionally spoken languages
which differ from the respective official language or from the language of the majority
population, and - in relation to the entire national territory - are used by a small portion
of the population. This diversity of languages as an essential basis of culture has shaped
the cultural history of Europe. To this day, the cultural wealth of Europe has found, and
still finds, expression in its regional or minority languages. Notwithstanding the great
cultural value of the regional or minority languages, however, the insignificance of
many of these languages increases to the benefit of the language of the majority
population. In public life, especially in the media, and as a legal language and as the
official language, regional or minority languages are used only on a limited scale. Many
languages lose their scope of use as a result of a re-orientation of their traditional users,
voluntary assimilation or the linguistic assimilation policy of the state. Use of these
languages in the private sphere is not sufficient to durably ensure their continued
existence. Europe-wide, regional or minority languages are, to a varying extent,
threatened by extinction or by a drastic loss of their vitality.
For the groups among whom these languages are spoken, their use forges identity. Also,
especially for the national minorities and traditionally resident ethnic groups, the
preservation of the given language and its further development are the basis required for
preserving their culture, tradition and identity. Failure to preserve their independent
language entails the risk of loss of the cultural identity of the speakers of regional or
minority languages. But the decline of regional or minority languages will also imply
for the majority population that an important traditional cultural element of society and
of their country's civilization which has developed over centuries will be lost.

4

However, preservation of this linguistic and cultural diversity does not only mean
maintenance of identity and preservation of a cultural heritage but it also serves
communication within the country and the integration of all citizens into their country
since it requires and exacts tolerance and openness for other languages and cultures.
Therefore, ensuring the diversity of languages has a mediatory function, facilitates
community life and prevents ethnic exclusion. In particular, the protection and
promotion of the regional or minority languages in a given country also improve the
starting position for an intensified dialogue with the users of these languages in its
neighbouring countries. This is particularly true as regards transborder use of languages.
A widening Europe needs tolerance, acceptance and understanding for each other. The
protection and the promotion of the regional or minority languages in Europe have a
peacemaking function and reinforce democratic developments.
2. The Charter contains the criteria for regional or minority languages. It refers to the
languages traditionally spoken in a Contracting State. In Germany, a regional language
within the meaning of the Charter is Low German. Protected minority languages are the
languages of national minorities and of other ethnic groups traditionally resident in
Germany, who in the FRG come under the Council of Europe Framework Convention
for the Protection of National Minorities - Danes, the Sorbian people, Frisians in
Germany, and the German Sinti and Roma. These languages are Danish, Upper
(Lusatia) Sorbian and Lower (Lusatia) Sorbian [Wendish], North Frisian and Saterland
(East) Frisian, and the Romany language of the German Sinti and Roma.
The Federal Republic of Germany has laid down the Charter's scope of application in
Germany in Declarations made by the Federal Government to the Council of Europe in
order to ensure the admissibility of a territorially differentiating implementation of the
Charter in keeping with the federal structure of Germany (cf. Annex 2 - Federal Act to
implement the Charter, and Annex 3 - Declarations of 23 January 1998 and 26 January
1998). Since dialects and the languages spoken by incoming migrants are excluded from
the Charter's scope of application, the aforementioned languages cover all languages in
Germany which are eligible for the protection provided under the Charter.
The facilities provided by the Charter within its scope of application in Germany are
open to all speakers of the listed regional or minority languages.
3. Detailed information on the various languages:
3.1 The Danish language
Danish is traditionally spoken by the Danish minority in the Land of SchleswigHolstein to the south of the German-Danish border. The Danish minority, like the
German majority population, live in the German part of Schleswig in their traditional
settlement area, just as the German minority and the Danish majority population do on
the Danish side in North Slesvig - Sønderjylland. Germans and Danes have been living
together in this area for more than thousand years. Today's border between the two
countries was laid down in 1920 on the basis of the results of two plebiscites agreed
upon in the Treaty of Versailles.
The number of members of this ethnic group is estimated at some 50,000 persons who,
for the major part, live in the Schleswig region in the Kreise [county-type administrative
districts] of Nordfriesland and Schleswig-Flensburg, in the northern part of the Kreis of

5

Rendsburg-Eckernförde, and in the city of Flensburg. The percentage of the members of
the Danish minority in relation to the population of the various towns and communities
varies greatly, and ranges from local communities where only a number of families of
the minority live, to about 20 per cent in the town of Flensburg and some smaller
places.
All members of the Danish minority understand Danish, and most of them speak it. In
addition, all of them have a good command of German. In rural areas, parts of the
Danish minority – and of the majority population - speak the regional Low German
language; and in the immediate border area, the Danish minority as well as their
German fellow citizens also speak Sønderjysk, a South Jutish dialect of Danish.
The majority of the members of the Danish minority use the Danish language in the
private sphere. But account must also be taken of the situation in mixed- nationality
marriages where German usually prevails. Danish is spoken within the organizations of
the Danish minority. Constant use and promotion of the Danish language provide the
basis for all minority-related activities. Of particular importance for proficiency in the
Danish language are the Danish private schools, especially also for the children from
mixed-nationality marriages.
3.2 The Sorbian language (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian)
The Slavic people of the Sorbs, who have a history going back more than a millennium
and a culture of their own, has mostly lived within a setting of German statehood. In the
Middle Ages, the Sorbian language was spoken in a much more extended area than
today. Sorbian is part of the West Slavonic family of languages. From the various
dialects of colloquial Sorbian, two standard languages developed: Upper Sorbian [more
precisely: the Sorbian of Upper Lusatia], and Lower Sorbian [the Sorbian of Lower
Lusatia; also called Wendish]. Today's speech area of Sorbian covers Upper Lusatia in
the Northeast of the Free State of Saxony, and Lower Lusatia in the Southeast of the
Land of Brandenburg. The Sorbs living in Lower Lusatia are, until this day, also known
as Wends.
The number of persons considering themselves Sorbs is not known. The estimated
number is about 60,000 Sorbs, of whom two thirds live in Saxony, and one third in
Brandenburg. In some local communities in the Kreis of Kamenz, they account for up to
90 per cent of the population; in some other villages of the settlement area, the majority
of inhabitants are Sorbs. They make up about 10 per cent of the population of the
overall settlement area, while in the towns they account for less than 2 per cent.
Approximately 20,000 Sorbs still have a command of Sorbian in both its spoken and
written form; all Sorbs speak German as well.
Use of the Sorbian language in private depends, to a large extent, on the Sorbian people
themselves, especially on whether the language is passed on to their children. This
applies to a greater extent to the central settlements with a large share, or even the
majority, of Sorbs, than to families in larger places and towns where they constitute a
dispersed minority. In the case of the Sorbs, too, the existence of many mixednationality marriages has an influence on the language spoken within the family and on
the extent to which Sorbian is passed on to the children, and thus attendance of Sorbian
schools is of particular importance to these children.

6

Use of the Sorbian language in public is rendered difficult by the fact that the GermanSorbian settlement area is not generally bilingual but that, as a rule, only the Sorbs have
a command of both languages. Therefore, apart from a number of exceptions, greater
use is being made of German than of the Sorbian language in public and also in church.
3.3 The Frisian language (North Frisian and Saterland Frisian)
Frisian, as an autonomous and ancestral language, descended from the North Sea
Germanic division of the West Germanic subfamily, distinctly differs from Netherlandic
[Dutch and Flemish] and Low German and, in terms of historical linguistics, is closely
related to Old English. It has evolved in three subgroups: West Frisian, East Frisian, and
North Frisian. West Frisian is spoken in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands.
East Frisian is native to Ostfriesland in Lower Saxony. These two regions form the
hisrical [geographical] centre of the Frisians.
Already around the year 1500, the East Frisians replaced the Frisian language by Low
German as the language used for drafting legal documents. By 1800, for the major part,
and last on one of the North Sea Islands at the beginning of this century, they relinquished their ancestral Frisian language which, however, has continued to be used as
the language of everyday oral communication.
East Frisian has become extinct in the meantime; only in the Saterland in the Oldenburg
region, near the border with the Netherlands, about 2,000 persons still use Saterland
Frisian which forms part of the Old East Frisian subgroup of languages. About twice as
many people understand Saterland Frisian. Despite many Low German loan words,
Saterland Frisian has preserved its linguistic independence. The Saterland [East] Frisian
language originally had superimposed itself on the Westphalian Low German of the
first inhabitants of the Saterland. After East Friesland and the adjacent regions of the
Saterland had changed over to Low German, survival of Saterland Frisian was possible
only because the Saterland villages were located in a sandy river valley surrounded by
extensive fens which have, up to this century, provided a shield from contacts with the
outside world and from its influence that penetrates and moulds all spheres of life. The
use of Saterland Frisian by the Saterland Frisians is gradually increasing since schoolchildren are taking a greater interest in learning this language and children and the
grandparent generation have started to communicate in Saterland Frisian again.
After Frisians, about 1000 years ago, had settled also north of the central area, North
Frisian developed, which is related to Old Danish by a number of linguistic
characteristics. North Frisian consists of two groups of dialects with nine local varieties:
six of these [so-called Continental North Frisian] are spoken along the west coast of
Schleswig- Holstein (including the holms, or Halligen islands), and three of them [socalled Insular North Frisian] on the offshore islands of Sylt, Föhr, Amrum, and
Helgoland. Despite the linguistic diversity brought about by the subdivision into
dialects, the linguistic communality of North Frisian prevails. Of the total number of
nine North Frisian local idioms, three - which are spoken by less than 150 persons - are
acutely threatened by extinction. The other six local idioms are not only used orally but
also exist in written form. Their orthography for the major part is based on uniform
rules. The first book in the North Frisian language was published in 1809. Since then, a
large body of Frisian- language literature has been created, which covers several
hundreds of books and, in addition, several thousands of literary items in a variety of

7

publications. This ensures that the Frisian language also meets the requirements
expected of a modern means of communication.
The number of those who, on account of their origin and their sense of personal identity,
consider themselves North Frisians are estimated to number as many as 50,000 to
60,000 persons; this is one third of the population of this region. Of these, some 10,000
persons still speak North Frisian; another 20,000 persons understand this language.
The North Frisian language still is, to a major extent, the language spoken within the
family and the language for communication in public, especially among the Frisians
liing on the islands and holms (Halligen). This is less so on the continent. In mixedlanguage marriages, normally German prevails.
3.4 The Romany language of the German Sinti and Roma
The Romany spoken by the German Sinti and Roma is the language of those members
of this national minority who traditionally live in Germany. The Romany of the German
Sinti is spoken by an estimated number of up to 60,000 persons. This is an autonomous
language, deriving from Sanskrit, which is spoken by the Sinti in Western Europe,
especially in the German speech area, and which differs from the other Romany
languages used in Europe. In addition, the Romany of the German Roma is spoken by
an estimated number of up to 10,000 persons.
Historically, the language can be assigned to a larger number of small regions in
Germany where Sinti for centuries have been, or still are, traditionally resident.
However, its speech area cannot be narrowed down to just a few specific geographical
areas. The race policy of the despotic Nazi régime - entailing stigmatization and
discrimina tion, persecution and the genocide inflicted also on the Sinti and Roma - has,
moreover, destroyed the historical structures of this ethnic group in Germany and the
speech communities. After many survivors of the state-sponsored persecutory actions
during the Nazi period had, after the end of the war and after the Liberation, settled in
central conurbations, the speech community of their historical areas has changed.
Nowadays the German Sinti and Roma are integrated into society. In everyday life,
however, they are still subject to occasional private discrimination, due to the prejudices
on the part of some fellow citizens. This also is one of the reasons why the Romany
language is rarely used in public.
The majority of German Sinti and Roma nowadays live in the capitals of the "old
Länder" of Germany [the 11 federal States that belonged to the FRG within its
territorial boundaries up to German unification], including Berlin and its environs, and
in the conurbations of the Greater Hamburg area, the Rhine/Ruhr region with
Düsseldorf and Cologne at its centre, and the Rhine/Main and Rhine/Neckar
conurbations. In some cases, major numbers of German Sinti and Roma also live in
regions of geographically close, smaller towns. Thus, German Sinti and Roma
populations are to be found, for instance, in medium-sized and small towns of
Ostfriesland, Northern Hesse, the Palatinate, Baden and Bavaria. Thus, there is no
single speech area confined to any one Land for the Romany language traditionally
spoken in Germany. Rather, the language is spoken in most of the Länder of the Federal
Republic of Germany.
However, the high degree of dispersal and what nowadays often are only small numbers
of users of the Romany language in a narrowly delimited region must not result in any

8

impairment of the objective scope of protection if the causes of such dispersal have
been generated, or at least been significantly influenced, by earlier government action.
In this regard, there is a particular obligation incumbent on the state to help to achieve
that the problems which have arisen in respect of the existence of the language will be
reduced and that the scope for the development of the language and culture will be
expanded. To the extent possible at this time, this is taken account of in the measures,
both applied and envisaged, for protection and promotion.

3.5 The Low German language
Low Germa n (Niederdeutsch or Plattdeutsch) is the ancestral language of the German
North. As far as historical knowledge reaches back, people in Northern Germany have
always used this language; its form and function, however, have changed in the
meantime. Until this day, Low German has continued to exist as an independent
language in its own right, i.e. it is not a dialectal variation of High German. Until the
end of the late Middle Ages, the German North used only one other language besides
the scholars' Latin: the Low German language, which met all communication
requirements. Whatever had to be said or written in everyday dealings or in the fields of
trade, law, politics, religion and culture had to, and could, be expressed in the respective
variations of Low German. An expansive linguistic development went hand in hand
with the historical processes: while Low German, in its oldest period, had only been the
language of the Germanic tribal association of the Saxons - confined to a relatively
small settlement area - its speech area later on spread in territorial and functional terms.
In the 14th /15th Centuries, Low German was the prevailing linguistic medium for the
entire economic and cultural area of the Hanseatic League. The latter constituted - not
last in the form of, and through, the Low German language - one cultural area which,
while not of a uniform nature, formed a coherent entity. The era of Low German
unilingualism ended rather abruptly in the 16th Century. It was followed by a period continuing until this day - of the competing High German and Low German languages
existing side by side. The role of Low German was confined to being the generally
lower rated secondary language. From then on, this language was of a socially lesser
functional value than High German; it was rated lower and, consequently, its use
declined more and more.
The progressive decline of Low German took place in two stages. At the turn of the
16th /17th Centuries, Low German lost its written- language status to High German which
until then had been unfamiliar. After the chancelleries of princes and towns, the
educated middle classes, too, started to use High German for written communication.
While the majority of the North German population continued to use Low German for
oral communication until the latter part of the 18th Century, its losses in terms of
function and prestige had such lasting effects that, over time, one social class after the
other adopted High German. Finally the old language of the region survived, for the
major part, only as the everyday idiom of the "common folk", especially among the
rural population.
In the course of the evolution of modern society, the scope for the development and
survival of Low German was increasingly curtailed. The social processes of the 19th and
20th Centuries threatened its existence even as a fringe vernacular. Industrialization and
urbanization not only increasingly limited the scope for the use of Low German which

9

by now had been reduced to a local idiom; but ultimately they also resulted in the
wasting away and dissolution of the local language community where the regional
vernacular had its actual sphere of life. The bureaucratization of community life as well
as the democratization of education brought about by the general school and education
system promoted and definitively consolidated the transition of the majority of the
population to High German as the community language.
Despite these developments, a minority of committed citizens has, over the past 200
years, worked for the cultivation and promotion of the Low German language. Already
in the 17th and 18th Centuries, a number of citizens spoke up, who saw the decline of the
language as a severe loss of North German specificity and countered this decline with
literature written in Low German. Ever since, at the end of the Age of Enlightenment
and at the beginning of Romanticism, efforts were made to rediscover the 'people' with
their vernacular language and poetry and with their customs and ways of life, the sense
of an increasing loss of identity has given rise to the notion that Low German, as the
ancestral vernacular of the North, was of particular value in, and for, society.
Nevertheless, the Low German language and the culture defined and shaped by it have
had, until this day, only a fringe status in public life, in cultural life and in education. So
far, therefore, preservation of the indigenous regional language has been achieved
primarily by private initiatives. The achievements of such initiatives in terms of
cultivating and fostering the language and culture have been significant:
- They have recreated an independent Low German literature - with continuity,
quantity, quality, and subtlety and precision as its prominent features.
- They have established Low German in other spheres of cultural life as well: on the
stage, in church and in all modern media so that an autonomous Low German
cultural life has come into existence again.
- They have to this end created an institutional infrastructure of clubs, societies and
associatio ns, which in part also engage in supraregional work, of theatres and
publishing houses, and of writers' unions, teachers' and clergymen's associations,
together with publication organs.
The success of these activities is also due, for a major part, to the increasing assistance,
including funding, provided by the Länder, local governments and other institutions.
Nowadays Low German is traditionally spoken in eight Länder of the Federal Republic
of Germany. The Low German language area covers the entire terrority of Bremen,
Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein,
but only parts of Brandenburg, North Rhine/Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt. In the
various regions of this language area, local or regional variations of Low German,
which differ to a greater or lesser degree, are spoken - but generally as a secondary
language, with the High German standard language taking precedence, and usually only
for private purposes. The extent to which Low German idioms are used varies from one
region to another. Thus, Low German has, for a long time, been incomparably more
alive in the coastal regions than farther inland.
The number of people in Northern Germany who have a command of, and are still
using, any of the variations of Low German is not known. According to the only
informative study available, a representative survey of 1984, which only covers the Low
German region in the "old" Länder ["West Germany"] of the Federal Republic of
Germany,

10

-

an average of 56 % of the respondents said that they could speak Low German
(very well, well, or a little),
while 43 % stated that they could not speak it at all;
89 % of the respondents said that they were at least able to understand Low
German,
while only 11 % stated that they could not understand it.

For the three "new" Länder [i.e. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg and
Saxony-Anhalt] where Low German is spoken, no directly comparable data are
available; but the language situation in those Länder is assumed to be quite similar. On
this basis, the overall number of those who claim to have a more or less good
knowledge of the Low German language is estimated to amount to some eight million
individuals.
Notwithstanding the significant private commitment of those working in a large number
of clubs and associations, amateur theatre groups, writers' associations and circles of
poets, and despite considerable governmental promotional measures, the number of
speakers of Low German continues to dwindle, mainly for the reason that this language,
on account of the little esteem in which it is held and because of its lack of practical
functional value, is no longer passed on by the respective older generation to the
younger people.
4. The Bund [Federation; Federal Government/Administration] and the Länder have
established special bodies where regular exchanges take place between the political
level, public administration and the various language groups. As a rule, the language
groups - with the exception of the representatives of the Low German language - also
represent a national minority or ethnic group within the meaning of the Council of
Europe Frame work Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. In this
respect, discus sions within these bodies cover, in addition to the languages, all minorityrelevant concerns of these groups. Also, public administration has established functions
which are constantly in touch with the minorities and have direct responsibility for the
protection and promotion of the groups protected under the Framework Convention.
The creation of this infrastructure had to take account of the various needs of the
groups, and of the existing scope for government action. In addition, there are various
organizations dealing with the preservation and promotion of the protected languages.
4.1 Government agencies, other public authorities, and Commissioners
At the Federal level, the Federal Ministry of the Interior has the primary responsibility
for matters of minority-related law and for giving effect, at the national level, both to
the protection of national minorities and to the provisions of the Charter. As regards
human rights aspects of the protection of minorities, responsibility also lies with the
Federal Ministry of Justice. In the Länder, general responsibility for matters concerning
national minorities is vested in the respective State Chancellery or one of the Ministries
(usually the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and/or of Education, or the Ministry of
Scientific Affairs).
According to their specific portfolios, also other Ministries, or institutions at the same
level, deal with various aspects of the protection of minorities (usually in connection
with specific promotion tasks). At the federal level, this is the Federal Commissioner
for Cultural Affairs and the Media. In the Länder, there are, in instances, several

11

different Ministries with responsibility in this field since, under the federal system of
Germany, material support for the work of minority organizations mostly is a
respons ibility of the Länder.
In Brandenburg Land the Ministry for Science, Research and Cultural Affairs has a
Section for Sorbian (Wendish) Matters, while the Free State of Saxony has established a
Section for Sorbian Matters at its Ministry of Scientific Affairs and Arts. In SchleswigHolstein, the head of a section of the State Chancellery is responsible for minority
matters. In other Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany, these tasks are performed
by units of various supreme Land authorities. The interests of the Sorbian and
German/Sorbian schools in the Sorbian settlement area in the Free State of Saxony are
dealt with by a Commissioned Inspector of Schools of the Bautzen Regional Schools
Office.
In order to provide a direct point of contact to the minorities in Schleswig-Holstein, the
post of the Border Region Commissioner, who reports to the Minister-President, was
established in 1988. As of April 2000, the post is called the Minister-President's Commissioner for Minorities. Inter alia, the Commissioner [at present a woman] advises the
Minister-President on matters which concern the Danish minority in the Schleswig
region of this Land and the Frisians and German Sinti and Roma who live in SchleswigHolstein. The Commissioner for Minorities monitors the cultural, social and economic
developments in the border region in terms of their implications for the minorities and
reviews the development and implementation of the legislation on minorities and ethnic
groups at the international level. At the same time, she performs the func tion of a
Commissioner for Low German.
Kreise [county-type administrative districts] with larger shares of national minorities
and ethnic groups, and local authorities in the settlement areas of the latter have, like
other public-law corporations (e.g. Ostfriesische Landschaft), also established offices
for minorities. In Brandenburg, the kreisfreie Stadt [non-district municipality] of
Cottbus, and Spree-Neisse Landkreis [(rural) administrative district] have designated
full-time Commissioners for Sorbian Matters. In the Landkreise of OberspreewaldLausitz [Lusatia] and Dahme-Spreewald, honorary commissioners have been
designated. The Amt [local authority union] of Jänschwalde has designated an honorary
Sorbian Affairs Commissioner, and the Amt of Burg has a similar designation in
preparation.
For election of the Commissioners, the Sorbian associations had the right of nomination
in Cottbus and in the Ämter of Jänschwalde and Burg. In Spree-Neisse Landkreis,
opinions of the Sorbian associations were taken into consideration. In OberspreewaldLausitz Landkreis, the associations were not involved in the selection process but
agreed to the selection and since then have pursued constructive co-operation. In the
Landkreis of Dahme-Spreewald, the Sorbian associations exercised no right of
nomination.
In the Free State of Saxony, Bautzen Landkreis and the kreisfreie Stadt of Hoyerswerda
have Sorbian Affairs Commissioners. In Niederschlesischer Oberlausitzkreis [Lower
Silesian Kreis of Upper Lusatia], this function is performed by the office of the Landrat
[chief executive official of a Landkreis]. Kamenz Landkreis has laid down the rule that
a senior position in the administration is to be filled with a member of the Sorbian

12

people. At present, this is the post of the Head of the Department for Youth and Social
Affairs.
The tasks of the Sorbian Rights Commissioners include, for instance, preparations for
decisions of the mayor, departmental heads and town councils; co-ordination and cooperation with the local agencies and departments with regard to all Sorbian matters;
monitoring and supporting the public agencies in respect of the enforcement of the
rights of the Sorbian people, as guaranteed by the Land Constitution; introduction of
draft bills affecting the interests of the Sorbian population; and co-operation with Sorbian institutions.
The tasks of these public authorities include the protection of national minorities at the
federal and Land levels, including responsibility for legislative proposals, for the
implementation of minority-related law, including the pertinent international- law instruments, for promoting the work of national minorities and ethnic groups and, at the lo cal
government level, for on-the-spot assistance/counselling and direct support.
The activities of public authorities relate to the minorities living in the respective Land
or region, and at the federal level, to the Danish minority, the Sorbian people, the
Frisians in Germany, and the German Sinti and Roma.

by the Federal Minister of the Interior. The Committee is to ensure contacts of the
Danish ethnic group with the Federal Government and the Bundestag. It has the
task to discuss all important issues of the Federal Government's domestic policy
that concern or affect the Danish minority.
Foundation for the Sorbian People (Za³ožba za serbski lud): the members of the
board of trustees (Foundation Board) are representatives of the Sorbian people, of
the Bund [Federal Government], of the Free State of Saxony, and of Brandenburg
Land, and local government representatives; membership of the Parliamentary
Consultative Council includes Members of the German Bundestag, of the Saxon

13

-

Landtag and of the Brandenburg Landtag. The aim of the Foundation is the
promotion, both in terms of ideology [moral support] and funding, of activities
designed to preserve the Sorbian identity and language, Sorbian institutions and
Sorbian culture (the Director of the Foundation is a member of the Sorbian people).
Cf. the comments under no. 4.3.2 below [p. 14] for further details.
So far, no similar bodies have been established at the federal level to attend to
matters concerning the Frisians or the German Sinti and Roma. However, leading
personalities from the spheres of politics, science and industry in Germany are
represented on the Board of Curators of the Documentation and Cultural Centre of
German Sinti and Roma.

4. With regard to the various languages (Land bodies and organizations)
4.3.1

The Danish language

The chief organization of the Danish minority for cultural work and thus, in particular,
for the cultivation of the Danish language is Sydlesvigsk Forening (SSF, "Südschleswigscher Verein" - South Schleswig Association), with the Dansk Generalsekretariat in
Flensburg and a membership of 16,000; another 27 associations pursuing a wide variety
of activities are affiliated to the SSV.
Sydlesvigsk Forening is committed to the promotion of "Danish work in South
Schleswig", of the Danish language and of Danish folklore. In addition, the Association
maintains lively contacts with Denmark and the other Nordic countries, and its aim is
the keeping alive of the Danish culture and the Danish way of life. It organizes Danish
theatrical performances and concerts, maintains buildings as meeting places and
assembly rooms, a museum, a school hostel in the country [outdoor pursuit centre] as
well as residences for the elderly and operates senior citizens' clubs with a wide range of
recreational facilities and activities in the Danish language.
The programme of cultural events throughout the region also includes lectures, movies,
slide lectures, discussions and social gatherings. The yearly meeting of the Danish
minority, with large open-air gatherings in various places of the settlement area and
with parades with musical accompaniment, has for some time already developed into a
large public festival. The minority and the majority have opened up towards each other
and share experiences and activities.
The Danish minority also operates the historical museum of Danevirkegården near [the
town of] Schleswig, and an adult education centre in Jarplund.
Sydslesvigs danske Ungdomsforeniger, SdU (Danish Youth Association for Southern
Schleswig), organizes a wide range of youth work activities. It supports recreational
centres and sports facilities. Its affiliated bodies include, inter alia, the Danish- language
amateur theatre "Det lille Teater" in Flensburg. Associations of a very different
structure co-operate within the Youth Association. Besides sports clubs, these include
freely organized groups and church youth groups as well as the Danish Boy Scouts
Corps in South Schleswig. For the various fields of interests, there are numerous
recreational activities offered also outside group-based activities.
In addition, the Danish minority has a library system of its own, i.e. the Dansk
Centralbibliotek for Sydslesvig, or Dänische Zentralbibliothek für Südschleswig (Danish

14

Central Library for South Schleswig), which is the local main library for adults and
children and also comprises two mobile libraries, a bibliographic section and a selection
of audiovisual media. The Danish Central Library has two main branches and many
sub-branches in schools and nursery schools. It also comprises a research section and
archives.
Of particular importance to the Danish minority, and for the preservation of their
language, is their fully developed system of private schools. The providing body for
activities related to schools and nursery schools is Dansk Skoleforening for Sydslesvig,
or Dänischer Schulverein für Südschleswig [Danish Schools Association for South
Schleswig], with some 8,000 members. At present, it operates 58 nursery schools and
day-nurseries and 49 schools. These are are primary schools and secondary modern
schools - including remedial classes, four Realschulen [secondary technical schools],
one Gymnasium [grammar school] in Flensburg, and one comprehensive school.
The Danish minority finance their work with their own resources, with donations from
private individuals and foundations and, for a significant part, with allocations from the
budgets of the Schleswig- Holstein Land Government and of German local governments
in the settlement area. Also, the minority receive substantial funds for their work from
the Kingdom of Denmark and from the Danish Border Association. These funds make it
possible for the cultural work of the Danish minority to be carried out on an extensive
scale.
4.3.2. The Sorbian language
The Saxon Landtag elects a Council for Sorbian Affairs [Rada za serbske naležnosæe],
and the Landtag of Brandenburg a Council for Sorbian (Wendish) Affairs [Rada za
serbske nastup nosæi]. Each of these Councils has five members who, in Brandenburg
Land, must be members of the Sorbian people. In Brandenburg, Council members are
nominated by the Sorbian associations, and in the Free State of Saxony by Sorbian
associations and the German/Sorbian communities. The Council deals with all
parliamentarian matters of importance to the Sorbian people, including legislative
proposals, and submits comments/opinions from the Sorbian point of view.
In addition, the Sorbs have founded a large number of associations with widely varying
objectives. The umbrella organization of the Sorbian associations is Domowina –
Zwjazk Luziskich Serbow, or Bund Lausitzer Sorben [Federation of Lusatian Sorbs], to
which 14 organizations of the Sorbs, with more than 6,000 members, are affiliated.
These include the Sorbian Scientific Society/Macica Serbska and, for school and
cultural matters, Sorbischer Schulverein [Sorbian Schools Association], Bund der
sorbischen Studierenden [Union of Sorbian Students], Sorbischer Künstlerbund
[Zwjazk serbskich Wum³cow - Sorbian Artists' Union] and Verband sorbischer
Gesangvereine [Union of Sorbian Choral Societies]. In the field of youth work,
particular mention is to be made of the Sorbian youth organization Pawk. In addition,
there are many other associations and support/promoting associations which, partly also
from locations abroad, are committed and devoted to the cultivation and promotion of
the Sorbian history, la nguage and culture.
The ancestral settlement area of the Sorbs is in the Länder of Saxony and Brandenburg.
The two Länder have, mutually and with the Bund, agreed a common promotion policy.
This policy has been embodied in the Foundation for the Sorbian People (cf. para. 4.2

15

above [p. 12]). It was established in 1991 as an unincorporated foundation of the Free
State of Saxony, with the Bund and the Länder of Brandenbur g and Saxony as the
providing bodies. This unincorporated foundation has always been understood by the
interested parties as an interim solution. The aim was the establishment of a le gally
autonomous foundation which would enable the Sorbian people to organize its interests
and concerns in a largely autonomous way. After the structures required to this end had
been developed in the meantime, the [incorporated] foundation was established with the
conclusion of a State Treaty signed on 28 August 1998 in Schleife/ Saxony. The Treaty
was ratified on December 18, 1998, and entered into force on January 1, 1999.
The institutors of the Foundation, and Contracting Parties to the State Treaty, are the
Land of Brandenburg and the Free State of Saxony. The Federal Government (Bund),
on the basis of the Agreement on the Common Funding of the Foundation, provides
funding and appoints representatives to the Foundation's bodies. The principal tasks of
the Foundation are, in particular:
- promotion of institutions preserving the culture, arts and homeland of the Sorbs;
- promotion of, and participation in, projects concerning the documentation,
publication and presentation of Sorbian art and culture;
- promoting the preservation and further development of the Sorbian language and
cultural identity, also in Sorbian educational and scientific/scholarly facilities and in
such institutions as serve these objectives;
- promoting the preservation of the Sorbian identity among the general public, in
professional life and in the community life of the Sorbian and non-Sorbian
populations;
- promotion of projects aimed at furthering international understanding and cooperation with other ethnic groups and national minorities in Europe, and promotion
of the historically evolved relations of Sorbs with their Slav neighbours with a view
to forging a link between Germany and Eastern Europe; and
- participation in the design of governmental and other programmes affecting Sorbian
interests.
The main parameters of the Foundation's activities and its annual budget are decided by
the Foundation Board [board of trustees]. The Board is composed of 15 members, of
whom six are representatives of the Sorbian people. The Foundation's Parliamentary
Consultative Council supports and advises the board of trustees. The Consultative
Council has an extensive right of access to information. It is composed of two members
each of the German Bundestag and of the Saxon and the Brandenburg Landtage.
The Foundation is domiciled in the city of Bautzen, and has regional offices in Cottbus
and Schleife [both in Saxony], and in Hoyerswerda, Crostwitz and Bautzen [in
Brandenburg]. The Foundation's affairs are managed by the Director. The Foundation
has an administrative staff of currently 26 employees. The Foundation's administration
also comprises Sorbische Kulturinformation (Sorbian Cultural Information) in Bautzen
and the Sorbian Cultural Information Office [Serbska kulturna informacija] "Lodka" in
Cottbus.
For fulfilment of the Foundation's objectives, the Foundation receives annual grants
from the Bund, the Free State of Saxony and Brandenburg Land. After federal grants
had to be cut also in this field of activities on account of a general austerity programme
of the Federal Government, the Bund will in future provide a little less than half of the

16

Foundation's funds while the Free State of Saxony and Brandburg Land will provide a
good third and a bit over one sixth, respectively.
The following institutions are subsidized with endowment funds:
- Sorbisches National-Ensemble GmbH [Sorbian National Ensemble], Bautzen;
- Domowina - Bund Lausitzer Sorben e.V. [Zwajsk £uŸiskich Serbow z.t. Federation of Lusatian Sorbs, reg'd], as the umbrella organization of Sorbian
organizations;
- Domowina-Verlag GmbH [Domowina Publishing House], Bautzen;
- Sorbisches Museum Bautzen [Serbski Muzej Budyšin - Sorbian Museum in
Bautzen];
- Wendisches Museum Cottbus [Dolnoserbski muzej Choœebuz - Sorbian/Wendish
Museum in Cottbus];
- Sorbischer Schulverein [Sorbian Schools Association, reg'd];
- Sorbisches Institut e.V. [Sorbian Institute, registered association], Bautzen, as a
scholarly institution;
- Schule für niedersorbische Sprache und Kultur [School for the Low
Sorbian/Wendish Language and Culture] in Cottbus.
4.3.3

The Frisian language

The largest association of the Frisian ethnic group is Nordfriesischer Verein [North
Frisian Association] which was founded in 1902. It has about 4,700 members and more
than 25 local associations. A smaller group of North Frisians regard the Frisians as a
separate ethnic entity. They are organized in the Foriining for nationale Friiske, or
Verein nationaler Friesen [Association of National Frisians], which has some 625
members and politically works together with the Danish minority. Both associations are
dedicated to the preservation of the language, culture and landscape of Nordfriesland.
The providing body of Nordfriisk Instituut [North Frisian Institute] in Bredstedt is the
Verein "Nordfriesisches Institut" [Association for the North Frisian Institute].
The umbrella organization of the Frisians is Interfrasche Rädj [Interfriesischer Rat Inter-Frisian Council] which comprises three Frisian Councils: Section North (in the
Land of Schleswig-Holstein), Section East (in the Land of Lower Saxony), and Section
West (in the Netherlands). Membership of the Section North of the Frisian Council
includes representatives of the North Frisian Assocation and of the National Frisians,
and one representative of the North Frisian Institute. The Section East brings together
the associations of East Frisians and Saterland Frisians. The main associations in the
East Frisian area are: Ostfriesische Landschaft (a public- law corporation) and
Friesischer Klootschiesserverband [Frisian Curling Association]. The interests of the
Saterland Frisians within this Section are represented by Seelter Buund, an association
which, in particular, is dedicated to the cultivation of the Saterland Frisian culture and
language.
In addition, there are, throughout the entire East Frisian area, many local clubs
dedicated to the cultivation and preservation of Frisian customs and folklore.
The Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein has a "body dealing with matters concerning the
Frisians in Schleswig-Holstein Land" which is chaired by the President of the Landtag.
Usually twice per year, this body discusses matters concerning the Frisian segment of
the population in the Land, with the aim of cultivating and fostering the Frisian

17

language and culture. Its members are representatives of the political parties of the
Landtag, the Bundestag MPs for Nordfriesland, representatives of the Land
Government and of the Frisian Council - Nordfriesland Section. North Frisians are also
represented on local councils. The meetings of some of these bodies are held also in the
Frisian language.
Since 1950, Kiel University has the Nordfriesische Wörterbuchstelle [North Frisian
Dictionary Institute], and since 1978, the professorial chair for Frisian philology.
Of great importance to the cultivation of the Frisian language, culture and history is the
Nordfriisk Instituut (Nordfriesisches Institut - North Frisian Institute) in Bredstedt, as a
central scholarly institution in Nordfriesland. In particular, its scholarly and journalistic
activities cover the areas of the languages, history, and study of the geography and
civilization of Nordfriesland. It has a specialized library and archives, and offers
seminars, courses, workshops and lectures. The Institute's providing body is the Verein
Nordfriesisches Institut, with a membership of about 850; the work of the Institute is
funded, in particular, by Land and local authorities.
Research work on the Frisian culture of Ostfriesland is undertaken sporadically by
various institutions, also including corporations under public law.
Research on the Saterland Frisian history, culture and language is of more recent date.
Saterland Frisian has not been handed down as a written language. A known work is a
collection of Saterland Frisian proverbs, dating from the year 1901. It was only after
World War II that the first spelling rules were laid down for this language. In 1980, a
"Saterland Frisian Dictionary" was published; a revised and significantly enlarged
edition is in preparation. Further publications are compilations of texts, such as
"Saterfriesisches Volksleben" and "Saterfriesische Stimmen". The Zentralstelle für die
sprachliche Landesforschung [Central Office for Linguistic Regional Research] of
Göttingen University, with the support of Saterland Gemeinde, carried out a poll among
10 per cent of the inhabitants of the Saterland region. The project is to provide findings
regarding the awareness of the members of this ethnic group in respect of their own
history and culture. The study of the Saterland Frisian language lies, in particular, in the
hands of a Germanist [scholar studying German/Germanic languages and literatures] of
Oldenburg University.
In Lower Saxony, a Commissioner for Saterland Frisian/Low German was appointed in
1997 to serve with the Government of Weser-Ems Bezirk [District].
4.3.4

The Romany language

To safeguard representation of their interests, members of the German Sinti and Roma
have formed associations and - in line with the federal structure of Germany - Land
Associations. The Central Council of German Sinti and Roma is the umbrella
organization of nine Land Associations of German Sinti and Roma and of a number of
regional or lo cal associations and institutions.
With the Bundestag Resolution of 26 June 1986, all parliamentary groups of the
German Bundestag have confirmed the need for the enhancement of the living
conditions of the German Sinti and Roma and for promotion of their integration into
society. Since 1991, the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and the

18

Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma have been supported by
publicly funded institutional promotion.
Priority tasks of the Central Council are: representation of the interests of this national
minority with regard to according them political equal status - this also includes, for
instance, legislative proposals and political initiatives for the protection against
radicalright violent offences and outrages, and the Holocaust Memorial; enforcement of
minority rights and of indemnification claims of Holocaust victims; commemoration of
the genocide victims; and supporting public prosecution of Nazi crimes at the national
and international levels. Other chief activities are co-operation with the Land
Associations of German Sinti and Roma and with international minority and human
rights organizations, and support for Sinti and Roma in other countries.
Priority activities of the Documentation and Cultural Centre are: documentation and
scholarly work regarding the history, culture and present situation of this national
minority; cultural work, education and further education; social work and counselling;
and public information/education with the aim of integrating the German Sinti and
Roma into society while preserving their cultural identity. The Centre publishes a series
of papers in several volumes, e.g. on subjects like "Sinti/Roma Story-Telling in the
Context of European Folk-Tale Traditions", "Portrayal of Gypsies in German-Language
Literature", or "Children and Adolescents as Victims of the Holocaust". In addition,
several comprehensive works have been published, such as the documentation entitled
"Sinti and Roma under the Third Reich - The Programme of Extermination Through
Labour". Also, the Documentation and Cultural Centre organizes cultural projects and,
in a large permanent exhibition, shows the history and the extent of the NationalSocialist genocide of 500,000 Roma and Sinti in Europe. A travelling exhibition on the
same subject will in future tour several German cities.
In 1989, substantial public funding provided for the purchase, interior and exterior
alteration of premises in Heidelberg for use by the aforementioned institutions. These
premises house the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, the Documentation and
Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma, and the Permanent Exhibition on the Genocide of Sinti and Roma during the Nazi Era.
Public funds are provided to the Central Council for five staff posts (mainly academic
positions), and to the Documentation and Cultural Centre for 19 posts. The budget of
the Central Council is fully funded by the Bund while for the budget of the
Documentation and Cultural Centre, 90 per cent of the funds are provided by the Bund
and the remainder by Baden-Wurttemberg Land.
The Lower Saxony Land Association of German Sinti, one Sinti and Roma association
in Hamburg and a number of smaller organizations of German Sinti, or of German Sinti
and Roma, or of German and foreign Roma are independent.
A number of organizations not affiliated to the Central Council, and elders of family
clans of German Sinti have recently formed the Sinti Allianz Deutschland e.V. [Sinti
Alliance Germany, reg'd]. As stated in its Rules, the aims of this Alliance are
representation of the interests of the clans, tribes and associations of German Gypsies
(Sinti), the preservation and promotion of Sinti culture, and the fostering of - interethnic
- understanding between German Gypsies (Sinti) and the German majority population.

19

Another aim is to preserve and cultivate the millennia-old Indo-European culture and
language of the Sinti.
There are no specific governmental bodies and institutions dealing with the protection
and promotion of the Romany language. This is in line with the wishes of the majority
of this language group. Related to this is the objection raised by the Central Council of
German Sinti and Roma and other associations of German Sinti to the introduction of
the Romany language in publicly maintained schools or to making it the subject of
scholarly research. This is based on the experience made with Nazi language researchers. Therefore, the Central Council and other associations take the view that, also out of
regard for the experience undergone by the survivors of the genocide, Romany should
neither be taught by non-Gypsies nor be learnt within the public educational system. A
different position is taken by Roma associations which come out in favour of the
inclusion of Romany in school education and wish to support measures, like those taken
in European neighbouring countries, for the development of a written form of this
language. Thus, going by those German Sinti and Roma as are represented by their
relevant organizations, the vast majority of German Sinti and Roma are against
inclusion of their Romany language in the State-run educatio n system, and emphasize
their right to the option that it should be exclusively within the family and family clans
that their language is cultivated and passed on to future generations.
4.3.5

The Low German language

The focused promotion of Low German ha s, for a number of years, been regularly
discussed or co-ordinated within political bodies.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, a Low German Consultative Council, chaired by
the Minister for Education, Scientific and Cultural Affairs, co-ordinates all pertinent
activities.
The Schleswig- Holstein Landtag in 1992 set up the Consultative Council for Low
German. This Council deals with all matters concerning the cultivation of the Low
German language. Also in 1992, the office of the Minister-President's Commissioner for
Low German was established. The Commissioner is the contact person for Low German
clubs, associations and organizations.
In early 1999, a Working Group on the Implementation of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages was set up in Lower Saxony. Representatives of
various Ministries, of Niedersächsischer Heimatbund [Lower Saxony Union for Local
and Regional Traditions] and of the various parliamentary groups of the Landtag work
together within this Group.
At present, the Universities of Bielefeld, Flensburg, Greifswald, Göttingen, Hamburg,
Kiel, Münster, Magdeburg and Rostock have firmly established research and teaching
capabilities
(professorial
chairs,
departments,
lectureships)
for
various
college/university degrees. In addition, courses of study are offered, for instance, by the
Universities of Bremen, Paderborn, Potsdam, Oldenburg and Osnabrück; also, a number
of workshops for regional Low German dictionaries have been established. The scholars
working in this field have, for more than 100 years, been organized in the Verein für
niederdeutsche Sprachforschung [Association for Low German Linguistic Research].

20

Also, the existing clubs dedicated to the preservation of local/regional traditions and the
unions of such clubs traditionally perform an important share of the tasks. The
following were founded in more recent times for specific tasks; their establishment has
been the wish of community action groups and government agencies alike, and they are
financed fully or to a large extent with government funds:
- the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache [Institute for the Low German Language] in
Bremen (cf. the detailed description in the preliminary remarks to Article 12, para. 1
(a) [p. 194 below: Low German]);
- the Regionalsprachliche Fachstelle [Regional Language Specialist Centre] of [the
public- law corporation] Ostfriesische Landschaft in Aurich, Lower Saxony; and the
Ostfälisches Institut [Eastphalian Institute] in Ummendorf, funded by the regional
local authority Deuregio Ostfalen [Deuregio Eastphalia] working across Land
borders - a co-operation project of formerly five, now three Kreise in Lower Saxony
and Saxony-Anhalt;
- the Niederdeutsch-Zentren [Low German Centres] for the Land regions Schleswig
(in Leck) and Holstein (in Ratzeburg), both established by Schleswig-Holstein
Land; and in Bremen, re-assignment of two half positions of teachers attending to
Low German courses offered at schools;
- the Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Institute for Folk Culture of
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania] in Rostock, which formerly was governmentsponsored, but now its providing body is the Kulturbund.
5. Within the Federal Government, the Federal Ministry of the Interior has the overall
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the [European] Charter [for Regional
or Minority Languages]. To support that implementation, measures have been, and
continue to be, taken to elucidate the contents of this international- law instrument, and
its implications in practice, by means of lectures and other inputs at conferences and
seminars, in which both government officials responsible for the protection of languages
and representatives of the language groups concerned participated, or participate. One
of the permanent tasks is implementation counselling for the various Länder and
government departments, especially also through the sharing of practical experience
gained in other Länder and foreign countries, study of the requirements of the minorities
concerned, and advice provided to Länder and to language groups.
In June 1999, the first Implementation Conference regarding the Charter took place,
which brought together representatives of the Federal Ministries responsible for the
protection of languages, similar representatives of the Länder of the Federal Republic of
Germany, representatives of the language groups protected under the Charter, and
scholars. The subject was the implementation status of the Charter in Germany, the
deficits still encountered in this respect, and development of the German State Report.
Such conferences are to be held at regular intervals. Also, the Council of Europe
instruments on the protection of minorities (Framework Convention and Charter) and
their implementation status regularly are the subject of discussions of bodies in which
Parliamentarians, government representatives and representatives of the minorities/
language groups co-operate.
Before its final endorsement at the national level, the State Report was sent to the
central organizations of the groups concerned for their comments. Their 'feedback'
comments are, to a large extent, reflected in the present State Report. After its submission to the Secretariat of the Council of Europe, this State Report will be published
in Germany.

21

6. Following its entry into force, the Charter has continued to be the subject of intensive
media reporting both at the supraregional level and in the central settlement areas of the
language groups concerned. On the occasion of the ratification of the Charter, during a
ceremony with representatives of the groups concerned, the Federal Ministry of the
Interior provided information on the Charter. With reference to the Act ratifying the
Charter, a detailed Memorandum to the Charter, providing information on the
background and content of the Charter, was developed and has been widely
disseminated. The text of the Charter has been published, inter alia, in the collection of
texts compiled by the Federal Centre for Political Education (BpB) and entitled
"Human Rights - Documentation and Declaration". The Länder, too, have drawn
attention to this international- law instrument in various publications (brochures, press
releases, Minority Report, etc.). The language groups, in particular, have informed their
members in many and various ways.
Of the measures taken by the various Länder for the dissemination of information on the
Charter, the following are to be mentioned with regard to Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania and Schleswig-Holstein:
- The members of the Niederdeutsch-Beirat Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Low
German Consultative Council, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania] have, in a number
of meetings, dealt with the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages. This subject will continue to be part of the activities of the
Niederdeutsch-Beirat.
- The Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions, reg'd] has published an
information leaflet on the implementation on the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages and on September 03 - 12, 1999, with the support of the
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Ministry for Education, Scientific and Cultural
Affairs, organized Land-wide Plattdeutsch-Tage [Low German Workshops].
- At a joint meeting in Schwerin on 26 August 1999, the Low German Consultative
Councils of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and of Schleswig-Holstein dealt with
the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
- In the autumn of 1999, the Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural
Affairs of the North German Länder was held in Schwerin. One of the agenda items
was the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages with regard to the Low German language.
- After the entry into force of the Charter, a specialist conference was held, at the
invitation of the President of the Schleswig- Holstein Landtag, with representatives
of the language groups at the Niederdeutsch Zentrum [Low German Centre] in [the
Schleswig town of] Leck.
- At about the time of the entry into force of the Charter, the so-called Charter Day
was held. On this occassion, the Charter was handed over by representatives from
the Low German language region to local/municipal councils.
- In November 1999, the Schleswig-Holstein Land Government presented its
Minority Report (1996 - 2000). This also contains information on the development
and the importance of the Charter. The Report was published in brochure form and
has been widely disseminated.
- Funds provided by the Land of Schleswig- Holstein were used to subsidize an
information leaflet published by the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache [INS Institute for the Low German Language] in Bremen.

Part B
Protection of Regional or Minority Languages under Part II
(Article 7) of the Charter
In two Declarations of 23 January and 26 January 1998 and in an Additional Declaration (cf.
Annex 3), the Federal Republic of Germany has, in the context of ratification, defined the
scope of application of the Charter as regards the regional or minority languages spoken in
Germany.
The languages covered by the Charter are primarily "territorial languages", i.e. languages
which traditionally are used in a specific geographic area. The reason for this is that most of
the measures provided under the Charter call for the determination of a geographic scope of
application differing from the territory of the country as a whole. Therefore, in addition to
the obligations under Part II of the Charter, the Federal Republic of Germany has no tified
the Council of Europe of the specific provisions of Part III of the Charter, which are
complied with by Germany in respect of the regional or minority languages Danish, Upper
Sorbian and Lower Sorbian, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian, and Low German (in the
following Länder: Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg,
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig- Holstein). The separate
specification of these provisions for the territories of each individual Land is in keeping with
the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany and takes account of the situation
of each of these languages in the respective Land/Länder where they have their geographic
basis.
As regards the protection and promotion of the minority language Romany (on the entire
federal territory) and of the regional language Low German (in the Länder of Brandenburg,
North Rhine/Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt), the legislation in force in Germany and Germany's administrative practice meet the general objectives and principles laid down in Article 7 of the Charter and, at the same time, individual requirements under Part III of the
Charter. The pertinent details are discussed in the comments to Part III of the Charter [cf.
Part C below, p. 43]. Therefore, this description of implementation measures taken under
Part II is confined to the essential features and aspects.

Article 7
Objectives and Principles
(1)
In respect of regional or minority languages, within the territories in
which such languages are used and according to the situation of each
language, the Parties shall base their policies, legislation and practice on
the following objectives and principles:

re: para. 1, sub-para. A
(a)

the recognition of the regional or minority languages as an
expression of cultural wealth;

Compliance by the German system of law with this provision is documented by the notification of the two Declarations on the scope of application of the Charter [cf. Annex 3
below] and by the extensive measures taken for its implementation.

23

re: para. 1, sub-para. b
(b)

the respect for the geographical area of each regional or minority
language in order to ensure that existing or new administrative
divisions do not constitute an obstacle to the promotion of the
regional or minority language in question;

1. In Germany, there are, on principle, no governmental or other measures which would
alter the proportions of the population in the settlement areas of the language groups
concerned. Ho wever, changes in the population figures of the various communities and
regions are entailed by the general mobility which, in particular, is also due to the
economic structure in some regions, by out- migration to conurbations or by the arrival
of new residents, or by the incoming migration of "late repatriates" (i.e. persons who
formerly belonged to German minorities, especially in States of the former Soviet
Union, and who resettled in Germany). These movements to a certain extent also affect
the proportions of the various language groups as a percentage of the respective local
population. This, however, neither is directed against the exercise of the rights of these
groups nor does it have an influence on the participation of their members in decisionmaking on matters affecting them.
The changes regarding the borders and areas of local- government administrative
districts entailed by the general territorial reorganization of local government in the Free
State of Saxony and in Brandenburg Land, have, however, also reduced the Sorbian
inhabitants' portion of the population in some Kreise and Gemeinden. In the context of
the territorial reorganization, it was not possible to take account of all of the concerns
and interests of the affected communities, [local-authority] associations and Sorbian
minority organizations. In some cases, the local self-administration units have
designated Commissioners.
2. In connection with alterations of the population structure, one of the subjects of public
discussion was the legally regulated dissolution of Horno Gemeinde and, as a corollary,
the resettlement of the German-Sorbian population of this community in Lower Lusatia
in Brandenburg, which had to yield its place to brown coal mining.
Lignite mining and the energy industry relying on it are important key industries of
Brandenburg, which substantially contribute to the economic development of this Land.
In Brandenburg Land there are no economically exploitable lignite beds or deposits
outside built- up areas and thus outside settlements. Consequently, decisions regarding
brown coal open-cast mining require prior discussion of the problem of any resettle ment
entailed by mining.
The main lignite coal mines in Brandenburg are in Lower Lusatia. This is the traditional
settlement area of the Sorbian (Wendish) people. Due to the one-sided focus of the
power-supply industry of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] on the use of
brown coal, many people, during that period, had to leave their home villages since
these were claimed for purposes of open-cast lignite mining. This also affected many
Sorbs. The inhabitants of these places were, without any regard for their ethnic origin
and identity, resettled - often even dispersed - in other places, mainly in the city of

24

Cottbus and its suburbs. In these places, it was rather difficult to preserve the traditional
identity. Society's pressure for assimilation set in, or was substantially increased.
As a deliberate departure from this policy, Brandenburg Land pursues the aim of
avoiding further losses of Sorbian (Wendish) identity. The legal bases for resettlement
in connection with brown coal open-cast mining are the Brandenburg Town and
Country Planning Act of 20 July 1995 and the Brandenburg Act on Lignite Mining
Policy of 7 July 1997.
The principle enshrined in Section 3, para. 2, no. 8, of the Brandenburg Town and
Country Planning Act - requiring that the concerns of the Sorbian (Wendish) population
in Lusatia and their history, language and culture be considered in all plans and
measures - is implemented in town and country planning without any restrictions. This
principle also was adopted in the Regional Policy Plan. This ensures, also in conformity
with the Act to regulate the substance of the Sorbs' (Wends') rights in the Land of
Brandenburg [SWG - Sorbs (Wends) Act], that the concerns of the Sorbian (Wendish)
population in Lusatia will have to be taken account of in all plans and measures.
In addition, the Brandenburg Act on Lignite Mining Policy contains a number of general
provisions on brown coal mining and, in particular, on the social sustainability of
resettlements that cannot be avoided. In this respect, however, resettlement is not a
measure that exclusively affects the affairs and interests of the Sorbian (Wendish)
minority but has the same impact on the majority population as well, for instance the
inhabitants of Kausche, a community outside the Sorbs' settlement area. But if such use
of a Sorbian or German-Sorbian settlement cannot be avoided, special account must be
taken of the requirements of minority protection, as defined in legal provisions.
Therefore, if a Sorbian or German-Sorbian settlement must be used for mining
purposes, the aim is to resettle the affected inhabitants, as a body, in the traditional
settlement area and thus to maintain the life environment in which the persons
concerned can preserve their folklore and ethnic traditions and can, to the greatest extent
possible, avoid the assimilation pressure exerted by an unfamiliar environment. In each
individual case, an attempt is made to find solutions in mutual agreement.
In order to ensure consideration of the Sorbs' (Wends') interests also in practice within
the framework of lignite-mining and rehabilitation/renewal planning, Section 1, para. 3,
no. 6, of the Ordinance on the Establishment of the Brown Coal Committee of Brandenburg Land of 5 April 1992 provides that one representative of Domowina
[Federation of Lusatian Sorbs, reg'd association], the umbrella organization of Sorbian
associations, is to be delegated, as a voting member, to the Brown Coal Committee of
Brandenburg Land and is to participate actively in the decisions of this Committee.
Moreover, the Sorbian (Wendish) associations/unions are involved in the development
of lignite- mining and rehabilitation/renewal plans. Also, the Sorbs (Wends) take part in
all decision-making by the institution responsible for regional planning. Representatives
of Domowina are advisory members of the Regional Assembly of the LusatiaSpreewald Regional Planning Association.
The resettlement issue became a matter of topical interest especially in connection with
open-cast mining in Jänschwalde. Continuation of these open pit mines requires use of
the area of Horno Gemeinde. Under the Act on Lignite Mining Policy and the relevant
Lignite-Mining Plan, German and Sorbian inhabitants - who object(ed) to relo cation were offered possibilities of being jointly resettled within the traditional Sorbian

25

settlement area. Under the relevant law, Hormo Gemeinde was dissolved and, under
local-government law, was incorporated in Jänschwalde Gemeinde on 27 September
1998; the inhabitants are expected to resettle in the period 2000 - 2002. The legally
prescribed hearing of the inhabitants on the prospective site of resettlement took place
in the meantime. The hearing showed that the majority of the Horno citizens preferred
the town of Forst (Lusatia) over Jänschwalde as a resettlement site. Forst is located
within the traditional settlement area of the Sorbs (Wends). The preparations for
resettlement in this town are underway.
The Act on Lignite Mining Policy, Article 2 of which regulates the dissolution of Horno
Gemeinde, was the subject of five legal proceedings before the Brandenburg Land
Constitutional Court. These were an avoidance petition [for judicial review of statutes
or administrative acts] submitted by a parliamentary group of the Brandenburg Landtag,
and constitutional complaints [complaints of unconstitutionality] filed by Domowina, as
the umbrella organization of Sorbian (Wendish) associations, by the Council for
Sorbian (Wendish) Affairs established at the Brandenburg Landtag, by Horno
Gemeinde, and by an inhabitant of Horno. In its decision of 18 June 1998, the Land
Constitutional Court, however, found that - in view of the special importance of lignite
mining for structural improvements, job security and energy supply - the legislator's
decision to dissolve Horno Gemeinde and to use its area for open-cast lignite mining is
constitutional - notwithstanding the importance attached by the Court to the State's aim
as stipulated in Article 25, para. 1, 1st sentence, of the Land Constitution, namely the
protection, preservation and cultivation of the Sorbs' (Wends') settlement area. The
Court's decision took special account of the supplementary provisions of this Act,
calling for a maximum of considerate treatment of the inhabitants of the community, in
particular the offer to provide for joint resettlement within the Sorbian settlement area.

re: para. 1 , sub-para. c
(c)

the need for resolute action to promote regional or minority
languages in order to safeguard them;

For all persons speaking a country's official language as their native language it is a
matter of course to learn their language, be taught in that language and to use it. For a
much smaller group within the nation's population, the requisites for the preservation of
an autonomous language can be ensured only by means of an appropriate infrastructure.
Therefore, government measures serving the cult ivation of regional or minority
languages are aimed at placing the speakers of the given language on an equal footing
with the majority population. Thus, such measures do not constitute a violation of the
principle of equality; rather, they comply with it by ruling out discrimination and
unequal treatment. The state may take adequate measures to promote the equa lity of
speakers of regional or minority languages with the speakers of the generally spoken
official language in those cases where such measures are necessary and appropriate.
3. In keeping with the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, responsibility
for the implementation of measures to promote and preserve the languages protected by
the Charter primarily lies with the Länder. The Constitutions of five Länder of the
Federal Republic of Germany contain provisions relating to national minorities and ethnic groups, or to national and ethnic minorities. In part, these provisions directly relate
also to the language/languages spoken by the latter. There is one constitutional

26

provision protecting the Low German language. Such constitutional provisions form the
basis for legislative measures or for administrative action taken for the benefit of these
languages.

27

3.1 Article 25 of the Constitution of the Land of Brandenburg paraphrases the rights of
the Sorbs (Wends) as follows:
"(1) The right of the Sorbian people to the protection, preservation and
fostering of their national identity and of their ancestral settlement area is
guaranteed. The Land, local go vernments and local authority associations
will promote the fulfilment of this right, especially the existence of the
Sorbian culture in its own right and effective political participation by the
Sorbian people.
(2) The Land will work towards ensuring the cultural autonomy of the
Sorbs across the Land borders.
(3) The Sorbs have the right to the preservation and promotion of the
Sorbian language and culture in public life and to having these imparted in
schools and child day-care centres.
(4) In the settlement area of the Sorbs, the Sorbian language shall be
included in the marking of public identification signs for buildings and
places. The Sorbian flag has the colours 'blue, red, white'.
(5) A law will lay down the details of the rights of the Sorbs. That law
shall ensure that Sorbian representatives will participate in matters of the
Sorbs, especially as regards legislation."
3.2 The Constitution of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, in its Article 16,
para. 2, refers to the Low German language:
"The Land shall protect and promote the cultivation of the Low German
language."
In the Constitution of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, it says in
Article 18:
"The existence, in its own right, of the culture of ethnic and national
minorities and of ethnic groups of citizens of German nationality is
afforded specific protection by the Land."
3.3 Article 5, para. 2, of the Constitution of the Free State of Saxony reads as follows:
"The Land guarantees and protects the right of national and ethnic
minorities of German nationality to the preservation of their identity and to
the cultivation of their languages, religion, culture and tradition."
Several Articles of the Constitution of the Free State of Saxony refer to the Sorbs:
Article 2, para. 4, says that:
"In addition to the colours and the coat of arms of the Land, the colours and
coat of arms of the Sorbs may be deployed, on an equal footing, in the

28

settlement area of the Sorbs, and the colours and coat of arms of Lower
Silesia in the Silesian region of the Land."
Article 5, para. 1, reads as follows:
"Citizens of German, Sorbian or other ethnic origin belong to the people of
the Free State of Saxony. The Land recognizes the lex patriae [right to live
in one's native country]."
Article 6 reads as follows:
"(1) The citizens of Sorbian ethnic origin living in the Land are a segment
of the state's population who enjoy equal rights. The Land guarantees and
protects the right to the preservation of their identity and to the cultivation
and development of their traditional language, culture and tradition,
especially by schools, preschool facilities and cultural instit utions.
(2) Within the framework of Land and local- government planning, account
shall be taken of the necessaries of life of the Sorbian people. The GermanSorbian character of the settlement area of the Sorbian ethnic group shall be
preserved.
(3) The co-operation, across Land borders, among Sorbs, especially in
Upper and Lower Lusatia, is in the interest of the Land ."
3.4 The Constitution of the Land of Saxony-Anhalt lays down that:
"The existence, in its own right, of the culture of ethnic minorities and their
political participation are afforded protection by the Land and local
governments." (Article 37, para. 1)
3.5 Article 5 of the Constitution of the Land of Schleswig-Holstein reads as follows:
"(1) Everybody is free to declare that he or she belongs to a national
minority; such declaration does not release the given individual from his or
her general civic duties.
(2) The existence, in its own right, of the culture of national minorities and
ethnic groups and their political participation are afforded protection by the
Land, local governments and local authority associations. The national
Danish minority and the Frisian ethnic group are entitled to protection and
promotion."
Article 9, para. 2, of the Constitution of the Land of Schleswig-Holstein reads as
follows:
"The Land shall protect and promote the cultivation of the Low German
language."
3.6 A further basis for the rights of the Danish minority is provided by the Bonn
Declaration of 29 March 1955, which was preceded by the Declaration of 26

29

September 1949 by the Land Government of Schleswig-Holstein (Kiel
Declaration).
With regard to the Sorbian people, a protocol note to Article 35 of the Treaty on the
Establishment of German Unity states the following:
"Regarding Article 35 of the Unification Treaty, the Federal Republic of
Germany and the German Democratic Republic declare the following:
1. Everybody is free to declare his or her affiliation with the Sorbian
ethnic community and with the Sorbian culture.
2. The preservation and further development of the Sorbian culture and of
Sorbian traditions are guaranteed.
3. Members of the Sorbian people and their organizations enjoy the
freedom to cultivate and preserve the Sorbian language in public life."
3.7 Section 8 of the Act to regulate the substance of the Sorbs' (Wends') rights in the
Land of Brandenburg [SWG] explicitly states that the Sorbian language, especially
Lower Sorbian, shall be protected and promoted. Provisions similar to these of
Brandenburg are to be found in Article 6, para. 1, of the Constitution of the Free
State of Saxony and in Section 2, para. 3, of the Saxon Sorbs Act [SächsSorbG].
3.8 On 10 September 1997, the Federal Republic of Germany ratified the Framework
Conve ntion for the Protection of National Minorities which for Germany entered
into force on 1 February 1998. The Framework Convention also comprises a
number of language-related provisions under international law. The constitutional
stipulations regarding the protection of the national minorities and of the other
ethnic groups traditionally resident in Germany, and the provisions under
international instruments and treaties are put into concrete terms by laws,
ordinances, statutes, and administrative action. Thus, federal legislation such as the
Federal Electoral Act, and a number of Land Acts contain provisions designed to
ensure scope for the participation of national minorities and for the promotion of
their identity and thus, in particular, of their language/s. The Land Acts which are
aimed also at the protection and promotion of languages refer to national minorities
who live, as a group, in their traditional settlement areas. There are no laws
referring directly to the Low German la nguage.
In Section I of the Declaration by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany on the Rights of the Danish Majority (Bonn Declaration) of 29 March
1955, it was made clear that the members of the Danish minority, like all German
nationals, enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of
Germany of 23 May 1949. These constitutional rights are listed under paras. 1 to 12
[of the Declaration]. The Bonn Declaration of 29 March 1955 had been preceded by
the Kiel Declaration by the Schleswig-Holstein Land Government on the Status of
the Danish Minority of 26 September 1949.
4. In addition to the legal protection existing already prior to the entry into force of the
Charter in Germany, mention is to be made of a large variety of governmental promotion measures relating directly to, or benefiting, the regional or minority languages. For
details, cf. the comments below in Part C of the Report regarding Part III of the Charter.

30

re: para. 1, sub-para. d
(d)

the facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of regional or
minority languages, in speech and writing, in public and private life;

The right of the members of national minorities to use their language in daily life is
protected by Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law, which guarantees the right to free
development of personality. This right is valid also in the context of the freedoms of
opinion, of the press and of reporting through audiovisual media, as guaranteed by Article 5,
para. 1, of the Basic Law. Accordingly, there are no restrictions in the Federal Republic of
Germany as regards the use of the minority language in private or public life.
However, as regards the citize ns' dealings with the public administrative machinery,
German is the official language under Section 23 of the [Federal] Administrative Procedure
Act. The Administrative Procedure Acts of the Länder also lay down German as the official
language. German also is the official language in court. In accordance with the obligations
notified for the various languages, a number of individual regulations have been laid down
for the regional and minority languages, under which a minority language may be used in
specified cases in one's relations with local and regional administrative authorities.
In addition to the freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law for the entire German territory, the
Land of Brandenburg, in Section 8 of its Act to regulate the substance of the Sorbs' (Wends')
rights in the Land of Brandenburg (SWG), has explicitly restated that use of the Sorbian
language shall be free. Under the Saxony Land Constitution and Section 8 of the Act on the
Sorbs' Rights in the Free State of Saxony (Saxon Sorbs Act), and a number of other laws and
ordinances, the Sorbs in the Free State of Saxony have the right to use their language for
spoken and written communication in public and in private life.
The use of the protected languages in public is generally accepted by the German
population. No reservations exist in this respect. Languages other than German are used to a
far greater extent by the large numbers of foreigners living in Germany; such use does not
meet with any problems within society, leaving some far-rightists out of consideration.
For details, cf. the comments below in Part C of the Report regarding the obligations specifically entered into.

re: para. 1, sub-para. e
(e)

the maintenance and development of links, in the fields covered by
this Charter, between groups using a regional or minority language
or other groups in the State employing a language used in identical
or similar form, as well as the establishment of cultural relations
with other groups in the State using different languages;

1. The right to maintain and develop contacts is one of the fundamental freedoms
guaranteed by the Basic Law and is protected under Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law
(general freedom of action; freedom to leave the country) and Article 11, para. 1, of the
Basic Law (freedom of movement within the federal territory; freedom to enter the
country).

31

2. The State does not interfere with these rights, but instead welcomes contacts among the
members of the language groups within the nation and in other countries. Often such
activities are included in governmental promotion schemes. An example are the contacts
of organizations of the Sorbian people with groups of Sorbs living abroad who are also
members of Domowina, the umbrella organization of the Sorbian organizations.
Another example is the State- funded, close co-operation of the Central Council of the
German Sinti and Roma with the Kulturverein Österreichischer Roma [Cultural
Association of Austrian Roma] in Vienna. Also, public funds are provided for the
cooperation of Frisians in Germany with Frisians in the Netherlands, who have a
common umbrella organization with headquarters in Germany. There is particularly
close co-operation of the Danish minority with many and various organizations in
Denmark, and intensive private and cultural contacts exist between members of the
Danish minority and the Kingdom of Denmark.
3. The members of the language groups are united in various organizations and actively
participate in the work of many non- governmental organizations. The organizations of
minorities and ethnic groups in Germany co-operate on a non-committal basis, and all
of them are members of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN), which is
an umbrella organization of national minorities and traditional (autochthonous) ethnic
groups in Europe, with headquarters in Flensburg, the home of the Danish minority.
FUEN is supported by Schleswig-Holstein Land and also by a number of regional
governments in other countries where national minorities have their settlement areas.
Like other Governments of Central and North European countries, the Federal
Government (of Germany) subsidizes individual FUEN projects. The youth associations
of minorities in Germany are members of the Youth of European Nationalities (YEN),
an umbrella organization, which receives Federal Government subsidies for individual
projects.
The language groups in Germany are also members of the European Bureau for Lesser
Used Languages (EBLUL) which is funded by the European Union. Its member
organizations are united in a Committee for the Federal Republic of Germany, the
activities of which are supported by the Federal Government.
The Federal Republic of Germany welcomes the fact that the language groups in
Germany co-operate and also jointly with other national minorities and groups represent
their interests at the international level. This helps with the development and practical
implementation of the policies regarding minorities in Europe, which take account of
the needs of those concerned. In Germany, FUEN and the German EBLUL Committee
also participate in the implementation of the European instruments relating to the
protection of minorities.

re: para. 1, sub-para. f
(f)

the provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and
study of regional or minority languages at all appropriate stages;

The freedom of the individual to learn a language of his/her choice, free of any outside
influence, especially without interference by public authorities, is generally protected by
Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law.

32

In Germany, implementation of the obligations [under the Charter] is incumbent on the
Länder. The legal situation and legal practice as well as the governmental promotion
measures for the teaching of, and instruction in, the minority language meet the
requirements stipulated by the Charter.
According to the language proficiency of school-children and youngsters, and in accordance
with the parents' wishes, different school structures have been developed for the teaching of,
and in, the minority language. While the Danish private-school system and the Sorbian
publicly maintained schools have a long tradition of such language teaching, the teaching of
the Frisian languages is still in an initial stage and its integration into instruction is based on
different concepts. In this respect, the present Report can only provide information on the
current state of affairs. Inclusion of the Ro many language in the instruction offered at
schools is, at present, confined to pilot measures, depending on the wishes expressed by
parents to this effect. However, use of the Low German language within school education is,
for the major part, still in the initial stages of development, the essential conditions for
which include an appropriate interest shown by parents and pupils, in addition to the basic
requirements such as curricula, etc., and teachers proficient in that language.
For details, cf. the comments below in Part C of the Report regarding the obligations
specifically entered into.

re: para. 1, para. g
(g)

the provision of facilities enabling non-speakers of a regional or
minority language living in the area where it is used to learn it if
they so desire;

This obligation refers to the wishes of non-speakers of a regional or minority language who
live in an area where such a language is used. As a general policy matter it is to be pointed
out that the offers for learning the respective language - cf. the detailed comments on Article
8 of the Charter (Education) in Part C below - are available to all persons, irrespective of
whether or not they are members of the given language group. In addition, depending on the
respective circumstances, special offers for learning such languages are available on a
limited scale (e.g. at many adult education centres in the settlement areas, or in the form of
activities and offers by clubs and associations of the language groups).
Since measures taken in the interest of regional or minority languages under Article 7, para.
4, [cf. p. 39 below] shall take account also of the wishes expressed by the speakers of such
languages, the provision of sub-paragraph (g) cannot be applied to the Romany language
since, according to the wishes frequently expressed by the members of this language group,
outsiders must not be taught this la nguage.

re: para. 1, para. h
(h)

the promotion of study and research on regional or minority
languages at universities or equivalent institutions;

Under the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, implementation of this
provision is incumbent on the Länder, in particular. In the field of research, several Länder

33

of the Federal Republic of Germany already established State-run research institutions with
the pertinent terms of refe rence, or on a continuous basis support private research
institutions of the minorities.
For details, cf. the comments below in Part C of the Report regarding the obligations
specifically entered into.
re: para. 1, para. I
(i)

the promotion of appropriate types of transnational exchanges, in
the fields covered by this Charter, for regional or minority
languages used in identical or similar form in two or more States.

In this respect, reference is made to the observations regarding para. 1, sub-para. (e) [p. 30
above].
Article 7, para. 2
(2)
The Parties undertake to eliminate, if they have not yet done so, any
unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference relating to the
use of a regional or mi nority language and intended to discourage or
endanger the maintenance or development of it. The adoption of special
measures in favour of regional or minority languages aimed at promoting
equality between the users of these languages and the rest of the population
or which take due account of their specific conditions is not considered to
be an act of discrimination against the users of more widely-used
languages.
1. Equality before the law and the prohibition of factually unwarranted unequal treatment
(discrimination) are the keystones of a democratic body politic and, at the same time, of
the protection of national minorities and language groups, which aims at the peaceful
living together of various ethnic groups in a state community in which tolerance
prevails. The principle of equa lity before the law and the ban on discrimination are
enshrined in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany and in the Constitutions
of the Länder, as well as in various subject-specific laws, and comply with the
obligations under paragraph 2.
2. For the speakers of regional or minority languages, special importance attaches to the
right to free development of one's personality under Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law,
which inter alia leaves the use of the respective minority language, maintenance of the
relevant autonomous culture, and preservation of the minority identity to each
individual. Article 3, para. 3, 1st sentence, of the Basic Law stipulates that no person
shall be favoured or disfavoured because of sex, parentage, race, language, homeland
and origin, faith, or religious or political opinions.
3. In some of the Land Constitutions, additional safeguards have been included to enforce
the ban on discrimination - thus, for instance, in Articles 1 and 134 of the Hessian
Constitution, Article 6 of the Constitution of the Free State of Saxony, Article 12 of the
Constitution for the Land of Brandenburg, Article 1 of the Constitution of the Land of
Schleswig- Holstein, and Article 2, para. 1, of the Constitution of the Land of BadenWurttemberg. In the Constitution of Berlin, in Article 10, para. 2, an overarching nondiscrimination clause has been included, under which "nobody shall be prejudiced or
favoured because of their sex, birth, race, language, national or social origin, faith,

34

religion or political opinions". In the Land Constitution of North Rhine/Westphalia, in
its Article 4, para. 1, the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of belonging to a
national minority in that Land has also been expressly laid down. In Bremen, the ban on
discriminaton is enshrined in Article 2 of the Land Constitution.
4. Germany does not have a "state culture" regulated by legal provisions. Rather, Article 2,
para. 1, of the Basic Law guarantees everybody the right to free development of his/her
personality. This, inter alia, protects the individual's self- realization according to his/her
own ideas. Legal protection not only covers the right to free development within a
spiritual and cultural core sphere of the individual as a mental/spiritual and ethical
being, but - entirely without reference to any specific values - the object of legal
protection is a general form of freedom of action in a broad sense - and thus covering
language as well. This right, however, is only guaranteed to the extent that the rights of
others or the constitutiona l order or the moral law are not violated.
Apart from the fundamental objective of achieving, in sociopolitical terms, the
integration of all groups of society, the Federal Republic of Germany regards the
cultural diversity of its regions and of the groups of its population as an enriching asset.
Consequently, the policies concerning the national minorities are not oriented towards
assimilation, but are aimed at preserving and further developing their respective
identity. The measures taken by the Bund, the Länder and local authorities, which are
mentioned in the present Report or are covered by examples given in this Report, serve
to vigorously promote the initiatives of the organizations of national minorities and
ethnic groups for the preservation of the given language and culture. The general public
in the Federal Republic of Germany supports this policy.
Complaints by members of minorities concerning assimilation efforts or any measures
aimed in this direction have not become known.

Article 7, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to promote, by appropriate measures, mutual
understanding between all the linguistic groups of the country and in
particular the inclusion of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation
to regional or minority languages among the objectives of education and
training provided within their countries and encouragement of the mass
media to pursue the same objective.
1. Tolerance, intercultural dialogue, and mutual acceptance are indispensable elements of
the peaceful co-existence of people from different cultural backgrounds, on the basis of
mutual respect and understanding. This objective is one of the most important tasks of
domestic politics in Germany. It is only in this way that a positive social climate can be
created, which will also benefit the situation of national minorities and ethnic groups.
The Federal Republic of Germany has a Federal Government Commissioner for Matters
Relating to Aliens, whose office is provided for in the Aliens Act of the Federal Republic
of Germany. She has, inter alia, the task to further the conditions for foreigners and
Germans, as well as various groups of non-nationals, to live together in a setting which
is as free of tensions as possible, to promote their mutual understanding, and to prevent
and counteract xenophobia.

The tasks of the Land Commissioners for Matters Relating to Aliens include the
analysis of conflicts between Germans and foreigners, and the development of measures
to encourage tolerance and acceptance. This is achieved by wide-ranging and diversified
public information/education activities, by supporting the self-organization of migrants'
and refugees' associations, and by ol cal Aliens Advisory Councils (to the extent that
provision has been made for such bodies in the legislation of the various Länder).
In Germany, education in tolerance and solidarity is also part of the educational
mandate of schools providing general education, and of political education, and ranks
high in these fields. In addition, many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
private initiatives are dedicated to this goal, which is also supported by the political
parties, and to the practical implementation of the intercultural dialogue.
2. In the areas of education, culture and the media, the aforementioned principles are
embodied in laws and implementing statutes. The Bund and the Länder implement these
regulations by means of many and various measures. For one part, such measures are
aimed at education in tolerance and at promoting understanding for other cultures and
languages as well as acceptance of people with a different language and culture who
live in the neighbourhood, the local community and the overall community of society.
Other measures are aimed at increasing, among the general public, the knowledge
concerning the existence of national minorities and ethnic groups and at familiarizing
the majority population with the culture of those groups and the related traditions. In
this field, the efforts concerning information in schools and political education will have
to be increased outside the central settlement areas of the groups protected under the
Framework Convention, so as to ensure a broader information basis in society.
2.1 Political education and schools
2.1.1
The Federal Centre for Political Education (BpP) has the task, through
political education activities, to promote, among the German people, the understanding
of political facts and processes, to strengthen democratic consciousness, and to
encourage greater readiness for political involvement. It also has the particular task of
providing scientifically sound and substantiated information on political key issues,
strengthening the democratic basic consensus and, on these foundations, promoting the
development of a culture of (democratic) political dispute on the basis of a rational
dialogue. This also includes information on the living together of the various cultures
represented in Germany, and on the reduction of prejudice and xenophobia (e.g. the
monographs on "Arguments against hatred - About prejudice, xenophobia and rightwing
extremism", 3rd reprint 1997, and the "Encyclopædia of ethnic minorities in Germany").
A broad-based study, which was presented at the end of 1997, confirmed that the
materials prepared by the Federal Centre for Political Education are used, with
extraordinary frequency, in class and in the preparation of lessons. The high degree of
acceptance of these publications and materials was attributed primarily to their
politically well-balanced presentation.
During the European Year against Racism and Xenophobia (1997), the Federal Centre
for Political Education, under the motto of "Dialogue of Cultures", organized a
Congress which was attended by more than 3,000 participants. At the suggestion of the
Federal President, a concept was developed for related events/meetings, centred around
the work of many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) which come out against
racism and stand up for tolerance, international understanding and humanitarianism. At

36

some 80 meetings/events held centrally and decentrally, the participants analysed and
discussed various subjects and the actual implementation of the intercultural dialogue.
All Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany have established Land Centres for
Political Education which carry out similar tasks in their respective Land. The Hamburg
Land Centre for Political Education is here given as an example: inter alia, it regularly
sponsors associations dealing with the co-existence of, and mutual understanding
between, different religions and nationalities. As part of the "Rechtsextremismus und
Gewalt" [Right-Wing Extremism and Violence] Programme, activities to further mutual
understanding between young people of different nationalities are promoted and
guidance is given with regard to personal courage in standing up for one's convictions
when faced with conflicts and violence.
The Hamburg Land Centre actively pursues the following activities, among others:
- promotion of events organized by the registered association "Interreligiös begegnen
und voneinander lernen e.V." [Cross-religion encounters, and learning from each
other];
- assistance for the "Jews and Muslims in Germany" activity organized by
Katholische Akademie, with the support of the Federal Centre for Political
Education and Orient-Institut Hamburg;
- promotion of round-table talks, discussions and reports sponsored by Brücke
Mittelmeer [Mediterranean Bridge], which brings together scientists/scholars and
representatives of very diverse associatio ns wishing to foster and advance the
intercultural dialogue between Europe and the various Mediterranean riparian states,
especially about Islamism and education in tolerance.
2.1.2
On account of the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the
Länder have jurisdiction over school education and are responsible for pre-school
education. Many Land laws contain provisions on education in tolerance. Thus, for instance, Section 4 of the School Act of Brandenburg Land lays down, as an objective of
school education, that the ability and readiness of pupils should be enhanced "to
understand their own culture as well as other cultures, also within their own country and
in their own personal environment, and to help to achieve the peaceful co-existence of
cultures and peoples, and to stand up for the dignity and equal status of all humankind".
Section 5 of the Children's Day-Care Centres Act of Schleswig- Holstein Land lays
down, e.g. in its paragraph 6, that the work of children's day-care centres sha ll promote
"the living together of children of different national or cultural origin". Similar
provisions are contained in the respective laws of the other Länder as well.
For the implementation of these provisions, many measures have been taken in schools,
including the field of pre-school education. On 25 October 1996, the Standing
Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder endorsed the
Recommendation on "Intercultural Education in Schools". It contains the following
observation: "The Europe in School Education Decision taken in 1978, and reconfirmed
in 1990, is aimed at promoting the European dimension in education by means, inter
alia, of fostering readiness and openness for understanding, for reducing prejudices, and
for cross-cultural open- mindedness". In this context, the following are regarded as
particularly significant aspects: familiarization with human rights as universally valid
values; the issue of the cultural environment that conditions human rights; and the
possibilities for the living together of minorities and majorities in

37

multicultural/multiethnic societies. Accordingly, the existing directives and school
curricula provide for the introduction of intercultural aspects in school education.
2.2 Culture
The Länder - which, on account of the federal structure of Germany, have responsibility
for cultural and educational affairs - and local authorities include the culture of groups
other than the German majority population in supraregional, regional and local cult ural
events and activities. Cases in point are, for instance, large-scale Land festivals ["days"
dedicated to the special character of the respective Land] such as Schleswig-HolsteinTag, Hessen-Tag, Tag der Sachsen and Brandenburg-Tag.
2.3 Media
Jurisdiction over broadcasting also lies with the Länder. Under constitutional law, the
State may not exert an influence on the contents of broadcasting programmes.
The broadcasting programming principles embodied in the various Land Broadcasting
Acts and State Treaties explicitly lay down, inter alia, that international understanding
shall be promoted, and programmes shall help to reduce xenophobia and to achieve
protection and promotion of minorities (cf. for example: Section 7 of the State Treaty on
the Broadcasting Corporation NDR (Norddeutscher Rundfunk), Section 20 of the Lower
Saxony Land Broadcasting Act, or Section 24 of the Schleswig-Holstein Land
Broadcasting Act).
Compliance with the programming principles is monitored, for public service
broadcasting, by the supervisory bodies (Sound Broadcasting Board, Television Board)
which have a pluralistic membership.
3. For a number of years, xenophobia [anti- foreigner hostility] on the part of a small
segment of the German population, including younger members of fringe groups, has
become a problem in society. It increasingly emerges in the "new Länder" [i.e. those of
the former East German GDR], and has ranged from verbal attacks to outrages, also
violents acts involving loss of life, primarily against foreigners of non- European origin
who live in Germany. So far, the members of the language groups considered in this
Report have, as a rule, not been targeted by xenophobic acts of violence. In a number of
cases, however, there have been attacks against German Sinti and Roma. The fight
against racism and xenophobia is an important concern of German politics, with
particular importance attaching to the aspect of prevention through intellectual/political
analysis and discussion.
In addition to the protection provided by criminal law, political education and
intellectual/political discussion of extremism, xenophobia and violence are of major
significance in view of eliminating the breeding ground of extremist ideology and thus
helping to prevent politically motivated acts of violence. Through political education,
school education and preve ntion-directed public information, the values of our free
democratic order are made clear, and people are made aware that violence never can,
and never must, be a means of settling political differences of opinion.
The Secretariat for the Forum gegen Rassismus ("Forum against Racism") has been
established at the Federal Ministry of the Interior. On account of the federal structure of

38

the Federal Republic of Germany, primary responsibility for these aspects lies with the
Länder in the fields of culture and education.
A central instrument of intellectual/political discussion are the extensive public
information/education activities of the Bund and the Länder, the form and contents of
which are geared to specific target groups. This includes brochures on the subjects of
extremism and xenophobia; seminars for teachers, for contributors to school magazines,
journalists and multipliers in adult education; specialist conferences on issues of sociopolitics; awareness-raising campaigns against extremism, xenophobia and violence; and
also the initiation, monitoring and support of sociologic research activities in the field of
internal security; and evaluation and application of analyses and research findings by
means of publications.
Various effectual public-oriented measures which proved successful already in the past
are being continued. Pertinent examples are the campaign entitled FAIRSTÄNDNIS* Menschenwürde achten - Gegen Fremdenhass (Fairness and Understanding - Respect
for Human Dignity - Against Xenophobia and Racism) which was initiated in 1993 by
the Bund [Federation] and the Länder; the organization of 6 to 8 seminars per year for
social multipliers on the subject of extremism and violence; the publication of 4 to 6
brochures per year in the series "Texte zur Inneren Sicherheit" [Texts on Internal
Security]; and the annual edition of the Constitutional Protection Report which provides
an information basis for assessing the threats posed to the democratic constitutional
state by racism, xenophobia and other trends and factors.
Scientific research on the causes of, and motives for, racism and xenophobia helps to
further develop and optimize concepts for sustained preventive measures. Therefore, the
Federal Ministry of the Interior analyses current studies of these phenomena or, in
instances, initiates its own research projects. At present, Deutsches Jugendinstitut
[German Youth (Research) Institute] in Munich and the University of Jena, under a
commission by the Ministry and with the support of Volkswagenwerk Foundation, carry
out an extensive research project on right-extremist suspects and offenders, as a followup to the study completed in 1994 on the "Analysis of Xenophobic Offenders" and to
the study on "Anti- Alien Acts of Violence Committed by Young Offenders" which was
commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Justice and published in 1995. Given the
broader empirical basis, the combination of quantitative and qualitative sur vey methods
and the broadened scope of the subject-matter covered, the current research project
promises to yield further substantial findings regarding the causes of, and motives for,
racism and xenophobia. In the spring of 2000, Erlangen University completed another
research project commissioned by the Federal Ministry of the Interior on the violence
phenomenon of hooliganism. This study also probes the extent to which anti-alien or
right-extremist motives play a role in connection with the specific "hooligan" category
of offenders.
Public debate on, and analysis of, racism and xenophobia is a task for society as a whole
to tackle. Therefore, the Federal Government continues the dialogue taken up in the
context of the "European Year against Racism and Xenophobia" (1997) between the
Government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). A mutual exchange of
information and experience on this subject-matter is carried out, in particular, in the
"Forum against Racism" which was constituted in March 1998.

39

However, if the fight against extremism, xenophobia and violence is to be successful on
a sustained basis, the socially relevant forces (families, schools, churches, sports
associations, trade unions, employers, etc.) will have to be involved on a substantially
larger scale. This is the aim of the Alliance for Democracy and Tolerance - Against
Extremism and Xenophobia which was initiated by the Federal Government. The aim is
to provide, on the broadest scale possible, for the information and mobilization of the
general public and for awareness-raising regarding these issues, with a focus on public
information/education and, above all, on providing a set of values. If the Alliance is to
succeed in its efforts, the multifarious measures and action concepts deve loped at
various levels to fight racism and xenophobia must be efficiently co-ordinated and
brought into focus. The governmental measures are widely supported by the media in
the Federal Republic of Germany (press and broadcasting media) and social actors as
well as by the majority of the population.
3. The specific anti- xenophobia concepts developed and implemented by the Bund are
matched by similar measures taken by the Länder. An example is furnished by
Brandenburg Land, one of the traditional settlement areas of the Sorbs (Wends). In
1998, the Brandenburg Land Government presented an action concept against violence,
right-wing extremism and xenophobia, the key elements of which are the following:
- an alliance for action against violence, right-wing extremism and xenophobia (this
project, which is supported with substantial Land funds, is to mobilize society for
tolerance, solidarity and internationality; the projects of this Alliance are very
heterogeneous);
- condemnation of violence, by intensified public discussion in the media and
schools;
- establishment of counselling bureaus for the victims of offences committed by
right-wing extremists and offences of suspected anti-alien motivation;
- support for counselling services sponsored by local authorities;
- support for the development of local structures for the integration of new
inhabitants;
- qualification of professional educators for handling and managing violence and
right-wing extremism;
- preventive work with youngsters already having a record of offences in this regard
and with youth groups;
- creation of suitable police mechanisms to respond to anti-alien violence (example:
establishment of "Mobile Einsatztrupps gegen Gewalt und Ausländerfeindlichkeit"
[Mobile Task Forces against Violence and Anti-Foreigner Hostility]).
The above measures are to prevent or punish all forms of discrimination against persons
belonging to other ethnic groups. This also applies to the Sorbian/Wendish minority. It
is to be noted, however, that acts of violence against persons belonging to the Sorbian
(Wendish) ethnic group have so far not become known. Isolated cases of verbal attacks
on representatives of the Sorbs, or posters containing insulting or severely
discriminatory/racist statements were acts committed by individual offenders.
5. In 1999, the total number of registered criminal offences with proven or suspected rightextremist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic background was 10,037. Thus, as compared to
the previous year, the total number of criminal offences dropped by 9.2 %. As in the

40

previous years, 66.9 % of all criminal offences were 'propaganda offences'#). In 1999,
there were 47 cases of desecration of Jewish cemeteries. While this number, too,
declined, it must be pointed out, however, that already during the first months of the
year 2000 other incidents involving desecration occurred in Göttingen, Guben and
Hanover.
Notwithstanding the general decline of criminal offences, the number of right-wing
extremist acts of violence rose by 5.4 % to 746. Of these, 60 % were of xenophobic
motivation.
Propensity to violence is noted primarily among the right-wing extremist skinheads in
East Germany where, in 1999, almost half of such offences were committed - although
only 21 % of the population of the Federal Republic live in East Germany, including all
of Berlin.
Right-wing extremism is a phenomenon that must be fought on a nation-wide scale in a
sustained effort. In view of the regional distribution outlined above as regards acts of
violence and violence-inclined skinheads, the problem at present is particularly much in
evidence in East Germany. The Federal Government will, within its means, continue to
support the measures taken by the Länder to fight right-wing extremism, especially by
providing the necessary public-policy framework.

Article 7, para. 4
(4)
In determining their policy with regard to regional or minority
languages, the Parties shall take into consideration the needs and wishes
expressed by the groups which use such languages. They are encouraged to
establish bodies, if necessary, for the purpose of advising the authorities on
all matters pertaining to regional or minority languages.
1. Paragraph 4 contains two different obligations. On the one hand, the Contracting
Parties, in determining their policy with regard to regional or minority languages,
undertake to take account of the needs or wishes expressed by groups using such
languages. Since the Charter grants the Contracting Parties the right to make their own
decisions regarding the various measures to be taken for the implementation of the
objectives and principles of the Charter, the provision in paragraph 4 does not imply
that the Contracting Parties would, without being able to make their own decisions,
have to accept the wishes of the users of such languages with regard to the nature and
scope of the pertinent measures; rather, it means in particular that measures to
implement the obligations under the Charter should not be taken against the explicit
wish of the users of regional or minority languages. Thus, this provision does not affect
measures taken in keeping with the general legal order, provided that these will not
jeopardize, or impair, the preservation and development of the given regional or
minority language.
In instances, it is difficult for the competent public authorities to establish what actually
are the wishes of the users of regional or minority languages since, in instances, the
#)

referring to "use of insignia of anti-constitutional organizations" and "dissemination of propaganda material of anti-constitutional organizations" (Sections 86 and 86a of the Penal Code) [Translator's Note]

41

needs and wishes expressed by umbrella organizations, regional organizations or
independent associations of a language group or by the language users concerned, e.g.
by parents, differ widely. A single association, union or initiative group cannot
generally claim to reflect the view of all members of a language group. If the needs and
wishes differ, the only choice left to the authorities is to meet them in a reasonable way
and within the limits of what is possible.
The divergence of views on the protection duties is a topical issue as regards the
Romany language of the German Sinti and Roma. During the ratification procedure, the
Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, with its nine Land Associations, and other
associations and instit utions affiliated with the Council pleaded for inclusion of the
Romany language in the scope of application of the Charter and for its protection under
Part III. It has not been possible to notify Romany for protection under Part III since the
Bund and the Länder could not, in this respect, assume the required minimum number
of 35 obligations. This is due to the dispersed settlement of the German Sinti and Roma
and to the fact that knowledge of the Romany language is confined to the members of
the traditional minority (refusal to have the language studied by out siders). Since,
however, the prevailing law and the existing administrative practice in Germany meet
individual provisions of Part III of the Charter, Germany has opted for a compromise
rejected by the Central Council, by notifying the Council of Europe, in a Declaration [of
26 January 1998, cf. Annex 3], of the attained number of obligations (18 for the entire
Federal territory, a total of up to 31 for the territories of various Länder), as a voluntary
commitment of the Federal Republic of Germany, and by including these obligations
in the procedure relating to the federal act ratifying the Charter.
By a decision taken in mid-1998, the Land of Hesse declared the acceptance of an
additional number of obligations so that now a total number of 35 undertakings have
been entered into, which make it possible for the Romany language to be registered for
protection under Part III for Hesse. The Central Council of German Sinti and Roma
continues to encourage other Länder as well to enter into similar obligations.
Associations of German Sinti, which co-operate within the Sinti Allianz Deutschland
e.V. ("Sinti Alliance Germany, reg'd"), see themselves as an ethnic Sinti group within
the German people, which - without discrimination and, at the same time, without
reliance on the protective provisions of the Charter - wishes to be integrated and to
cultivate the traditional language at the private level, without any governmental action
in this sector. These Sinti reject inclusion of the Romany language in the scope of
application of the Charter and, in this context, point out that this is in keeping with the
centuries-old legal order exacting that this language, which is go verned by the taboo
system, must not be made accessible to anybody outside the Sinti community. The
government side has responded to this with the explanatory comment that the protection
and promotion of the Romany language, as pursued by Germany, solely is an offer to
the language group and that it is up to every individual concerned to avail him/herself of
this offer or not to make any use of it.
2. The second obligation under paragraph 4 encourages the Contracting Parties to establish
bodies, if necessary, for advising the authorities on all matters pertaining to regional or
minority languages. Within the meaning of the Explanatory Report, this provision is to
be taken to mean that such bodies should not be established only if they do not already
exist. However, the Contracting Parties are only encouraged, and not placed under the
obligation, to establish bodies for this purpose.

42

In the Federal Republic of Germany, bodies looking after the interests of regional or
minority languages already exist in the form of advisory committees or consultative
councils (cf. the detailed comments in Part A, para. 4, above [pp. 12 seqq.]). Given the
considerable differences regarding the situation of the various languages in the regions
or Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany, a uniform structure for related advisory
tasks would not seem a promising approach. Therefore, the Bund and the Länder share
the view that, as a first step, use should be made of the existing bodies and that
experience should be gained as to the ways in which these bodies might help with the
practical implementation of the Charter. In this regard, particular mention is to be made
of the regular conference on the implementation of the Charter (cf. the comments in Part
A, para. 4.2, above [p. 12]). It is only on the basis of the above activities that the
question should be studied as to whether, and in which areas, additional bodies might be
required.

Article 7, para. 5
(5)
The Parties undertake to apply, mutatis mutandis, the principles
listed in paragraphs 1 to 4 above to non-territorial languages. However, as
far as these languages are concerned, the nature and scope of the measures
to be taken to give effect to this Charter shall be determined in a flexible
manner, bearing in mind the needs and wishes, and respecting the
traditions and characteristics, of the groups which use the languages
concerned.

The Contracting Parties are obliged to apply, mutatis mutandis, the principles listed in paras.
1 to 4 to non-territorial languages. The nature and scope of these measures designed to give
effect to the Charter must be determined in a flexible manner, while bearing in mind the
needs and wishes of the users of such languages and respecting their traditions and
characteristics.
As evidenced by the foregoing sections and by the explanatory comments in Part C below
regarding Part III of the Charter, this provision is only of little practical importance to the
Federal Republic of Germany.

43

Part C

Measures to Promote the Use of Regional or Minority
Languages in Public Life in accordance with the Obligations
under Part III of the Charter, entered into under Article 2,
paragraph 2

For ease of reference, all of the protected languages are covered in the comments below; i.e.
in accordance with the [German] Declaration regarding Part II of the Charter [cf. Annex 3],
the various obligations being met are listed also for the Romany language in the entire
Federal territory, and for Low German in the three Länder listed in the Declaration.
In the following, general policy remarks to the various Articles describe the overall
conditions applying to all of the protected languages in all of the Länder.

Article 8
Education
On account of the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the Länder have
jurisdiction over educational matters. Therefore, implementation of the provisions of this
Article is, in particular, a responsibility of the Länder.
In the field of education in the Länder, promoting the knowledge of the culture, history,
languages and religion of the respective minorities/language groups as well as of the
majority population is part of the curricula of publicly maintained and private schools.
An important role in imparting knowledge of the culture of the language groups, in and
outside schools, is also played by the state institutions for political education - i.e. the
Federal Centre and the Land Centres for Polical Education (cf. the comments in Part B
regarding Article 7, para. 3, under no. 2.1.1 [p. 34 above]). The language groups regard the
education/information activities carried out so far outside the central settlement areas as
insufficient and, in particular, miss a nation-wide survey concerning the five language
groups. The Federal Government and the Länder endeavour to further improve the available
educational and informational offers regarding the language groups concerned.

Article 9
Judicial Authorities
Section 184 of the Organisation of the Courts Act lays down that the official language in
court is German. An exemption applies in the case of the Sorbian language (cf. the
comments regarding Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (a), with reference to Sorbian [p. 79
below].
As regards the legal consequences of legal documents, German procedural law does not
distinguish between documents drafted in German and those drawn up in any other
language. Under Section 142, para. 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court may order a
translation to be produced of documents drafted in a foreign language.

44

The constitutional stipulations regarding fair trial and due process of law (Article 20, para.
3, of the Basic Law, confirmed as a constitutional right by Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic
Law), however, entail the obligation for courts also to take note of declarations made by
parties to a lawsuit in a fo reign language. If the court hearing is attended by persons who do
not know the German language, an interpreter must be called in (Section 185 of the
Organisation of the Courts Act).
Similarly, during preliminary investigation by the public prosecutor, the accused must be
informed, in a language he/she understands, of the offence with which he/she is charged and
must be given an opportunity to present his/her view [in that language] on the alleged
offence. As soon as it becomes obvious that communication is not possible for language
reasons, involvement of an interpreter is mandatory also in this case. Articles 5, para. 2, and
6, para. 3, litt. a, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) also stipulate this right. Article 9 of the Charter does not
contain any obligations going beyond the provisions of the ECHR, and thus in Germany is
already part of the (established) law in force. Apart from a few exceptions, however, the
members of the language groups understand German so that these problems do not arise in
practice.

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
Under German law, the official language is German. The obligation under Article 10 is
confined to areas which are inhabitated, traditionally or in substantial numbers, by members
of the language groups, and in Germany applies, in particular, to the settlement areas of the
Danish minority, of the Sorbian people and of the North Frisians and the Saterland Frisians.
The German Sinti and Roma are dispersed more or less throughout Germany, while - by
contrast to the aforementioned groups - no major number of them is known to live in one
particular place or region.
On account of the mostly small number of members of minorities as a percentage of the
given local population, it is not possible, in general, to use the minority language in relations
with the administrative authorities; rather, such use is confined to special regulations. This
does not, however, mean that the relations between members of such language groups and
administrative authorities are rendered difficult, since all members of those groups - apart
from a few exceptions - are bilingual and have no problems with using the German
language. Where the legal and practical scope for using the minority and regional languages
in relations with administrative authorities does exist, the major part of the members of the
language groups scarcely avail themselves of this possibility.
However, in the view of the Danish minority, of the Sorbs and the Frisians, further
development of the existing practical scope for such use would be desirable because this
would increase public awareness as regards the existence of minority languages and would
provide additional incentives to the subsequent generation to retain the minority language.
This will be one of the subjects of the planned Conference of the Federal Ministry of the
Interior with the Länder and local governments of the minority settlement areas and with
representatives of the minorities, which is to be held in the year 2000 as part of the activities
to implement the European Charter for Regional or Minority La nguages.

45

The language groups suggest that for better minority language communication on the part of
the staff of local and regional administrations, local authorities might encourage
participation in language courses and that, in the recruitment and the professional activity of
staff members, their proficiency in the minority language might be particularly taken into
account as an additional qualification.
For all protected languages, the obligation under Article 10, para. 5, i.e. to allow the use or
adoption of family names in the regional or minority languages, is regulated by a federal act
as follows:
The Act of 22 July 1997 Ratifying the Council of Europe Framework Convention of 1
February 1995 for the Protection of National Minorities contains, as its Article 2, the Act to
implement Article 11, paragraph 1 of the Framework Convention (Act on Name Changes by
Minorities (MindNamÄndG)). With the entry into force of the Act Ratifying the Framework
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities on 23 July 1997, this obligations has
thus become applicable law in the Federal Republic of Germany with regard to the members
of the Danish minority, the Sorbian people, the Frisian ethnic group and the German Sinti
and Roma.
The members of national minorities and of other ethnic groups traditionally resident in
Germany to whom the Framework Convention and the German law governing names apply,
may assume the minority- language version of their names by making a pertinent declaration
before the Registrar [of the Civil Registry Office]. With the 13th General Regulatory Order
to Amend the General Regulatory Order to Implement the Act on Civil Status ("Stand ing
Instructions for Registrars and Their Supervisory Authorities with regard to the Act on Civil
Status") of 2 June 1998 (Supplement to the Bundesanzeiger [Official Gazette of the Federal
Republic], no. 107), which entered into force on 1 July 1998, account was taken of the
provisions of the Framework Convention by including the provisions of the Act [on Civil
Status] in Section 381a of the Standing Instructions and having them applied in registry
office practice. Adaptation of a name may be effected by translation of the name into the
minority language if the name also denotes a specific term and thus is translatable from one
language into another. If the name cannot be translated, it may be adapted to the pho netic
particularities of the given minority language. Members of national minorities whose former
names in the minority language had been given a German form or had been changed to
another name, may again assume those original names. A pertinent declaration before the
Registrar suffices for adapting a name to the special features of the given minority language.
The Standing Instructions for Registrars and Their Supervisory Authorities take account of
the orthographic particularities of the names of members of national minorities by providing
that the diacritics (graphic accents, hooks, etc.) in names or other words shall be retained as
such. The change of a person's surname at birth will affect the married name of the person
making such declaration only if the spouse also makes such a name-change declaration
before the Registrar. Extension of such name changes to the children of the person making
the declaration or of his/her spouse is governed by the provisions of the Civil Code of the
Federal Republic of Germany.
Section 3 of the MindNamÄndG provides that no fees shall be charged for acceptance of a
declaration to this effect and for its certification or authentication [recording].
The number of persons making use of the right to have their names changed is not covered
by the statistics of the Civil Registry Offices. There are no provisions laying down any
general obligation of Civil Registry Offices to report to any registry supervisory bodies.

Media
In Germany, general freedom of expression is extensively guaranteed under Article 5, para.
1, 1st sentence, of the Basic Law and under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).
The Basic Law safeguards the right freely to express and disseminate one's opinions in
speech, writing, and pictures, as well as the right to withhold one's personal opinion
("negative freedom of expression"). Opinions thus protected are all types and forms of
[personal] judgments or of beha viour; the notion of "opinion" must generally be understood
in its broadest sense and, in addition to value judgments, also covers allegations of fact
where these are a prerequisite for forming opinions. Thus - as an input to, and basis for,
analysis and discussion - also false, reprehensible and rating expressions of opinion are
protected - within, of course, the limits prescribed by Article 5, para. 2, of the Basic Law
(i.e. violation of the provisions of general laws, legal provisions on the protection of young
persons, and the right to inviolability of personal honour). Freedom of expression is
accorded to all German nationals and thus, of course, to the members of the language groups
protected under the Charter, and to foreigners.
The basic right to free speech primarily provides protection against government
interference. But in addition, it places the State under the obligation to safeguard this freedom. Article 5, para. 1, 1 st sentence, of the Basic Law also guarantees freedom of information - the right to inform oneself [without hindrance, from generally accessible sources] - as
a particular right. Such protection extends both to the active procurement of information and
to merely receiving information. Especially the Danish minority in Schleswig-Holstein
make - transfrontier - use of the broadcasting programmes and press products from the
Kingdom of Denmark in their traditional settlement area.
The right to freedom of expression is also particularly manifested in the freedom to create
and use media (press, broadcasting, and other communications media). Article 5, para. 1, 2nd
and 3rd sentences, of the Basic Law guarantees freedom of the press and freedom of
reporting by means of broadcasts and films, without censorship. Freedom of the press and of
broadcasting particularly implies the principle of governmental non-intervention, which
prohibits any state interference which is not compatible with the freedom of the press and of
broadcasting or which is not warranted by the limitations of such rights as provided under
Article 5, para. 2, of the Basic Law.
For the press, these constitutional guarantees have been developed in detail and confirmed
by the judicial decisions (rulings) of the Federal Constitutional Court and by the various
Land Press Acts. This provides the basis for the free and economically autonomous
development of the press in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Freedom of broadcasting, like freedom of the press, is an essential factor in the public
opinion- forming process and in the articulation of the political will. Like the press,
broadcasting has institutional autonomy. For compliance with the constitutional mandate of
broadcasting, it will not suffice for the State to refrain from any interference whatsoever
and, in all other respects, to leave broadcasting for the social actors to deal with. Rather, the
requirement is for some regulatory structure. The Federal Republic of Germany has the
socalled dual broadcasting system - i.e. the existence of public-service and private

47

broadcasters side by side - by which the State guarantees that, through the overall offer by
all broadcasters, reporting meets the requirements stipulated in the Constitution for balanced
diversity, i.e. promoting the individual's freedom to form his/her own opinion and depiction
of cultural diversity.
The federal structure of Germany assigns responsibility for broadcasting, and thus for
ensurance of diversity of opinions, to the Länder. The legal basis for broadcasting is
provided by the Broadcasting State Treaties concluded between the Länder, which lay
down the minimum requirements according to which the Länder, within their respective
jurisdiction, have issued detailed regulations in their Land Media Acts. Article 5, para. 1, 2nd
sentence, of the Basic Law (freedom of broadcasting) does not require a Land to adopt a
specific organizational form of broadcasting. However, the Land is obliged to make certain
provisions to ensure freedom of broadcasting. As a matter of public interest, broadcasting
must be operated above party lines and in full independence and must be protected against
any biased intervention. The public-service broadcasters, in particular, must furnish
comprehensive information within the ir overall programme and allow full pluralism of
opinions. As regards private broadcasting, the legislator also must ensure that such private
operators meet the constitutional requirements and, in particular, that a maximum of
balanced diversity is achieved. The existing regulations regarding licensing of broadcasters
are based exclusively on objective criteria. The licensing conditions are laid down in the
various Land Media Acts.
In all cases, the applicant must have his residence or the domicile of his company in the area
to which the Basic Law applies (in some of the Länder, this may also be a location in the EU
Member States). Granting of a licence also depends on whether the applicant has the
qualification for lawful provision of broadcasting programmes, i.e. meets the financial and
legal requirements with regard to programming. Moreover, programmes must be in
accordance with the general programming princ iples as laid down in the Broadcasting State
Treaty concluded between the Länder; these include, inter alia, compliance with the
constitutional order and respect for human dignity. In addition, the Land Media Acts lay
down various requirements to be met by private broadcasters which, however, are also
based exclusively on objective criteria.
If an application for licensing is refused, an objection may be filed, or an action be brought,
in accordance with the general legal provisions.
Article 3, paras. 1 and 3, of the Basic Law prohibits any discrimination with regard to access
to the media so that also the language groups may have access on the same conditions as the
majority population. In this regard, particular mention is to be made of the supervisory and
control bodies which have to safeguard diversity of opinions and ensure compliance with
the programming principles of broadcasting. The relevant major political,
philosophical/ideological and social groups are granted adequate participation in the
supervisory bodies of the public-service broadcasters and of the Land Supervisory
Authorities for Private Broadcasters [Land Broadcasting Institutions], i.e. the Broadcasting
Board and the Broadcasting Commission/Media Council. Membership of these bodies is so
diversified that all socially relevant groups are provided sufficient opportunity to have their
say. In addition to representing the interests of their associations or groups, the members of
these bodies also contribute comprehensive and multi- faceted views on socially important
issues to the deliberations of these bodies.

48

The issue of the represent ation of national minorities on these media boards was the sub ject
of an action brought by the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma. Controlling the
public-service broadcasters primarily is the broadcasters' internal responsibility and is
incumbent on the supervisory bodies, i.e. the Broadcasting Board and the Board of
Administration. Responsibility for controlling private broadcasters lies with the Land
Supervisory Authorities [Land Broadcasting Institutions]. According to the judicial
decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court, the task of the supervisory bodies is not,
however, to represent the interests of the groups/organizations delegating the respective
members, but rather is to act as a trustee for the public interest and thus to prevent any
biased interference and biased programming and to ensure that appropriate and fair account
is taken, within the overall programme, of all major political actors and groups.
Accordingly, the Federal Constitutional Court did not accord any socially relevant group including, for instance, a na tional minority - the right to be included in the composition of
supervisory bodies, and consequently did not regard non- inclusion as an act of
discrimination.
Some representatives or members of national minorities/language groups have been elected
to broadcasting bodies. A representative of Sydslesvigsk Forening (South Schleswig
Association), the chief cultural organization of the Danish minority, is a member of the
Assembly of Unabhängige Landesanstalt für den Rundfunk (ULR), the Schleswig-Holstein
supervisory authority for private broadcasters. Also, a female member of the Television
Board of Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television, or Channel II)
belongs to the Danish minority. In accordance with the Act on Private Broadcasting in
Saxony of 18 January 1996, a Sorbian representative nominated by the associations of the
Sorbs is a member of the Assembly of Sächsische Landesanstalt für privaten Rundfunk und
neue Medien [Saxon Land Institution for Private Broadcasting and New Media]. The Saxon
Landtag delegated a representative of the Sorbian umbrella organization Domowina to the
Broadcasting Board of Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr). In Brandenburg, too, a
representative of Domowina is a member of the Broadcasting Board of Ostdeutscher
Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) and of the Media Council of Landesmedienanstalt BerlinBrandenburg [Land Supervisory Authority for Private Broadcasters, Berlin- Brandenburg].
On account of the actual overall conditions regarding freedom of the press as guaranteed by
the Constitution, which provide for a large number of independent press products which, in
terms of political orientation or worldview/ideology, compete with each other, no
comparable legally regulated supervisory bodies exist in the print media sector.
The aforementioned freedoms may, as a matter of principle, also be exercised by the language groups in their respective language.
Like in the case of press products, creation of one's own media in the field of broadcasting
(sound radio and television broadcasting) depends on the size of the protected group and its
economic capacity. Where creation of own broadcasting media is not expedient or not
feasible, "Open Cha nnels" are usually available. These are used for local and regional
dissemination of non-commercial broadcasting items. In this way, individuals, social
groups, organizations, associations, unions and institutions can, independently and on their
own responsibility, produce broadcasting contributions and have them aired. These
contributions must conform to the general programming principles, must not contain any
commercial advertisements, must be on a non-profit basis and must not be provided for
remuneration. So far, no definitive findings are available as regards the extent to which
these "Open Channels" are used by the language groups.

49

Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
1. Promotion of measures required to cultivate and further develop the culture of members
of the language groups concerned and to preserve their protected languages and identity
is accomplished in Germany through the law in force and the promotional activities of
public authorities.
According to the distribution of responsibilities within the federal system of Germa ny,
cultural promotion is, on principle, subject to the Länder's autonomy in cultural matters.
Within the framework of local self- government under the Statutes enacted by the
Länder concerning the organization and powers of local governments [Local Authority
Statutes], e.g. Section 10, para. 2, of the Local Authority Code of Baden-Wurttemberg
Land, local authorities are called upon to promote the common weal of their inhabitants
through the citizenry's self- management. This also covers the requirement for attending
to the social and cultural needs of the inhabitants. Included in this are the needs of those
inhabitants who are members of the language groups protected under the Charter
because the definition of "inhabitant" leaves the person's nationality, la nguage, cultural
heritage, and religion out of consideration.
2. Of particular significance to the members of these language groups are the right to free
development of personality, as guaranteed by Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law, which
inter alia leaves the use of the relevant language, maintenance of the relevant
autonomous culture, and preservation of the ethnic identity to each individual; and
Article 4, paras. 1 and 2, of the Basic Law, which guarantee freedom of faith,
conscience, and to profess a religious or philosophical creed, as well as the undisturbed
practice of religion.
To create the conditions for focused governmental promotion of the culture and thus of
the languages concerned, the State has established bodies in which regular exchanges
can take place between the political community, public administration and minorities so
that the needs of the language groups will be taken account of in governmental
promotion. Also, functional areas have been established in public administration, which
are in constant touch with the minorities and have direct responsibility for protection
and promotion. When establishing this infrastructure, account had to be taken of the
different needs of the groups concerned, and of the capabilities available on the
government side.
The language groups in Germany vary in terms of their regional distribution, their
language proficiency, the infrastructure of cultural institutions and associations
established and maintained by the groups themselves, and their respective concepts for
the maintenance of their cultural and linguistic identity. In instances, this even applies
within a given particular language group which is represented by various organizations
with different objectives. Also, the respective situation, together with the historic
development, has - in conjunction with the varying financial resources of the Länder,
and taking account of the respective number of the members of national minorities and
ethnic groups in a Land - had an influence on governmental promotion policies.
Accordingly, the reports on the obligations entered into with regard to the various
languages are of varying length and detail.

50

Article 13
Economic and Social Life
In Germany, freedom to use one's own language - in private and in public - is ensured by
Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law, which guarantees the right to the free development of
one's personality. This freedom is also ensured in the context of the freedoms of expression,
of the press and of broadcasting [reporting by means of broadcasts] as guaranteed under
Article 5, para. 1, of the Basic Law.
In addition to the freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law for the entire territory of Germany,
Section 8 of the Act on the Specification of Rights of the Sorbs (Wends) in the Land of
Brandenburg (SWG) reaffirmed the right freely to use the Sorbian (Wendish) language.
Pursuant to the Saxon Constitution and Section 8 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free
State of Saxony and a number of other laws and ordinances, the Sorbs in the Free State of
Saxony have the right to communicate, orally and in writing, in their language in private and
in public.
Use of the minority languages in public, also in the business sphere and social life, is largely
accepted by the German population. No reservations exist in this respect. Much wider use is
made of languages other than German by the large numbers of foreigners living in
Germany, and this fact does not raise any problems in society - leaving a few far-rightist
individuals out of consideration.

Article 14
Transfrontier Exchanges
The right to to establish and maintain contacts as part of transfrontier exchanges is one of
the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the Basic Law and is protected by Article 2, para.
1, of the Basic Law (general freedom of action; freedom to leave the country) and Article
11, para. 1, of the Basic Law (freedom of movement within the federal territory; freedom to
enter the country).
Reference is made to the detailed comments in Part B on Article 7, para. 1, sub-para. (e) [p.
30 above].

51

As of: 13 September 2000

Danish
Obligations regarding Danish1 have been accepted only by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein
since the Danish minority in the Federal Republic have their traditional settlement area only
in this Land.

Article 8
Education
As regards the school system in general it is to be noted that the Danish minority have the
right, in all of Schleswig- Holstein Land, to instruction in the Danish language (Declaration
by the Government of the Federal Repub lic of Germany of 29.3.1955 [Bonn Declaration]).
Article 8 of the Constitution of the Land of Schleswig-Holstein leaves it to the
parents/guardians to decide whether their children should attend a school of a national
minority. The pupils coming from the Danish minority are thus given the opportunity to
learn and use the Danish language. The details are regulated by the Schools Act.
(1)
With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory
in which such languages are used, according to the situation of each of
these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official
language(s) of the State:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Pre-School Education –
(a)

(i)
to make available pre-school education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii
above at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose
number is considered sufficient; or
(iv)
if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of pre-school education, to favour and/or encourage the
application of the measures referred to under i to iii above;

Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (a) (iv).
As part of pre-school education, Danish language offers exist in day-care centres in the
Schleswig region of Schleswig- Holstein Land.
Dansk Skoleforening for Sydslesvig [Dänischer Schulverein für Südschleswig - Danish
Schools Associa tion for South Schleswig] is the providing body for activities of the Danish
minority with regard to nursery schools. At present it operates 58 nursery schools and day1

a minority language; territorial scope: Land of Schleswig-Holstein

52

nurseries which are attended by some 1,800 children. It is already in nursery school that the
children are prepared for attendance of a Danish school. The majority of these children will
actually go on to a Danish school. These institutions have their own admission regulations.
The Danish Schools Association is supported with funds of the Land of Schleswig-Holstein.
Subsidies for the educators employed in day-care centres are granted under Section 25, para.
4, of the Children's Day-Care Centres Act.
There are also a number of German nursery schools offering the Danish language. Since
1998, Danish has been offered, as part of a Language Encounter Concept, in seven nursery
schools by Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutsches Schleswig [Working Group "German Schleswig
Region"], one of the four German Border Associations.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Primary Education –
(b)

(i)
to make available primary education in the relevant regional
or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of primary education in
the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within primary education, for the teaching of the
relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of the
curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose number
is considered sufficient;

Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (b) (iv).
Under Article 8, para. 4, of the Land Constitution, the parents/guardians decide whether
their children should attend a school of a national minority.
In the 1999/2000 school year, there are 47 primary schools or comprehensive schools,
Realschulen [secondary schools, with lower secondary grades (i.e. secondary education
stage I)] or secondary modern schools with a primary education section. The Danish schools
are subsidized with Land funds. As regards the payroll costs and material expenses of these
schools, the Danish Schools Association is paid by the Land, without verification of the
requirements, a contribut ion per pupil which corresponds to 100 per cent of the costs
incurred for a pupil at a comparable publicly maintained [general-education] school in the
preceding year.
At a number of publicly maintained schools, foreign language teaching has, within the
framework of a model project, been introduced already at the primary school level. At a
number of publicly maintained schools in the Schleswig region of the Land, Danish as a
foreign language is offered as an optional subject for the 3rd and 4th grades.

53

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Secondary Education –
(c)

(i)
to make available secondary education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of secondary education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within secondary education, for the teaching of
the relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of
the curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils who, or where appropriate whose families, so
wish in a number considered sufficient;

Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligations under sub-paragraph (c) (iii) and (iv).
In Schleswig-Holstein, publicly maintained schools of all types offer Danish as a foreign
language (10 primary schools, 11 secondary modern schools, 36 Realschulen, 8 Gymnasien
[grammar schools], 4 specialized Gymnasien [leading only to a single field of university
study], 2 comprehensive schools). This offer extends to both the language area of the Danish
minority and the Kreise of Ostholstein, Plön, Dithmarschen and the Hanseatic City of
Lübeck, which are outside this language area. In the 1997/98 school year, a total of some
3,900 pupils took part in Danish language instruction offered at publicly maintained schools.
In addition, the school system of the Danish minority comprises secondary modern schools,
Realschulen, one comprehensive school and one Gymnasium (in Flensburg). These schools
admit pupils after the 4th grade or after the "orientation stage" (5th and 6th grades); the course
of education is completed after the 9th or 10th grade for secondary modern schools, after the
10th grade for Realschulen and the comprehensive school, and after the 13th grade for the
Gymnasium. Apart from the compulsory major subject "German", taught at the native
language level, the teaching language generally is Danish. In the final-year classes and
courses, however, it is ensured that also technical terms, especially in the fields of
mathematics/natural sciences and economics, are taught in German so as to prepare pupils
sufficiently for their future vocational training, in the German language, in enterprises and at
university. Final examinations are recognized in both Germany and Denmark.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Technical and Vocational Education –
(iii) to provide, within technical and vocational education, for the
teaching of the relevant regional or minority languages as an
integral part of the curriculum; or
At (part-time) vocational schools, Danish is offered as one of the foreign languages, as part
of general-education courses. At the specialized Gymnasium, Danish is taught as an optional
foreign language.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - University and Other Higher Education –

54

(ii)
to provide facilities for the study of these languages as
university and higher education subjects; or
Danish is offered as a course of studies in Nordic philology at Kiel University (CAU Christian-Albrechts-Universität), and as a course of studies for the teaching profession, at
Flensburg University (UF - Universität Flensburg).
In addition, the Dansk Centralbibliotek for Sydslesvig (Dänische Zentralbibliothek für
Südschleswig - Central Library for South Schleswig) in Flensburg has a research unit which
prepares scholarly articles/essays on the Danish minority. The general public in the GermanDanish border region, and the Danish minority in particular, also make use of the research
findings of Danish institutions, e.g. of the Danish universities and especially of the Institut
für
Grenzregionsforschung
[Institute
for
Border
Region
Research]
in
Åbenrå/Aabenraa/Apenrade in Denmark.
At present, 79 teachers at publicly maintained schools are qualified to teach Danish.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Adult Education –
(ii)
to offer such languages as subjects of adult and continuing
education; or
(iii) if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of adult education, to favour and/or encourage the offering of
such languages as subjects of adult and continuing education;
Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligations under sub-paragraph (f) (ii) and (iii).
Danish language courses are offered by the adult education centres of Schleswig-Holstein
Land and by Jarplund Højskole, the Danish residential adult education college in South
Schleswig.
In 1997, 486 Danish language courses, covering 11,720 class hours and attended by 5,558
participants, were held at 99 adult education centres in Schleswig-Holstein Land. For adult
education among the Danish minority, 287 courses, covering 5,915 hours and attended by
2,952 participants, were held in 1998 in 39 places of the Schleswig region of the Land.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Teaching of the History and Culture Education –
(g)

to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

In Schleswig-Holstein, the curricula for primary education and the lower secondary grades
[secondary education stage I] - in addition to the curricula for Danish instruction, where
matters regarding the regional history, geography and civilization play an important role provide for a wide scope for dealing also with the problems of minorities. Thus, for
instance, the curriculum fo r the 8th grade covers the subjects "The German-Danish Conflict
over the Schleswig-Holstein Question, 1864" and "The Danes of North Slesvig in Imperial
Germany".

55

The materials mentioned below in the comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (h), have
been patterned closely on the subjects listed in the curricula, and consequently substantially
help to deal with the Danish language as well as with specific cultural aspects.
The undertakings entered into by Schleswig-Holstein ensure that also persons who do not
speak Danish have access to this language.
re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Basic and Further Training of Teachers –
(h)

to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those [provisions] of paragraphs a to g accepted by the
Party;

In Schleswig-Holstein, further and continuous training measures are offered for teachers.
These latter have a say in the selection of subjects. An adviser for Danish is available to
schools in matters of further and continuous training. Teachers of the Danish Schools
Association for South Schleswig can take part in follow-up and advanced training offered
by the Institut für Praxis und Theorie der Schule (IPTS - Institute for Practical and
Theoretical School Matters).
The following are examples of follow- up training courses:
1997 Aspects of Danish Instruction with Particular Reference to Types of Schools (4
half-days);
1998 The Schleswig/Sønderjylland [South Jutland = North Slesvig] Region in Our
Days and in the Past (2 days).
The teachers of the private schools of the Danish minority have been trained either in
Denmark or in Germany. Their in-service (follow- up) training is either in the hands of
institutions of the Danish minority or is provided by Danish institutions. In SchleswigHolstein, a course of studies in Danish is offered (for details, cf. the comments under para.
1, sub-para. (e) (ii) [p. 53 above]). The Danish private schools primarily use textbooks
published by Danish educational publishing companies, but also educational materials
developed by these schools themselves to take specific account of the situation and the
history of the Danish minority, as well as German textbooks. The development, entailed by
the Bonn/ Copenhagen Declarations of 1955, of transfrontier promotion of minorities on the
basis of the reciprocity principle has ensured that for the minorities on both sides of the
border - Danes in Germany, and Germans in Denmark - adequate opportunities exist for
teacher training and for access to textbooks.
With the specific aim of ensuring recruitment of teachers belonging to the Danish minority
who are able to teach all subjects included in the curriculum, Section 5, para. 3, of the
Federal Educational Grants Act (BAFöG) grants members of the Danish minority
unrestricted subsidized educational advancement for attending a training institution located
in Denmark if such training cannot be undergone in Germany. This applies, for instance, to
teacher training since, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the subjects included in the
curriculum are, as a rule, taught in the German - but not in the Danish - language.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (i) - Supervisory Bodies –

56

(i)

to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing
the teaching of regional or minority languages and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings which will be made public.

At primary schools, secondary modern schools and Realschulen, the Education Offices [supervisory school authorities] of the Kreise/kreisfreie Städte [county-type administrative
districts/non-district municipalities] are responsible for supervising the measures taken
there. For the Gymnasien, comprehensive schools and vocational schools, responsibility for
supervision lies with the Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Cultural Affairs.
Also as regards the schools of the Danish minority, legal supervision [i.e. supervision
limited to the question of legality of administrative activities] lies with the Ministry for
Education, Science, Re search and Cultural Affairs.

re: Art. 8, para. 2
(2)

With regard to education and in respect of territories other than
those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally
used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or
minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the
appropriate stages of education.

Danish, a minority language in Germany, is the national language of the Kingdom of
Denmark, the northerly neighbour of Schleswig-Holstein. Therefore, the need to learn this
language is felt not only among the Danish minority, but by the majority population as well.
To meet this need, Schleswig-Holstein Land offers courses in Danish as a foreign language
at publicly maintained schools of all types. Several of these schools are in the Holstein region of the Land - i.e. outside the language area [Schleswig region] of the Danish minority in the Kreise of Ostholstein, Plön and Dithmarschen, and in the Hanseatic City of Lübeck.
As regards colleges and universities, the obligation - in the sense of "undertake ... to allow" is met for the entire territory of the Federal Republic by virtue of Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law (autonomy of institutions of higher education* ).

Article 9
Judicial Authorities
(1)
The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which
the number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies
the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the
present paragraph is not considered by the judge to hamper the proper
administration of justice:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Civil Proceedings –
*

"(3) Art and scholarship, research, and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching ..."

57

(b)

in civil proceedings:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

With the proviso that documents and evidence drafted in a minority language must be
presented in a form obviating misunderstandings or errors with regard to their translation,
this obligation is met by the legal situation prevailing in Germany. Therefore, no special
measures have been taken.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Proceedings before Courts concerning Administrative Matters –
(c)

in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

With regard to this undertaking which has been entered into by Schleswig-Holstein, cf. the
comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iii), above.
As regards this branch of the judiciary, it must be pointed out that administrative courts are
obliged to conduct ex officio investigations and, where necessary and appropriate, will on
their own initiative rely on the services of interpreters. Thus, the members of the language
group suffer no prejud ice by using their language.

re: Art. 9, para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Validity of Legal Documents –
(2)

The Parties undertake:
(a)
not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within
the State solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority
language; or

Regarding this obligation entered into by Schleswig- Holstein, reference is made to the
comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (c) (iii), above.

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
(1)
Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the
measures specified below and according to the situation of each language,
the Parties undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) v - Submission of Documents –

58

(a)

(v)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
validly submit a document in these languages;

The legal basis for acceptance of this obligation is Section 82a, para. 2, of the Land
Administration Act. This discretionary regulation provides for the general possibility to
submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other documents in a foreign language, i.e. a
language other than the official language.
According to a non-representative survey carried out among subordinate agencies of the
Ministry of the Interior of Schleswig-Holstein Land, use is made of this possibility, inter
alia, by land survey offices [cadastral offices] and by the Land Statistical Office.
re: para. 4
(4)
With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the
following measures:

re: para. 4, sub-para. (c) - Appointment of Public Service Employees having a Knowledge
of a Regional or Minority Language (c)

compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to
be appointed in the territory in which that language is used.

With a view to implementing this obligation, an announcement to this effect was made at
the Personalreferentenkonferenz (PRK - Conference of Personnel Officers) on 24 June
1999. The PRK brings together the personnel officers of the supreme Land authorities at
regular meetings with the aim of co-ordinating and harmonizing the essential crossdepartmental decisions in the field of personnel management.
If a staff member within the Land Administration expresses a wish regarding such an
appointment, the scope for complying with the request will be examined. So far, however,
there have been no requests to this effect at the Land Government level.

re: para. 5

The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names
in the regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.
Cf. the detailed comments on Article 10 in Part C above [p. 44].

Article 11
Media
(1)
The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority
languages within the territories in which those languages are spoken,

59

according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public
authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role
in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:

60

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) ii - Broadcasting of Radio Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
As regards use of broadcasting media, a particular situation prevails in the settlement area of
the Danish minority in the northern part of Schleswig-Holstein Land. Since the settlement
area borders directly on Denmark, the members of this minority can receive the entire
broadcasting programme of the Kingdom of Denmark. Consequently, no special need for
developing their own broadcasting media has arisen so far. Nevertheless, the wish has been
expressed that Danish versions of news and information about the Schleswig region of the
Land be included in the [German] programmes.
In a letter of 29 September 1999, the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Land has
encouraged the station programme directors of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Zweites
Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television, or Channel II),
DeutschlandRadio, Radio Schleswig-Holstein, NORA (NordOstseeRAdio), delta radio and
POWER RADIO Nord to integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the features
determining the specificity of our Land" in their programmes; intens ification of first action
already taken in this respect would be welcomed. In the spirit of the Regional/Minority
Language Charter, the Minister-President urged that "further avenues should be explored for
integrating contributions in the minority languages and in the regio nal language Low
German into their programmes, as a service for the citizens and in support of this element of
the culture of Schleswig-Holstein".
In addition, the following provisions have been laid down:
Ÿ The broadcasting corporation under public law (Norddeutscher Rundfunk - NDR) has the
legal mandate to report on the cultural diversity and the special features of the respective
Land and to give its support to the protection of minorities.
Ÿ Adequate room must be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture
and language.
Ÿ Programming principles for private broadcasting: "programmes shall help to ... achieve
protection and promotion of minorities".
Ÿ Protected minorities have access to the media, and scope for participation, on the same
conditions as other groups of society. The provisions of the Land Broadcasting Act
promote programming diversity and the variety of broadcasters.
Ÿ The Land Broadcasting Act was amended in 1999. In future, the previous Assembly of
the supervisory authority Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR - the
Schleswig- Holstein Land broadcasting institution for private broadcasters) will be
replaced by a Media Council. Any socially relevant group, organization or association of
supraregional stand ing is entitled to make nominations for the election of the Media
Council.
Ÿ In addition, the ULR operates two radio broadcasting "Open Channels" in SchleswigHolstein. Through these Open Channels, anybody who is not a broadcaster himself, can
disseminate his or her own contributions via radio broadcasting.

Facts and Examples:
Both in its Aktuell current affairs reporting and in the programmes of the Heimat, Kultur und
Wissenschaft Desk [Our Region, Culture, and Science] as part of newsfeature and magazine
programmes, the radio broadcasting programme of NDR 1 Welle Nord reports on events in
the German-Danish border region, on books, stage productions and exhibitions, on regional
co-operation, and on economic and political developments.
Radio Schleswig-Holstein (R.SH) disseminates a daily Danish- language news programme
on weekdays (17.55 o'clock) for the Schleswig region of the Land.
In addition, there are a TV model test project of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in Danish
and programmes of the Danish regional TV stations for Sønderjylland (South Jutland, or
North Slesvig) on subjects concerning the Danish minority.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) ii - Broadcasting of Television Programmes –
(ii)

to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a
regular basis;

Cf. the comments above on Article 11, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (ii).
On the first Wednesday of every month, a German-Danish programme of the regional TV
station Nord3-Regionalfernsehen of Landesfunkhaus Schleswig-Holstein is dedicated to the
Danish language. The German-Danish border region magazine Hier Her is produced in cooperation with Danish colleagues and covers bilingual reporting on current affairs. Since
January 1997, this programme has been on the air between 18.35 and 18.45 o'clock in the
area of TV Syd and Nord3, i.e. on the Danish side in the Ämter [local authority unions] of
Sønderjylland, Ribe and Vejle, and on the German side throughout Schleswig- Holstein. As
of January 2000, co-operation has been extended to the Danish TV station East, thus
enlarging the transmission area. The programme serves as a model within the framework of
the European integration process. Taking a look across the border is to rouse interest in the
events in the neighbouring country and, at the same time, as a bilingual programme with
subtitling, to enhance language skills.
Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television/Channel II), via its
regional programmes, also airs broadcasts on the Danish minority on special occasions or
when events of particular importance occur.

62

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Audio and Audiovisual Works –
(d)

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of
audio and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

The programming principles embodied in the Land Broadcasting Act provide an indirect
incentive to public service broadcasting and to private broadcasting: the Act lays down that
the broadcasting programmes shall contribute, inter alia, to the protection and promotion of
minorities.
In addition, subsidies may be granted. The relevant provision reads as follows:
"The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide
financial support to non-profit organizations with cultural (...) aims, especially in the
audiovisual sector (...)."
"Additional support is provided by the Gesellschaft zur Förderung audiovisueller Werke
in Schleswig-Holstein mbH (MSH - Limited Liability Company for the Promotion of
Audiovisual Works in Schleswig-Holstein). MSH obtains funds from the NDR
broadcasting corporation and from ULR [the Schleswig-Holstein supervisory authority
for private broadcasters]. These funds are used (...) for the promotion of commissioned
productions and coproductions in the cinema sector, television and sound broadcasting,
which are made by producers who are native to, or resident in, Schleswig-Holstein."
Legal Bases:
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 24, para. 3, Section 53, para. 2,
Section 73, para. 2.
Otherwise, it is left to the Danish minority, on the basis of the cultural promotion by the
Land and of the principle of self- government, to decide on pertinent measures and to
implement these within the limits of the overall funds available.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) ii - Newspaper Articles –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper
articles in the regional or minority languages on a regular basis;
There is little scope for [state] action/influence on account of the freedom of the press
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
The Danish minority in the Schleswig region of the Land publishes the bilingual (German/
Danish) newspaper Flensborg Avis (with a circulation of some 6,600 copies). According to
a scientific analysis, this newspaper is read every day by 15,000 people in the Schleswig region of the Land.
A Press Service which is affiliated to Syslesvigsk Forening (SSV - South Schleswig
Association) supplies information, in German and Danish, about the Danish minority to the
media in Germany and Denmark. The SSV is also subsidized with funds of SchleswigHolstein Land.

63

In a letter of 29 September 1999 addressed, inter alia, to the Zeitungsverlegerverband
Schleswig-Holstein e.V. [Schleswig- Holstein Association of Newspaper Publishers, reg'd],
the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Land has encouraged the addressees to
integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the features determining the specificity
of our Land" in the ir publications; intensification of first action already taken in this respect
would be welcomed.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) ii - Financial Assistance for Audiovisual Productions –
(ii)
to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to
audiovisual productions in the regional or minority languages;
Direct financial assistance by the State is problematic, due to the freedom of broadcasting
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
Promotion may be provided in the following ways:
The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide
financial support to non-profit organizations with cultural aims, especially in the audiovisual
sector.
Additional support is provided by the Gesellschaft zur Förderung audiovisueller Werke in
Schleswig-Holstein mbH (MSH - Limited Liability Company for the Promotion of
Audiovisual Works in Schleswig-Holstein). MSH obtains funds from the NDR broadcasting
corporation and from ULR [the Schleswig- Holstein supervisory authority for private
broadcasters]. These funds are used for the promotion of commissioned productions and
coproductions in the cinema sector, television and sound broadcasting, which are made by
producers who are native to, or resident in, Schleswig-Holstein.
Legal Bases:
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 53, para. 2, Section 73, para. 2.

re: Art. 11, para. 2 - Freedom of Direct Reception of Broadcasts, and Freedom of
Expression –
(2)
The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language
used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and
not to oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in such a language. They further undertake to
ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise
of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for

64

preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
The retransmission of existing broadcast programmes over cable systems is regulated in the
Land Broadcasting Act. For instance, priority is given, in cable systems, to the "Open
Channels" and to the feed- in of locally available programmes, depending on the existing
technical capacity. In addition, the Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen
(ULR) decides on window programmes on the basis of diversity aspects. Thus, equality of
minority programmes is ensured.
The aforementioned obligation is included in Sections 48 seqq. of the Land Broadcasting
Act, thus implementing the provisions of the EU Television Directive.*
Equal treatment is covered, in particular, by Section 50, para. 1, 2nd sentence.
In the area of the Danish minority in the Schleswig region of the Land, it is possible to
receive radio and television broadcasts from the neighbouring country Denmark.
Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
(1)
With regard to cultural activities and facilities - especially libraries,
video libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres
and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular
forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including
inter alia the use of new technologies - the Parties undertake, within the
territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Access to Works Produced in Other Languages –
(c)

to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced
in other languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;

The institutions of the Danish minority - such as Sydslesvigsk Forening (SSF - South
Schleswig Assocation) and the Dansk Centralbibliotek (Danish Central Library) can rely on
promotional fund s provided by Schleswig-Holstein Land for translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling into, or in, the Danish language.

65

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Taking Account of the Regional or Minority Language in Cultural
Activities –
(d)

to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for
incorporating the knowledge and use of regional or minority
languages and cultures in the undertakings which they initiate or
for which they provide backing;

With the help of promotional funds provided by Schleswig-Holstein, the institutions of the
Danish minority and/or bodies appointed by them and responsible for the cultural autonomy
of the Danish minority ensure that the knowledge and use of the Danish language and
Danish culture are appropriately incorporated in their cultural activities.
The exhibits of many museums in the Schleswig region of the Land are inscribed in Danish.
The City of Flensburg, for instance, provided the information that it has received
promotional funds from the EU Interreg II Programme for the improvement of GermanDanish public sign-boards and information in the museum. Also, a Danish version of a
museum guidebook published in the German language is planned to appear in 2000. The
Flensburg Shipping Museum already has German and Danish inscriptions and signposts.
Other pertinent examples are to be found also in Nordfriesland Kreis (the Foundation-owned
museum Roter Haubarg; the Eiderstedt Region Museum of Local History and Culture in St.
Peter-Ording).

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Employment of Staff Proficient in the Language(s) Concerned –
(e)

to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organising or supporting cultural activities have at their disposal
staff who have a full command of the regional or minority language
concerned, as well as of the language(s) of the rest of the
population;

Activities regarding the Danish culture and language are, for the major part, offered by
Danish minority organizations within the framework of the cultural autonomy of the
national minorities in Germany, and in part are supported with public funds of SchleswigHolstein. These subsidies also include funds used for meeting payroll costs. The full-time
staff employed in the field of Danish cultural work speak Danish and German, some of them
also Low German. Subsidizing of this staff provides for implementation of this provision of
the Charter.
As regards employment of polyglot staff in general, cf. the comments in Part C on Article
10 [p. 44 above].

66

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Participation of Representatives of the Group Speaking the Given
Language in Cultural Activities –
(f) to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and planning
cultural activities;
Every two years, Schleswig- Holstein Land organizes Schleswig-Holstein-Tag [a day
dedicated to the special character of the Land] as a central cultural event. The organizations
of the Danish minority are also invited to participate in this event and to take part in
arranging and organizing it. As part of the World Exhibition EXPO 2000 [in Hanover],
Sydslesvigsk Forening [South Schleswig Association] is a partner in the project Kulturen,
Sprachen, Minderheiten: Die dänische Grenzregion - Beispiel einer Konfliktlösung
[Cultures, Languages, Minorities: The Danish Border Region - An Example of Conflict
Management]. Also within the framework of EXPO 2000, a total of more than twenty
Danish, German and Frisian libraries have jointly developed a one-week programme as part
of the regional EXPO events in order to give a picture of the library and cultural scene of the
region, which in this form is unique in Germany and Denmark, by organizing multifarious
activities varying locally and in terms of their contents. The Danish minority is also invited
and encouraged to take part in local cultural events, such as town festivals and town
anniversaries, in which different organizers co-operate. Thus, there are various activities in
which direct participation by representatives of the Danish language groups in the cultural
life of the Land is encouraged.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Creation of Archive Bodies –
(g)

to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or
publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;

The Dansk Centralbibliotek [Danish Central Library] and its affiliated institutions are
available for collecting, keeping copies of, or publishing works produced in the Danish
language, and for these purposes can rely also on promotional funds provided by SchleswigHolstein. Stage productions of works produced in Danish are organized and financed, also
with the use of promotional funds provided by Schleswig-Holstein, by Sydslesvigsk
Forening [South Schleswig Association] and its affiliated institutions and by action groups
of other associations. On these occasions, Danish state theatres and touring theatre
companies are invited to give guest performances. Also the Danish-language amateur
theatrical society Det lille Teater in Flensburg gives Danish performances.

re: Art. 12, para. 2
(2)
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow,
encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in
accordance with the preceding paragraph.

67

In Germany, cultural activities keeping within the framework of the law in force are not
subject to any permit procedure or restrictions. Thus, the above obligation is already
fulfilled by the system of law in the Federal Republic of Germany. More extensive
implementation of this obligation by encouraging or providing such activities will have to
be decided by the Länder on a case-by-case basis.
Also outside the Danish language area (in the Schleswig region of Schleswig-Holstein
Land), the offers of Danish cultural activities and facilities are left solely to the decisionmaking of the autonomous cultural providing bodies, especially of the organizations of the
Danish minority. Thanks to the broad definition of the specified purposes for which the
public promotional funds of Schleswig-Holstein may be used in the context of the cultural
work of the Danish minority, it is also possible to stage events outside the immediate language area.

re: Art. 12, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing
their cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the
cultures they reflect.
This obligation is to be implemented by making it possible, by means of state support, for
cultural groups of the Danish minority - e.g. choirs, orchestras, ensembles, the amateur
dramatic group - to give performances abroad where they present and represent the culture
and language of the Danish minority of German nationality - and thus part of cultural life in
Germany. A beginning has already been made, e.g. with the performance by a vo calist
ensemble of the Danish minority during Deutscher Tag ["German Day"] in
Tinglev/Denmark (with financial support provided from German public promotional funds
to the organizer of the event).
Article 13
Economic and Social Life
(1)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake
within the whole country:
(a)
to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or
limiting without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority
languages in documents relating to economic or social life,
particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
(b)
to prohibit the insertion - in internal regulations of companies and
private documents - of any clauses excluding or restricting the use
of regional or minority languages, at least between users of the same
language;
(c)
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;
The obligations under sub-paras. (a) and (c) have been accepted by the Land of SchleswigHolstein. They are in compliance with the established law of the Federal Republic of
Germany and thus are fulfilled nation-wide for all regional or minority languages. Pertinent

68

violations of the legal order have not become known. Therefore, no special measures had to
be taken by the Land.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Facilitating the Use of the Regional or Minority Language –
(d)

to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority
languages by means other than those specified in the above subparagraphs.

The majority of the members of the Danish minority use the Danish language in the private
sphere. But account must also be taken of the situation in mixed-nationality marriages where
German may prevail. Danish is predominantly spoken within the organizations of the
Danish minority. Constant use and promotion of the Danish language provide the basis for
all minority-related activities. Of particular importance for proficiency in the Danish
language are the Danish private schools, especially also for the children from mixednationality marriages.
There are many and various ways in which the State promotes the learning and use of
minority la nguages (cf. the comments on the various obligations). In particular, efforts are
encouraged among the general public to keep these languages alive by using them within the
family and in extra- familiar everyday-life situations. In this regard, the cultural value of the
minority languages for Germany's cultural life is particularly emphasized so that, on the
basis of the resultant self-esteem and self-assurance, the younger generation will be more
willing to adopt these languages and pass them on. On account of the structures established
for the administration of matters of their own concern, the users of Danish are provided with
the practical means for using their language also in an extra- familiar context.

re: Art. 13, para. 2
(2)

With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake,
in so far as the public authorities are competent, within the territory
in which the regional or minority languages are used, and as far as
this is reasonably possible:

re: para. 2, sub-para. (c) - Social Care Facilities –
(c)

to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement
homes and hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in
their own language persons using a regional or minority language
who are in need of care on grounds of ill-health, old age or for other
reasons;

Staff members speaking the Danish language are available in the specialized clinics of the
Land.
Also, it should be pointed out that direct nursing and other care of persons in need of
nursing and care is not a public-sector responsibility, but rather is mostly carried out by
private-sector and free non-profit institutions. Thus, for instance, only 8 % of the more than

69

1,000 approved nursing facilities in Schleswig- Holstein are provided by incorporated
public- law institutions. None of these facilities is provided directly by the Land. Therefore,
it is not possible to lay down any requirements to be met by the various providing bodies as
regards the use of the minority language Danish. However, the Ministries with responsibility
in this field have until now not been notified of any cases which might give reason to
require certain institutions to provide permanently for staff with knowledge of this language.
Anyhow, there are no language barriers regarding oral communication in the various regions
of the Land since the members of the Danish minority are bilingual.

Article 14
Transfrontier Exchanges
The Parties undertake:
re: sub-para. (a) - Agreements with Other States –
(a)

to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind
them with the States in which the same language is used in identical
or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude such agreements,
in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of the same
language in the States concerned in the fields of culture, education,
information, vocational training and permanent education;

With regard to Danish, this provision is complied with by the practical implementation of
the Bonn/Copenhagen Declarations of 1955 and the Framework Convention for the
Protection of National Minorities which has entered into force for the Federal Republic of
Germany and for the Kingdom of Denmark. Both countries and Schleswig- Holstein Land
fund activities for the benefit of the Danish minority, which promote the fields of culture,
education, information, vocational training and permanent education and increase the scope
for transborder contacts.

re: sub-para. (b) - Co-operation across Borders –
(b)

for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or
promote co-operation across borders, in particular between regional
or local authorities in whose territory the same language is used in
identical or similar form.

The Verband landwirtschaftlicher Vereine in Südschleswig e.V. (Fælleslandboforeningen
for Sydslesvig - Union of Agricultural Associations in South Schleswig, reg'd) in Harrislee
is an institution of the Danish minority in the Schleswig region of the Land. The Union
receives a subsidy for personnel costs from the Ministry for Rural Areas, Town and Country
Planning, Agriculture and Tourism. The Union is formed by local associations in various
parts of the Schleswig region, which are supported by advisers of the Union. Thus, the
Danish consultants serve as a link between farmers of the Danish minority in SchleswigHolstein and those in Denmark.

70

Also, Flensburg City and the Kreise of Schleswig-Flensburg and Nordfriesland, on the
German side, and Sønderjylland Amt [North Slesvig local authority union], on the Danish
side, are partners of the German-Danish Border Region Schleswig/Sønderjylland which was
established on 16 September 1997 by an agreement concluded between these territorial
authoritie s. The aim of that Agreement is to provide the basis for long-term and intensive
co-operation for enhancing the development of this overall region in a European context.
The priority activities also include education (training and permanent education, as well as
language instruction). In this field, the objective is to disseminate knowledge of the culture
of the respective neighbours, so as to overcome cultural barriers. On the German side,
transborder cultural projects and events are promoted jointly by the Kreise of Nordfriesland
and Schleswig-Flensburg and Flensburg City. Co-operation across borders involves the national minorities, especially the Danish minority in Germany and the German minority in
Denmark. Membership of the Regional Council, i.e. the organization's body with both consultative and co-ordinating functions, includes - on the German side - three representatives
of Sydslesvigsk Vælgerforening (SSV - South Schleswig Association of Voters).
In 2000, the Police Directorate of Schleswig-Holstein Nord, in conjunction with Denmark,
carries out a Further Training Project stretched out over three years. The Project is
subsidized with funds of the INTERREG II Programme. Promotion extends, inter alia, to
language courses and joint seminars on the culture and history of the two Länder.

71

As of: 13 September 2000

Sorbian
Obligations regarding the Sorbian language 2 have been accepted by the Land of Brandenburg and the Free State of Saxony where the Sorbs have their traditional settlement area.
Article 8
Education
As regards the school system in general, it should be noted that, in the settlement area of the
Sorbian people, the respective Constitution and the relevant laws of the two Länder
guarantee that children's day-care centres and schools may, on principle, be established by
voluntary providing bodies; this guarantee, of course, also applies to Sorbian (Wendish)
associations. In the Free State of Saxony, part of the 25 Sorbian and bilingual children's daycare centres existing in the settlement area are provided by local authorities, and part are
provided by Christlich-Soziales Bildungswerk Ostsachsen e.V. [Christian-Social
Educational Association for Eastern Saxony, reg'd], by Sorbischer Schulverein e.V. [Sorbian
Schools Association], the Catholic Church, Arbeiterwohlfahrt [Workers' Welfare
Association] and the German Red Cross (DRK). All other educational institutions of the
Sorbian-German settlement area in Saxony which offer instruction in the Sorbian language,
especially the schools, are State-provided. A similar structure exists in Brandenburg.
It may be assumed that only some 20,000 of the 60,000 Sorbs in the central settlement areas
have such a command of Sorbian that they can actively communicate in that language orally
and in writing. In terms of geography, the two groups are distributed unevenly. Nearly all of
those Sorbs having a very good knowledge of Sorbian live in the area of the schooling
district of the Sorbian schools, which have been in existence since the late 1940s, in the
Bautzen-Kamenz-Hoyerswerda region. In the other parts of Lusatia, only a small share of
the Sorbians - mostly of older age - have a good knowledge of Sorbian.
The Saxon Act on Children's Day-Care Institutions of 10 September 1993 and the
Children's Day-Care Centres Act of Brandenburg Land of 10 June 1992 form the legal basis
for the teaching and cultivation of the Sorbian language and culture at Sorbian and bilingual
day-care centres in the German-Sorbian area. The Schools Act for the Free State of Saxony
of 3 July 1991 guarantees the right of pupils to learn the Sorbian language and, at a number
of schools, the right to instruction in selected subjects, for all grades, in the Sorbian
language. Under the Schools Act of Brandenburg Land of 12 April 1996 (Section 4, para. 5,
2nd sentence), advancement of the knowledge and understanding of the Sorbian (Wendish)
culture is a special task of schools. In the settlement area of the Sorbs (Wends) pupils have
the right to learn Sorbian (Wendish) and, in specified subjects and for grades [age-groups]
to be determined, the right to be instructed in the Sorbian language.

para. 1
(1)
With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory
in which such languages are used, according to the situation of each of
these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official
language(s) of the State:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Pre-School Education –
(a)

(i)
to make available pre-school education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii
above at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose
number is considered sufficient; or

The Free State of Saxony has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (a) (iii).
In the Free State of Saxony, Sorbian-speaking and bilingual groups are set up in childrens'
day-care centres if the parents/guardians so wish. The providing body of the given
institution is responsible for implementing the requirements laid down with regard to
Sorbian and bilingual groups. In practice, this means that the existing good overall
conditions for Sorbian- language education in children's day-care centres are actually used to
the extent requested by the parents and supported by the providing body. The free decision
of the parents/guardians is in agreement with the constitutional rights of the Sorbian people.
In the Free State of Saxony there are at present (as of November 1999) 12 day-care centres
run under the WITAJ * Project and Sorbian day-care centres, 13 German-Sorbian day-care
centres, and 54 children's day-care centres which keep up the Sorbian culture and the Sorbs'
customs/folklore. Sorbischer Schulverein e.V. [Sorbian Schools Association] became the
voluntary providing body of the children's day-care centre of Sielow in Brandenburg Land
on 1 March 1998, and of the children's day-care centres in Dörgenhausen and in Rohne
(both in the Free State of Saxony) on 1 April 1999 and on 1 July 1999, respectively. In these
three children's day-care centres, 95 children from German-speaking or mixed- language
homes are at present being initiated into the Sorbian language within the framework of the
WITAJ model project. These three day-care centres employ 14 Sorbian-speaking
educators/teachers.
Christliches Soziales Bildungswerk Sachsen e.V. [Christian Social Educational Association
for Saxony, reg'd] is the providing body for 10 Sorbian and German-Sorbian children's daycare centres. These are attended by a total number of 654 children, of whom 266 are
grouped in 23 Sorbian units.

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Brandenburg.
Pre-school education in Brandenburg Land comes within the responsibility of local
government authorities. Under the Local Authorities Financing Act, local governments are
allocated funds to support, inter alia, institutions and measures designed for pre-school
education, e.g. children's homes or day nurseries. Under the pertinent laws, parents are
granted extensive participatory rights. Such rights are exercised, in particular, within the
Committee of Children's Day-Care Centres (Section 7 of the Children's Day-Care Centres
Act) which "decides on educational and organizational matters of the day-care centre,
especially on the pædagogical concept". This Committee provides a forum which grants
substantial rights regarding the conceptual design and pædagogical orientation of the
children's day-care centres also to Sorbian (Wendish) parents, with a view to focusing
educational work also on the cultivation and imparting of the Sorbian (Wendish) language
and culture.
In Cottbus-Sielow, the first pre-school institution has been established, with Sorbischer
Schulverein e.V. [Sorbian Schools Association, reg'd] as its providing body. This is an
establishment which previously was provided by the respective local authority. It has been
transferred to Sorbischer Schulverein; the latter also receives regular subsidies for the
maintenance of the establishment and for its staffing. In addition, Sorbischer Schulverein
has been offered additional support for separate activities for the further and advanced
training of the educators concerned.
In twelve children's day-care centres of Brandenburg Land, a priority activity is the
imparting of the Sorbian (Wendish) language and culture. In many other children's day-care
centres operated in the Spreewald area (Lübbenau Amt, Vetschau), the Sorbian (Wendish)
language is used as part of activities to maintain customs/folklore following the yearly cycle
of seasons and festivals. The tutoresses introduce the children to dances, songs and stories
and to picture books covering the same subjects in German and Sorbian (Wendish). Also,
these children get a first-hand experience of customs/folklore being kept up by their parents,
grandparents and relatives in the clubs and associations dedicated to these activities.
The Youth Welfare and Youth Service Office of Oberspreewald-Lausitz Landkreis plans to
take up the cultivation of the Sorbian (Wendish) language and culture as an introductory
approach to the subject of "Inter-Cultural Education in Children's Day-Care Centres".

1. Brandenburg
At the primary schools in the traditional settlement area of the Sorbs (Wends), Low Sorbian
(Wendish) is offered as a regular subject. At present, some 1,000 pupils at 23 primary
schools avail the mselves of this offer. The primary schools make efforts to achieve a
particular Sorbian profile.
Participation in Sorbian (Wendish) classes has much increased over the past few years.
Also, the number of participants in Sorbian (Wendish) classes, as a percentage of the total
number of pupils, has increased substantially because, in the course of the past three years,
the number of participants in Sorbian (Wendish) classes has increased while the number of
pupils attending a primary school has dropped. The same goes for secondary education
within the meaning of para. 1, sub-para. (c), below.
The Education Offices of the kreisfreie Stadt [county borough type authority; non-district
municipality] of Cottbus and the Landkreise of Dahme-Spreewald, Oberspreewald-Lausitz
and Spree-Neisse have been repeatedly informed in recent years, last by the Circular of the
Ministry for Education, Youth and Sports of 14 June 1996, that - for the right to learn the
Sorbian (Wendish) language to be exercised - the choices existing in this respect must, in an
appropriate form, be brought to the parents' knowledge at the time of their children's
enrolment in an elementary school or at the time of their transfer to another school. A
survey carried out at the aforementioned Education Offices has shown that the requirements
for exercising the right to take part in Sorbian (Wendish) classes are met. The increase in the
number of pupils also shows that parents increasingly make use of this right.
2. Free State of Saxony
Sorbian is taught as the native language, as a secondary language and as a foreign language
(secondary language: mainly for pupils from bilingual families or from a bilingual setting;
foreign language: mainly for pupils from German-speaking families or from a Germanspeaking setting in the Sorbian settlement area), and as an encounter language (or basiccommunication language, or contact language). As a mother tongue, Sorbian is taught at six
Sorbian elementary schools, of which two are in Bautzen Landkreis, and four in Kamenz
Landkreis.
At four Sorbian primary schools, Sorbian is taught as a secondary language during the
1999/2000 school year. Another 29 elementary schools in the area covered by the Bautzen
Regional Education Office offer Sorbian as a secondary language or as a foreign language.
Sorbian also is one of a choice of seven encounter languages (in the 3rd and 4th grades, the
encounter language covering one hour per week is a compulsory subject at primary schools).
A survey conducted during the 1995/1996 school year on the pædagogic profiles of primary
schools showed that the Sorbian schools - but other primary schools as well - pay particular
attention to the cultivation of the Sorbian language and culture. Also in many other primary
schools in the German-Sorbian region, the Sorbs' customs and folklore are integrated into
school life.

families, so wish in a number considered sufficient;

The Land of Brandenburg and the Free State of Saxony have accepted the obligation under
sub-paragraph (c) (iv).
1. Brandenburg
At secondary schools, some 500 pupils at present receive instruction in Lower Sorbian. For
the major part, this instruction is given as a replacement for the second foreign language; in
some cases, however, it is also offered in addition to the foreign languages forming part of
the regular curric ulum. Three schools also open these Lower Sorbian language classes to
pupils of other schools, whose parents wish their children to take part in such instruction.
At one school, Niedersorbisches Gymnasium [Lower Sorbian grammar school] in Cottbus,
instruction in Lower Sorbian is mandatory. Pupils not wishing to take part in Lower Sorbian
instruction have to leave this school and transfer to another secondary-education school.
2. Free State of Saxony
In the 1999/2000 school year, the Landkreise [county-type administrative districts] of
Kamenz and Bautzen have six Sorbian secondary technical schools. Four of these schools
have classes with both Sorbian as a mother tongue and Sorbian as a secondary language. In
addition, Sorbian is offered as a foreign language at six other secondary technical schools
within the area of the Bautzen Regional Education Office. Instruction is based on the current
curricula for Saxon secondary technical schools. For pupils for whom Sorbian is the native
tongue, instruction is given in the Sorbian language, with the exception of the following
subjects: German, mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology (from the 7th grade
onwards). All other pupils are taught in German. The rules laid down by the Saxon State
Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs with regard to instruction at Sorbian and other
schools in the German-Sorbian region, and the specifications regarding the respective
approved subject hours have resulted in an increased requirement for teachers covering
these subject hours at the Sorbian secondary technical schools.
Like other grammar schools in the Free State of Saxony, Sorbisches Gymnasium of Bautzen
provides general education which is the prerequisite for entry to higher education
[entitlement to university entrance]. This is the only Gymnasium where pupils are offered
in-depth linguistic and literary educ ation in the Upper Sorbian language. The Saxon State
Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs ge nerally allows Sorbian pupils to enrol in a
special achievement course [advanced course] in their mother tongue and to take the written
Abitur [grammar-school graduation] exams in this language. The approval for the
introduction, from the 1996/1997 school year onwards, of the advanced-course subject

76

combination Sorbian/natural sciences (biology or chemistry or physics) for pupils speaking
Sorbian as their mother tongue offers pupils a significant widening of choices and, at the
same time, may be seen as a contribution towards promoting the Sorbian language and
culture. Bilingualism is a particularly decisive factor of school life at Sorbisches
Gymnasium; all pupils learn Sorbian either as their native language or as a secondary
language.
In addition to Sorbisches Gymnasium, two grammar schools in Saxony, within the area of
the Bautzen Regional Education Office, offer language instruction in Sorbian as a foreign
language.
Overall, Sorbian instruction, including Sorbian as an encounter language, is given, in the
1999/2000 school year, at 50 schools in Saxony and is attended by some 3500 pupils of
whom about 1250 speak Sorbian as their mother tongue. At Sorbian schools, Sorbian is a
compulsory subject. At other schools, participation in Sorbian language lessons is a free
decision to be made by the pupils' parents. The basis for this decision - especially in cases
where parents still have their doubts - is provided in the day-care centres or, at the latest, at
the time of enrolment in an elementary school. In this respect, it is important that nurseryschool teachers, educators and teachers constantly underline the value of the Sorbian
language and culture and encourage parents and pupils to devote themselves to these
traditional values.

Leipzig University offers a course of Sorbian Studies (Sorabistics) for a Master's degree or
for the teaching profession.
In the Free State of Saxony and in Brandenburg Land, the study of the Sorbian language and
culture also is in the hands of Sorbisches Institut [Sorbian Institute]. The research priorities
of the Sorbian Institute are linguistics, empirical cultural research, folklore, and the cultural
and social history of the Sorbian people. At present, the Institute has a staff of 35, of whom
21 are scholars. The Institute is financed with public funds provided through Stiftung für das
sorbische Volk (Foundation for the Serbian People).
In the field of linguistics, the Institute, after having completed the work on the 15-volume
"Sorbian Linguistic Atlas", focuses its research on the [multinationa l] Slav linguistic atlas.
Those involved in the related practical work have a great demand for manuals, dictionaries
and textbooks which the Institute develops on a periodical basis. Sorbisches Institut also has
at its disposal the Sorbische Zentralbibliothek (Sorbian Central Library) with some 80,000
volumes (books and journals), and Sorbisches Kulturarchiv (Sorbian Cultural Archives)
with about 300 running metres of records and files. Like a national library, the Sorbian
Central Library collects all Sorbian and Sorabistic editions and continuously publishes a
"Sorbian Bibliography". The Archives preserve and explore the essential documents of
Sorbian cultural development from more than four centuries. Sorbisches Institut combines
its scholarly studies with the support of specific projects in the field of cultural and language
promotion. Thus, on the basis of sociolinguistic studies, concepts are developed for focused
promotion of the Lower Sorbian language.
Other scholarly studies carried out by the Institute deal with everyday life and the living
conditions of the Sorbs in the course of their history and at present, their religiousness, their
family relations, changes regarding their identity, or bilingual and bicultural ways of life.
Studies on literature, music, plastic and graphic arts, theatre and cultural relations with other
civilizations and cultural areas elucidate further priority aspects of Sorbian life. The head
office of the Sorbian Institute is in Bautzen in Saxony, with a branch in Cottbus
(Brandenburg). This branch, which focuses on linguistics, is the first scholarly institution to
deal specifically with the Sorbs of Lower Lusatia.

The Schule für niedersorbische Sprache und Kultur (School for the Lower Sorbian/Wendish
Language and Culture) in Cottbus, which is part of the Cottbus Adult Education Centre,
offers a wide range of cour ses in the Lower Sorbian language and culture. These are both
continuing education courses for adults and courses for teachers who teach Lower Sorbian
in the traditional settlement area of the Sorbian (Wendish) people, or wish to acquire
knowledge of the Lower Sorbian language and culture for teaching another subject.

1. Brandenburg
Section 4 of the School Act of Brandenburg Land lays down that the ability and readiness of
pupils should be enhanced to understand their own culture as well as other cultures, with
particular refe rence to the Sorbian culture.
In order to be able to take adequate account of the history and culture of the Sorbs at schools
in the traditional setlement area of the Sorbian people, as well as at schools out side that area,
teachers are offered courses regarding the history and culture of the Sorbs by the Schule für
niedersorbische Sprache und Kultur (School for the Lower Sorbian/Wendish Language and
Culture) and by Arbeitsstelle Bildungsentwicklung Cottbus (ABC) [Cottbus Workshop for
Educational Development] which was established by the Ministry for Education, Youth and
Sports specifically for the Lower Sorbian subject matter. In addition, the framework
curricula of Brandenburg Land provide for the inclusion of the history and culture of the
Sorbs in a number of subjects (e.g. music, arts, politics, Lifestyle Choices-Moral
Philosophy-Study of Religion).
The materials mentioned below in the comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (h), have

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Basic and Further Training of Teachers –
(h)

to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those [provisions] of paragraphs a to g accepted by the
Party;

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg. Since teacher training is pursued across Land borders, the implementation
measures are presented here for both of the Länder in order to avoid repetition.
In the settlement area of the Sorbs (Free State of Saxony and Brandenburg Land), teaching
of and in the Sorbian languages (Upper Sorbian and Lower Sorbian/Wendish) is given at
publicly maintained schools. Basic training of Sorbian teachers in Sorbian Studies
(Sorabistics) - for the teaching profe ssion - is offered by Leipzig University (in Saxony).
This University trains the majority of Sorbian teachers. The Ministry for Education, Youth
and Sports of Brandenburg Land has, jointly with Potsdam University (Institute for the
Study of Slavic Languages and Literatures, and Centre for Further Education), prepared an
extension course of studies regarding Sorbian (Wendish) for lower secondary grades (i.e.
secondary education stage I of German schools), which started on 1 April 1998. The aim is
to qualify some 20 teachers for teaching Sorbian (Wendish) at schools. A continuation
course of studies for acquiring teaching qualification for secondary education stage II is in
preparation. For the subject of Sorbian (Wendish), framework plans have been developed
for primary education, for secondary education stage I, and for the upper secondary grades
of a Gymnasium [grammar school]. These plans were established by teachers from
Brandenburg Land in co-operation with a linguist from Magdeburg University. The
Commission's work was co-ordinated by the Land Institute for Pædagogics and by
Arbeitsstelle Bildungsentwicklung Cottbus (ABC - Cottbus Workshop for Educational
Development).
The offers regarding central and regional follow- up/in-service training of Sorbian teachers
are essentially demand-oriented at present. The Saxon Akademie für Lehrerfortbildung
[teacher follow- up training college], for instance, during the study course period September
1998 - February 1999, offered a course on the subject "Methodische Anregung zur
Textarbeit im Sorbischunterricht" ["Methodology for Working with Texts in Sorbian
Classes"] for teaching posts at Realschulen [secondary schools, with lower secondary grades
(i.e. secondary education stage I)] and Gymnasien [grammar schools; schools with upper
secondary grades], and a course entitled "Unterwegs nach Europa - Mehrsprachigkeit statt
Einsprachigkeit" ["On our way to Europe - Polyglotism instead of unilingualism"]. In
addition, regional training offers exist for teachers who teach Sorbian as a foreign language
or as the native language, for instance "Methodische Anregungen zur Textarbeit im

80

Sorbischunterricht für Lehrer, die Sorbisch als Fremdsprache unterrichten" ["Methodology
for Working with Texts in Sorbian Classes, for Teachers who teach Sorbian as a Foreign
Language"]. Teachers who teach other subjects in the Sorbian language, can take part in
centrally or regionally organized follow-up training in sub ject-specific and multidisciplinary
studies. The regional training activities offered so far also comprise follow-up training
which is advertised and carried out in the Sorbian language. The catalogue of training
offered by the Bautzen Regional Education Office covers two courses for teachers of
Sorbian primary schools and one course for teachers of Sorbian secondary technical schools,
which are also advertised and held in the Sorbian language. For the entire spectrum of
school types, a training course is offered on the subject of "Sorbian: Reactivation of the
Language / In-Class Educational Materials / Textbooks".
In May 1992, the independently managed Arbeitsstelle Bildungsentwicklung Cottbus (ABC)
[Cottbus Workshop for Educational Development] was established at Niedersorbisches
Gymnasium [Lower Sorbian grammar school] in Cottbus (Brandenburg). As regards followup training of Sorbian (Wendish) la nguage teachers and of educators teaching other subjects
at Niedersorbisches Gymnasium, ABC has the following tasks:
- Sorabistic, including reactivating and advanced, linguistic follow-up training;
- subject-specific didactical follow- up training of teachers;
- follow-up training in the fields of culture, history, customs/folklore and the policy
regarding minorities for Sorbian (Wendish) teachers and interested teachers for other
school subjects.
For follow-up training of teachers, funds are available to Arbeitsstelle Bildungsentwicklung
Cottbus (ABC). In addition, a teachers' instructor specially qualified for giving follow-up
training is employed for the follow-up training of teachers. ABC and the teachers' instruc tor,
in co-ordination with the Brandenburg Land Institute for Pædagogics, independently
develop the pertinent follow-up training offers. The courses are usually held once or twice
per month and, in compact form, at the start of the summer holidays and occasionally during
the spring vacation. In addition, training is offered for teachers for other school subjects in
co-operation with the Schule für Niedersorbische Sprache und Kultur [School for Lower
Sorbian Language and Culture] which is part of the Cottbus Adult Education Centre.

1. Brandenburg
At the Ministry for Education, Youth and Sports, a section has been established (Section for
International Matters and Matters of the Sorbs) where an Assistant Head of Section and an
executive officer supervise the introduction and further development of Lower Sorbian
instruction. In addition, the four Education Offices in the traditional settlement area of the
Sorbian people in Brandenburg Land have school supervisory officers whose main task is to
supervise Lower Sorbian instruction.

81

The Land Government has informed the Parliament of the implementation measures in
response to a parliamentary question put to the Government.
2. Free State of Saxony
The Saxon State Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs is responsible for school
matters of the Sorbs. In addition, the interests of the Sorbian and German/Sorbian schools in
the Sorbian settlement area of the Free State of Saxony are dealt with by a Commissioned
Inspector of Schools of the Bautzen Regional Schools Office.
A report on the situation of the Sorbian people in the Free State of Saxony is submitted
pursuant to Section 7 of the Saxon Sorbs Act by the Saxon State Government to the Saxon
Landtag [Land Diet] at least once per legislative period. The report is also published for
release to the general public.

re: Art. 8, para. 2
(2)

With regard to education and in respect of territories other than
those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally
used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or
minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the
appropriate stages of education.

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony.
Instruction in the Sorbian language outside the traditional settlement area of the Sorbian
people in Upper Lusatia in the North-Eastern part of the Free State of Saxony is offered by
Sorbisches Kultur- und Informationszentrum [Sorbian Cultural and Information Centre] in
Berlin. The Centre holds Sorbian courses which are subsidized by the Foundation for the
Sorbian People. At the Sorbian Language and Culture Institute of Leipzig University, all
courses (other than beginners' courses) are held in Sorbian. In order to enable Sorbian
students to stay in contact with the Sorbian language and culture also outside their
settlement area, accommodation in Sorbian student hostels is offered in Dresden, Leipzig
and Berlin. More extensive implementation of this obligation is not envisaged at present, in
view of the small number of members of the language groups living outside the settlement
area.
As regards colleges and universities, the obligation - in the sense of "undertake ... to allow" is met for the entire territory of the Federal Republic by virtue of Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law (autonomy of institutions of higher education* ).

Judicial Authorities
(1)
The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which
the number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies
the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the
present paragraph is not considered by the judge to hamper the proper
administration of justice:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Criminal Proceedings –
(a)

in criminal proceedings:
(ii)
to guarantee the accused the right to use his/her regional or
minority language; and/or
(iii) to provide that requests and evidence, whether written or
oral, shall not be considered inadmissible solely because they are
formulated in a regional or minority language; and/or

These obligations have been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg. The implementation measures are presented here for both of these Länder.
Specia l provisions governing use in court with regard to the Sorbian language are laid down
in the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic
Republic on the Establishment of German Unity (Unification Treaty) of 31 August 1990,
which explicitly provides that the Sorbs shall - continue to - have the right to speak Sorbian
in court in their home Kreise and that this right shall remain unaffected by Section 184 of
the Organisation of the Courts Act (Annex - I Chapter III, Subject Area A, Section III 1.r of
the Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990). This provision is implemented in the Länder of
Saxony and Brandenburg.
The signs indicating the courts in the traditional settlement area [Lower Lusatia] of the
Sorbian (Wendish) people in Brandenburg are bilingual. If Sorbians wish to litigate in their
own language - which they are entitled to do under the Unification Treaty and the Land
Constitution - translators are called in. So far, however, no case has become known where a
Sorb availed him/herself of this right in a court of Brandenburg Land.
In the Sorbian settlement area [Upper Lusatia] of the Free State of Saxony, all courts have
bilingual signs. In addition, the Saxon Higher Administrative Court also uses GermanSorbian letterhead stationery. In every court in the Sorbian settlement area of the Free State
of Saxony, at least one staff member has a command of the Sorbian language so that citizens
can also state their case in Sorbian. This right is actually being made use of.
The costs incurred for any required services of interpreters or translators are part of the
regular costs of the proceedings and thus are not charged as an extra item.

if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

The obligations under sub-paragraph (b) (ii) and (iii) have been accepted by the Free State
of Saxony; also, the obligation under (iii) has been adopted by Brandenburg Land.

regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

persons concerned.

The obligations under sub-paragraph (c) (ii) and (iii) and under sub-paragraph (d) have been
explicitly accepted by the Free State of Saxony; also, the obligation under sub-paragraph (c)
(iii) has been adopted by Brandenburg Land.
See also the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (a), above.
As regards this branch of the judiciary, it must be pointed out that administrative courts are
obliged to conduct ex officio investigations and, where necessary and appropriate, will on
their own initiative rely on the services of interpreters. Thus, the members of the language
group suffer no prejudice by the use of their language.

not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within
the State solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority
language; or

Implementation of this obligation - which has been accepted by Free State of Saxony and by
Brandenburg Land - ensues from the comments above on Article 8 [pp. 69 seqq.].
For the Land of Brandenburg, the following should be pointed out:
Under Section 23, para. 5, of the Administrative Procedure Act of Brandenburg Land, a
legal document is not invalid at law solely because it is drafted in the Sorbian language.
Rather, a translation must be made of it.
It is not known how many legal documents drafted in Lower Sorbian exist in Brandenburg
and in what form they have so far been used in legal relations. However, no case has
become known where such documents were used in relations with judicial authorities.

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
(1)
Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the
measures specified below and according to the situation of each language,
the Parties undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:
re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Applications, and Submission of Documents –
(a)

(iv)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
submit oral or written applications in these languages; or
(v)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
validly submit a document in these languages;

The obligations under sub-paragraph (a) (iv) and (v) have been accepted by the Free State of
Saxony and by the Land of Brandenburg.
In the German-Sorbian areas, both German and the Sorbian language are admitted in
relations with the authorities and administrations of the Land and local governments. This
right is expressly stipulated in Sections 9 and 11 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free
State of Saxony (Saxon Sorbs Act) of 20 January 1999 and in Section 23 of the
Administrative Procedure Act of Brandenburg Land. These provisions provide for the
general possibility to submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other documents in the
Sorbian language.
The translation of such applications etc. into the German language is taken care of by the
authority concerned. No costs for translations are charged to the citizen.

85

It is not known to what extent use is made of the facilities granted under this provision. In
this regard, no statistical data are collected.

re: para. 2
(2)

In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory
the number of residents who are users of regional or minority
languages is such as to justify the measures specified below, the
Parties undertake to allow and/or encourage:

re: para. 2, sub-paras. (a) and (b) - Use of a Regional or Minority Language, and Applications to Local and Regional Authorities –
(a)
the use of regional or minority languages within the
framework of the regional or local authority;
(b)
the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to
submit oral or written applications in these languages;
The obligations under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) have been accepted by the Free State of
Saxony; also, the obligation under sub-paragraph (b) has been entered into by Brandenburg
Land.
In this respect, cf. the comments above on paragraph 1. Also, it should be noted that within
local administrations, the staff and directors of various sections speak the Sorbian language.
Some of them have direct responsibility for Sorbian matters. Within the local authorities of
the traditional settlement area of the Sorbian (Wendish) people in Brandenburg Land, most
public notices are bilingual; for official letters of such authorities, bilingual letterhead
stationery is used.
In the Sorbian communities, or communities with a Sorbian majority, in the Free State of
Saxony, the Sorbian language prevails in public life. This also goes for administrative
authorities and meetings of local/municipal councils. At the same time it is ensured, e.g. by
bilingual notices on the bulletin board, that also citizens who only speak German are
included in community life. In these places, in particular, civil marriages are increasingly
contracted in the Sorbian language.
In all places where the Sorbs form the (mostly small) minority within the local population,
only hesitant use is made of the legal and practical scope for using the Sorbian language in
relations with the administration.
Even where sufficient numbers of staff members of Kreis and local authorities have
proficiency in the Sorbian language, these capabilities are seldom used by the Sorbian
population. As a rule, Sorbian citizens prefer to use the German language in their relations
with administrative authorities because they thus want to preclude any misunderstandings in
the administration's assessment of the matter put before it. To give some examples:
In the city of Cottbus, the correspondence between the Commissioner for Sorbian (Wendish)
Matters and the Sorbian institutions and associations as well as citizens belonging to the
Sorbian people takes place, for the major part, in the Lower Sorbian language. Although this

86

provides the basis for handling such petitions in Sorbian, no citizen has so far made a
written submission in the Lower Sorbian language to the municipal authorities.
In Oberspreewald-Lausitz Landkreis, the Lower Sorbian language is very seldom used in
relations with administrative authorities although the actual conditions for such use exist,
since usually the staff of the authorities concerned have a command of the Lower Sorbian
language. For the Landkreise of Spree-Neisse and Dahme-Spreewald, no cases have been
reported where citizens contacted administrative authorities in the Lower Sorbian language.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (g) - Place- names –
(g)
the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the
name in the official language(s), of traditional and correct forms of
place-names in regional or minority languages.
This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg.
In the Sorbian settlement area, there are - for the major part - bilingual signs for places,
towns, Landkreise [rural county-type administrative districts], etc. and for public buildings,
institutions, streets, lanes and roads, squares and bridges. This is explicitly laid down in
Section 10 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free State of Saxony (Saxon Sorbs Act) and
in Section 11 of the Act to regulate the substance of the Sorbs' (Wends') rights in the Land
of Brandenburg (Act on the Specification of the Rights of the Sorbs (Wends)).
The requirement for bilingual inscriptions, as laid down in Section 11 of the Act to regulate
the substance of the Sorbs' (Wends') rights in the Land of Brandenburg, also covers the
arrangement, design and posting of traffic signs/road signs pursuant to the German Road
Traffic Regulations. Where local authorities, as public construction agencies, are responsible
for putting up traffic signs/road signs, such responsibility refers to Sign 432 (indicating
direction to destinations within built-up areas and to locations of considerable traffic
importance) and to Sign 437 (indicating road or street names).
Often the Sorbian/Wendish names of towns and villages are also used on the letterhead
stationery of the local authorities concerned.

re: Art. 10, para. 3
(3)
With regard to public services provided by the administrative
authorities or other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake,
within the territory in which regional or minority languages are used, in
accordance with the situation of each language and as far as this is
reasonably possible:

re: para. 3, sub-paras. (b) and (c) - Applications in a Regional or Minority Language with
regard to Public Services –

87

(b)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a
request and receive a reply in these languages; or
(c)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a
request in these languages.
The obligations under sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) have been assumed by the Free State of
Saxony and by the Land of Brandenburg.
Reference is made to the comments above on paras. 1 and 2.

re: Art. 10, para. 4
(4)
With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the
following measures:

re: para. 4, sub-para. (a) - Translation or Interpretation
(a)

translation or interpretation as may be required;

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Brandenburg.
In this regard, cf. the comments above on paragraph 1 [p. 81].
re: para. 4, sub-para. (c) - Appointment of Public Service Employees having a Knowledge
of a Regional or Minority Language –
(c)

compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to
be appointed in the territory in which that language is used.

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and the Land of
Brandenburg.
So far, this provision has not yet been implemented in the sense of introducing pertinent
Land legislation providing that public sector workers having a knowledge of the Sorbian/
Wendish language shall be appointed, at their request, in the traditional settlement area of
the Sorbian people. However, the Land Governme nt and Land Administration, within the
limits of what is possible, always strive to meet any wishes expressed by Land public
officials as regards their employment. Accordingly, no case has yet become known where a
public official having a command of the Sorbian/Wendish la nguage expressed the wish to
be appointed in the traditional settlement area of the Sorbian people, and where this wish
was not complied with.

re: Art. 10, para. 5
(5)
The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names
in the regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.

88

This obligation has been explicitly accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg. In this regard, cf. also the comments in Part C on Article 10 [pp. 44 seqq.
above].

Article 11
Media
(1)
The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority
languages within the territories in which those languages are spoken,
according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public
authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role
in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) ii - Broadcasting of Radio Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
In the traditional settlement areas of the Sorbian people in the Free State of Saxony and in
Brandenburg Land, public-service broadcasting has developed an extensive programme in
the two Sorbian languages. The programme is devoted, in particular, to the fields of information, culture and education. 'Culture' is understood in the largest sense of the word; this
thematic section also covers reports on traditions/folklore and on the life of societies and
associations, reviews of stage productions and of books, and talks with Sorbian authors and
other persons engaged in the cultural sector. In addition, there are news, commentaries,
topical reports, especially on current affairs in the region, and religious contributions. The
musical sector covers Sorbian folk songs, in particular, and ranges to modern Sorbian
popular songs and rock.
The following radio programmes are aired:

1. Brandenburg
Under Article 4 of the Act on Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg, Ostdeutscher Rundfunk
Brandenburg (ORB), like Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr), has to take account, in its
programme, of the cultural diversity of Brandenburg Land and of the Sorbian culture and
language.
From its Cottbus Studio, ORB on Mondays through Fridays broadcasts a daily 1-hour radio
programme in Lower Sorbian, with an additional 90- minutes programme on Sundays, so
that sound radio broadcasting alone produces 6 ½ hours per week in the Lower Sorbian
language. In addition, the mdr programme in the Upper Sorbian language is taken over. This
brings the total of sound broadcasting aired in the Sorbian language to 28 hours [per month].

89

2. Free State of Saxony
Under Section 6, para. 3, of the [Saxon] Act to implement the Agreement on Mitteldeutscher
Rundfunk (mdr) of 27 June 1991, broadcasts of the mdr must take account of the interests of
all segments of the population – including the minorities. With its Sorbisches Studio in
Bautzen, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr) broadcasts a daily radio programme in Upper
Sorbian on Mondays through Saturdays, for three hours during the early morning
programme, and on Sundays, around noon, for one and a half hours, and occasionally live
transmissions as well. In addit ion, a 1-hour youth programme, "Radio Satkula", has been
aired every Monday since April 1999; it covers news, reports, modern Sorbian and
international music, and other reporting items. It is developed and presented by Sorbian
youngsters. The programme is re-run on Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) the
following day. Leaving special broadcasts aside, this amounts to an airtime of 21.5 hours
per week in the Upper Sorbian language.
In addition, Landesfunkhaus Sachsen (Land Broadcasting Centre Saxony) of the mdr airs a
half- hour double-tone (German and Upper Sorbian) television programme at 20.15 hours
every four weeks on Wednesdays. Also, every Sunday, there is double-tone transmission
(German and Upper Sorbian) of the short children's programme "Sandman". These are not
programmes dealing with Sorbian subjects, but are translations of the regular programmes
into a Sorbian version. The mdr does not have a TeleWindow covering Sorbian subjects in
the Sorbian language.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) ii - Broadcasting of Television Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
1. Brandenburg
ORB (Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg) Television airs the only regular Sorbianlanguage programme in Germany, which is entitled "Luzyca - Sorbisches aus der Lausitz"
[Sorbian matters from Lusatia]. Since April 1992, a regular monthly air-time has been
assigned to this programme, namely every third Saturday of the month, at 13.30 hours.
There are re-runs on the respective subsequent Wednesday, at about 23.30 hours. This is a
30-minute magazine programme in Lower Sorbian, with German subtitling. The aim of this
magazine programme is to present the Sorbian language, culture, tradition, everyday life and
problems. The Sorbs' emotional ties with the homeland and their national self-assurance are
to be fostered. Examples of this are reports on traditions in the handicrafts and on folk arts
and crafts which in future might die out. Also, efforts are being made to prevent any
reduction in the younger generation's respect and esteem for the Sorbian language.
2. Free State of Saxony
Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr) has repeatedly been requested by the Saxon State
Government to start regular broadcasting of television programmes in the Sorbian language.
So far, it airs the double-tone (German/Sorbian) television programme at 20.15 hours every
four weeks on Wednesdays, and a dual-tone good- night programme for children (about 8
minutes) every second Sunday.

90

A particular deficit, however, is seen by the members of the Sorbian people in the fact that
mdr so far does not air any regular TV programmes on Sorbian issues and in the Sorbian
language. Within the scope provided under media law, the Land Government strives to
improve such programme offers.

91

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Audio and Audiovisual Works –
(d)

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of
audio and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg.
Special attention is given to the cultivation of Sorbian music and the study and revival of the
musical heritage. This is, in part, achieved by presenting a wide range of carefully selected
music in the radio programme. In addition, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr), in Saxony, and
Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) produce their own recordings since Sorbian
music is scarcely offered on the market. About 80 to 100 titles are recorded per year. This
production also comprises efforts to research the inventory of Sorbian folk songs, giving
suggestions and assistance to interpreters, groups and vocalist ensembles with regard to their
musical arrangements, promotion of talented Sorbian musicians, for instance by organizing
a yearly concert of talented young artists or tape-recording of musical events, and assistance
given by ORB in the publication of sound recording media.
A number of Sorbian film productions are offered on video-cassettes. Most of them are
children's movies (for the major part, adopted from Czech animated cartoons), videos for
schools, e.g. for history classes, and films about the Sorbs or Sorbian subjects. Most videos
are in Upper Sorbian; a few are also edited in Lower Sorbian; in most cases, information
films are provided as multilingual versions. About three to five videos are published per
year.
Under the present arrangements, production of sound recordings and videos is
commissioned by the Foundation for the Sorbian People [Za³ožba za serbski lud]. A Media
Commission decides on the works and/or projects to be contracted out.
The Internet also provides information on the Sorbs, which inter alia was contributed or is
attended to by Sorbisches Institut Bautzen or by Domowina. This information is published in
the German, Upper and Lower Sorbian, and English languages.*
Under Section 5, para. 2, of the Act on Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB Act), the
broadcaster ORB is obligated, in compliance with its programming mandate, to include
production companies in Brandenburg Land in its contract award process. To a considerable
extent, marketers from the traditional settlement area of the Sorbian people benefit from this
regulation. Also, ORB is obligated to operate a radio and television studio in the Lower
Sorbian language area in Cottbus.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Newspaper –
(e)

*

(i)
to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or
maintenance of at least one newspaper in the regional or minority
languages; or

e.g. "History of the Sorbs/Wends in Germany" [http://www-user.tu-cottbus.de/Sorben/inhalt06/domowina/eng/
historie.htm]; "Foundation for the Sorbian Nation" [http://www-user.tu-cottbus.de/Sorben/inhalt06/d01.htm] [T.'s
Note]

92

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and the Land of
Brandenburg.
There is little scope for [state] action/influence on account of the freedom of the press
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq.]).
For the Sorbian people, the following Sorbian- language print media are published on a
regular basis:
- Serbske Nowiny (Sorbische Zeitung - Sorbian Newspaper) - 2000 copies
A daily in Upper Sorbian, published on Mondays through Fridays as an evening paper;
on Fridays: including specific supplements, e.g. literature/arts, youngsters' supplement,
sports supplement (Sokolske listy)
Circulation: Mondays through Thursdays: 1500 copies; Fridays 2000 copies
- Nowy Casnik (Neue Zeitung - New Weekly) - 1100 copies
A weekly in Lower Sorbian, with a German- language portion; published on Saturdays
- Rozhlad (Umschau - Outlook) - 610 copies
A monthly periodical for Sorbian culture, language, literature and art, with articles in
the Upper and Lower Sorbian languages
- Serbska Šula (Sorbische Schule - Sorbian School) - 210 copies
Educational journal, with articles in the Upper and Lower Sorbian languages; 10
editions per year
- Plomjo / Plomje (Flamme - Flame) - 2400 / 950 copies
Children's and youngsters' journal
Plomjo: Upper Sorbian edition, 2400 copies
Plomje: Lower Sorbian edition, 950 copies
- Katolski Posol (Katholischer Bote - Catholic Herald) - 2650 copies
Upper Sorbian weekly of the Catholic Sorbs
- Pomhaj Bóh (Gott hilf - Help God) - 1200 copies
Protestant monthly in Upper Sorbian

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) ii - Financial Assistance for Audiovisual Productions –
(ii)
to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to
audiovisual productions in the regional or minority languages;
This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony.
Direct financial assistance by the State is problematic, due to the freedom of broadcasting
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
For details, cf. the comments above on sub-paragraph (d).
It should also be pointed out that, while Brandenburg Land has not adopted this obligation,
the exis ting measures to provide financial support for audiovisual works also extend to
productions in the Lower Sorbian language. Express mention will be made of this fact when
the subsidizing principles for film promotion will be established.

93

re: Art. 11, para. 2 - Freedom of Direct Reception of Broadcasts, and Freedom of
Expression –
(2)
The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language
used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and
not to oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in such a language. They further undertake to
ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise
of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony and by the Land of
Brandenburg.
As regards the fundamental conditions governing freedom of expression and reception of
broadcasts, cf. the detailed comments in Part C above on Article 11 [pp. 46 seqq.].
Also, it should be pointed out that Sorbian, as a Slavic language, is related to Polish and to
Czech and that, on account of the Sorbs' settlement area being close to the borders with
Poland and the Czech Republic, Polish and Czech radio and television broadcasts can be
received within the limits of technical feasibility. The transmission and direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts in Lower Sorbian (and Low German) have been explicitly
regulated, with due regard to the availability of technical capabilities, on the basis of the
retransmission provisions of Sections 37 and 38 of the State Treaty between the Länder of
Berlin and Brandenburg on Co-operation in the Field of Broadcasting (State Treaty on Media Services) as amended on 21 December 1998.

Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
(1)
With regard to cultural activities and facilities - especially libraries,
video libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres
and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular
forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including
inter alia the use of new technologies - the Parties undertake, within the
territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
(a)
to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works
produced in these languages;

94

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

to foster the different means of access in ot her languages to works
produced in regional or minority languages by aiding and
developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling
activities;
to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced
in other languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;
to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for
incorporating the knowledge and use of regional or minority
languages and cultures in the undertakings which they initiate or
for which they provide backing;
to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organising or supporting cultural activities have at their disposal
staff who have a full command of the regional or minority language
concerned, as well as of the language(s) of the rest of the
population;
to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities;
to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or
publishing works produced in the regional or minori ty languages;
if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to
maintaining and developing appropriate administrative, commercial,
economic, social, technical or legal terminology in each regional or
minority language.

The obligations under sub-paragraphs (a) to (h) have been accepted by the Free State of
Saxony and by the Land of Brandenburg; since the pertinent activities are pursued across
Land borders, the implementation measures are presented for both of these Länder.
The Sorbs have their traditional settlement area in the Free State of Saxony and in the Land
of Brandenburg. In order to avoid separate promotional policies in Saxony and
Brandenburg, these two Länder have, mutually and with the Bund [Federal Government],
agreed a common promotion policy. This policy has been embodied in the Foundation for
the Sorbian People (Za³ožba za serbski lud) (for details, cf. the comments above in Part A,
no. 4.3.2 [pp. 14 seqq.).
The Deutsch-Sorbisches Volkstheater (German-Sorbian Folk Theatre), Bautzen, is
subsidized as part of project promotion by the Foundation. In addition to institutional
promotion, project-oriented promotion by the Foundation covers a wide range of subjects,
for instance production of movies and sound recordings, projects related to the cultivation of
culture, traditions and folklore, competitions for various age groups and fields of interest.
Support is given not only by the Foundation or, for other measur es, by the Länder but also
by the local authorities and Landkreise [rural county-type administrative districts] in the
traditional settlement area. This is the case, in particular, as regards promotion of traditional
festivals carried out, and customs observed, by Sorbian associations. Cultural groups and
associa tions are actively fostered and supported by local authorities. Maintenance of Sorbian
customs is an integral part of almost all local mass events in the traditional settlement area

95

of the Sorbian people. In most cases, these customs are also kept up and practised by the
fellow-citizens belonging to the majority population.
Another priority of cultural promotion at the local government level is educational work. It
is especially due to the work of the museums provided by local self-administration bodies
that items of the Sorbian cultural heritage are collected, made accessible to the public, and
elucidated in lectures, guided tours, etc. Also, many centres displaying pieces of local customs and traditions (so-called Heimatstuben) which are supported by local authorities within
the framework of project promotion, preserve the Sorbian cultural heritage and make others
familiar with it.
With a view to conveying the Sorbian cultural values and traditions and the Sorbian people's
way of life in an authentic way, the association "Sorbischer Kulturtourismus e.V." (Sorbian
Cultural Tourism, registered association) formed in 1996. With its projects, inter alia
development of a Sorbian Cultural Route, it intends, without aiming at superficial
commercialization for tourism purposes, to make Sorbian institutions, museums and local
traditional centres (Heimatstuben) accessible to tourism on a greater scale. This requires
close co-operation with many individuals and institutions. The Sorbian Affairs Commissioners of the Free State of Saxony and of Brandenburg Land are to be involved as well. There
is close co-operation with the Working Group "Serbske pomniki - Sorbische Denkmale"
(Sorbian Architectural Monuments), the aim of which also is preservation of Sorbian cultural monuments.
As regards the various obligations, the following clarifying and additional points are made:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a)
The Foundation for the Sorbian People fulfils its purpose by promoting individual projects
and by supporting institutions dedicated to specific aspects of maintaining the Sorbian
culture, e.g. Domowina Publishing House. The Foundation is taking great care to achieve
inclusion of all forms of cultural expression and artistic creation. In particular, great store is
set not only to providing the cond itions for preserving traditional cultural assets but also to
ensuring that more recent forms of Sorbian cultural expression get their due, e.g. by promoting young artists and authors or supporting innovative art forms.

re: para. 1, sub-paras. (b) and (c)
Sorbisches Institut (Sorbian Institute) in Bautzen (Saxony) - which operates a branch in
Cottbus (Brandenburg), a scholarly institution dealing specifically with the Lower Sorbian
language - devotes its work not only to preserving the knowledge of the linguistic heritage,
but also to the contemporary development of this language. This ensures continuing
translatability of texts from one language into the other. However, the Sorbian Institute does
not make its own translations but, instead, only provides the scholarly prerequisites for this.
The most important Sorbian- language newspaper in Brandenburg, Nowy Casnik ("New
Weekly"), regularly publishes articles in German as well. The newspaper's use of both languages results in greater effectiveness.

96

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d)
The inclusion of Sorbian cultural activities in the work of regional cultural providing bodies
is ensured. Under the Saxon Sorbs Act and the Brandenburg Act on the Specification of the
Rights of the Sorbs (Wends), the local self-administration bodies are obligated to take
account of the Sorbian language and culture in their cultural policy/project planning, and
implement this mandate by supporting cultural activities of associations and of other cultural
actors and by including them in their own cultural projects.
Also, regional cultural activities play a prominent role in the tourist industry, in particular.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e)
The Foundation for the Sorbian People disposes of staff members having a good command
of the Sorbian language.
In all other respects, the Foundation's structure ensures that Sorbs can exercise a decisive
influence on the allocation of the Foundation's funds. The Director of the Foundation cannot
be elected against the majority of the Sorbian (Wendish) representatives on the Foundation
Board (Stiftungsrat). The majority of representatives on the Foundation Commission [a
committee of the Foundation Board] are Sorbs. To replace the original unincorporated
foundation of 1991, the new, legally autonomous Foundation has now been established.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f)
Cf. the comments on the preceding sub-paragraphs.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g)
Preservation of the Sorbian (Wendish) cultural heritage is the responsibility of the
Foundation for the Sorbian People. Scholarly assessment and analysis, which also includes
the preservation of testimonies of past times, is incumbent on Sorbisches Institut in Bautzen,
which operates a branch in Cottbus, dealing specifically with the Lower Sorbian language
and culture.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h)
The work of Sorbisches Institut includes work on recent linguistic developments, especially
as regards technical terms, and on specific technical languages, such as business/economic
terminology and administrative language. It is ensured that the Lower Sorbian language will
remain open also with regard to modern linguistic developments and will be able to follow
and integrate these deve lopments.

97

re: Art. 12, para. 2
(2)
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow,
encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in
accordance with the preceding paragraph.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, cultural activities keeping within the framework of the
law in force are not subject to any permit procedure or restrictions. Thus, the above
obligation is already fulfilled by the system of law in the Federal Republic of Germany.
Thanks to the broad definition of the specified purposes for which the public promotional
funds may be used in the context of the cultural work of the Sorbian people, it is also
possible to offer activities outside the immediate language area.

re: Art. 12, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing
their cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the
cultures they reflect.
The work of the Foundation for the Sorbian People ensures that due account is taken of
transborder co-operation, especially with the Slav neighbours. Under Article 2, para. 2, no.
5, of the State Treaty establishing the Foundation, the promotion of projects serving to enhance international understanding and co-operation with other ethnic groups and minorities
in Europe and to cultivate the historically evolved relations of the Sorbs with their Slav
neighbours is considered part of fulfilling the objectives of the Foundation.
The following are examples of transfrontier cultural policy:
1. Brandenburg
Transborder cultural co-operation, especially with Poland, makes appropriate provision for
the Sorbian culture in the sense that Sorbian artists, writers, etc. are regularly involved in
jointly organized cultural events ("Poets' Steamer", transfrontier seminars, colloquies, etc.).
2. Free State of Saxony
The Free State of Saxony presented itself at the so-called Sächsische Tage ["Saxon Days"
festival] in Wroclaw/Breslau (Poland) in June 1998. This event involved the Serbski Muzej
Budyšin (Sorbian Museum in Bautzen), with a special exhibition dedicated to the Sorbian
traditions and customs, and the Deutsch-Sorbisches Volkstheater (German-Sorbian Folk
Theatre), with a performance in the Sorbian language.

Article 13
Economic and Social Life
(1)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake
within the whole country:
(a)
to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or
limiting without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority
languages in documents relating to economic or social life,
particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
(b)
to prohibit the insertion, in internal regulations of companies and
private documents, of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of
regional or minority languages, at least between users of the same
language;
(c)
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;
The obligations under sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) have been accepted by the Free State of
Saxony and Brandenburg Land. They are in compliance with the established law of the
Federal Republic of Germany and thus are fulfilled nation-wide for all regional or minority
languages. Pertinent violations of the legal order have not become known. Therefore, no
special measures had to be taken by these Länder.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Facilitating the Use of the Regional or Minority Language –
(d)

to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority
languages by means other than those specified in the above subparagraphs.

Use of the Sorbian language in private depends, to a large extent, on the Sorbian people
themselves, especially on whether the language is passed on to their children. For the central
settlements with a large share, or even the majority, of Sorbs, this is more the case than for
families in larger places and towns where they constitute a dispersed minority. In the case of
the Sorbs, too, the existence of many mixed marriages has an influence on the language
spoken within the family and on the extent to which Sorbian is passed on to the children so
that attendance of Sorbian schools is of particular importance to these children.
Use of the Sorbian language in public is rendered difficult by the fact that the German-Sorbian settlement area is not generally bilingual but that, as a rule, only the Sorbs have a
command of both languages. Therefore, apart from a number of exceptions, greater use is
being made of German than of the Sorbian language in public and also in church.
There are many and various ways in which the State promotes the learning and use of
minority languages (cf. the comments on the various obligations). In particular, efforts are
encouraged among the general public to keep these languages alive by using them within the
family and in extra- familiar everyday- life situations. In this regard, the cultural value of the
minority languages for Germany's cultural life is particularly emphasized so that, on the
basis of the resultant self- esteem and self- assurance, the younger generation will be more
willing to adopt these languages and pass them on. On account of the structures established

99

for the administration of matters of their own concern, the users of Sorbian are provided
with the practical means for using their language also in an extra-familiar context.
re: Art. 13, para. 2
(2)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake,
in so far as the public authorities are competent, within the territory in
which the regional or minority languages are used, and as far as this is
reasonably possible:

re: para. 2, sub-para. (c) - Social Care Facilities –
(c)

to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement
homes and hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in
their own language persons using a regional or minority language
who are in need of care on grounds of ill-health, old age or for other
reasons;

This obligation has been accepted by the Free State of Saxony.
Social care facilities in the bilingual region also employ Sorbian staff who are able to speak
Sorbian with persons in need of care. Schweinerden in Kamenz Landkreis has the Catholic
Sorbian nursing home for elderly people, "St. Ludmila". The nursing home will in future be
replaced by a new building financed, for the major part, with public funds of the Federation,
of the Free State of Saxony and of the local government concerned. The providing body of
the home offers pastoral care and cultivates the Sorbian traditions and customs.
However, recruitment of bilingual staff is not pursued expressly by social care facilities.

Article 8
Education
(1)
With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory
in which such languages are used, according to the situation of each of
these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official
language(s) of the State:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Pre-School Education –
(a)

(i)
to make available pre-school education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii
above at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose
number is considered sufficient; or
(iv)
if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of pre-school education, to favour and/or encourage the
application of the measures referred to under i to iii above;

In the Land of Schleswig-Holstein, the legal basis for providing the possibility to learn one's
own language in the settlement area of the Frisian ethnic group is Article 5, para. 2, of the
Schleswig- Holstein Land Constitution, under which, inter alia, also the Frisian ethnic group
have a right to protection and promotion. There is no comparable regulation in the Land of
Lower Saxony, but possibilities for learning the Frisian language 3 (Saterland Frisian) are
being provided also in this Land.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligations under sub-paragraph (a) (iii) and (iv).
In the period 1993 - 1996, at the initiative of the Gremium für Fragen der friesischen
Volksgruppe beim Schleswig-Holsteinischen Landtag [Body set up by the SchleswigHolstein Landtag for Matters of the Frisian Ethnic Group], tests were run in nursery schools
of Schleswig-Holstein, in Süderende on the island of Föhr and in Risum- Lindholm, to find
out whether it is possible, on a sustained basis, to revitalize the Frisian language already in a
nursery-school context. On the basis of the findings obtained from the Model Test "Erwerb
friesischer Sprachkompetenz innerhalb und außerhalb der Schule" ["Acquisition of Frisian
Language Proficiency in School and Informal Education"], the Frisian language has, in the
meantime, been introduced in other nursery schools in Nordfriesland Kreis. At present it is
used, in varying degree, in 28 nursery schools.

a minority language; territorial scope: Lower Saxony (Saterland Frisian) and Schleswig-Holstein (North
Frisian)

101

2. Lower Saxo ny
Lower Saxony has entered into the obligation under sub-paragraph (a) (iv).
In the Sater Frisian speech area of the Land of Lower Saxony, Saterland Frisian is spoken if the parents so wish - for one hour per week with the children attending the five nursery
schools in Saterland Gemeinde.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Primary Education –
(b)

(i)
to make available primary education in the relevant regional
or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of primary education in
the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within primary education, for the teaching of the
relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of the
curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose number
is considered sufficient;

The Land of Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (b) (iv).
Frisian is taught at many publicly maintainted schools in the North Frisian speech area and
at a number of schools of the Danish minority. These are mainly primary schools. As a rule,
this instruction is offered as a voluntary optional-subject course for the 3rd and 4th grades.
However, this course is competing with foreign- language instruction (mainly English, but
also Danish). The willingness of parents to let their children take part in Frisian classes also
depends on whether, and how much, multilingual instruction is offered to the children.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Secondary Education –
(c)

(i)
to make available secondary education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of secondary education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within secondary education, for the teaching of
the relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of
the curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils who, or where appropriate whose families, so
wish in a number considered sufficient;

The Land of Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (c) (iv).
Frisian is taught at many publicly maintained schools in the North Frisian speech area, as
well as at some primary schools and secondary modern schools of the Danish minority.
During the 1998/99 school year, 21 teachers at 28 schools of all types (including primary

102

education within the meaning of Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (b), above) taught 171 hours of
Frisian per week to 1,330 pupils. At the Lindholm Primary and Secondary Modern School,
Frisian instruction is offered continuously from the 1st to the 9th grade. Secondary schools
offer such instruction only on a very limited scale. So far, Realschulen [secondary technical
school] in the Frisian speech area do not offer any Frisian instruction at all; and Gymnasien
[grammar schools] provide such courses only in their upper classes [second stage of
secondary education]. Only at one school, Frisian - in addition to Danish and German - is
also used as the teaching language for other subjects; this is the Primary and Secondary
Modern School - of which Dansk Skoleforening for Sydslesvig [Danish Schools Association
for South Schleswig] is the providing body - in Risum where Frisian instruction is
mandatory from 1st to 9th grade.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - University and Other Higher Education –
(e)

(ii)
to provide facilities for the study of these languages as
university and higher education subjects; or

1. Schleswig- Holstein
As part of a supplementary course of studies for the teaching profession for all school types,
Frisian is offered as a subject at Kiel University (CAU - Christian-Albrechts-Universität)
and at Flensburg University (UF - Universität Flensburg). In addition, participation in a
course in Low German or Frisian is one of the requirements stipulated for admission to
examinations in the subject "German".
The courses on offer at Flensburg University are supported by a part-time professorship and
other lectureships covering 15 hours per week per semester. In addition, Frisian can be
studied at Kiel University as a major or minor subject of the course of studies leading to a
Master's degree. A grade C3 professorship, covering eight hours per week per semester, has
been established for this purpose.
At the Frisian Institute of Flensburg University, 14 students are at present enrolled for
Frisian studies; Kiel University has 46 students of this subject. It may be assumed that in the
years to come, one or two Frisian- language teachers will graduate per year (First and Second State Examinations for teachers). Junior teachers for the subject of Frisian are to be
taken on as teachers in training at schools with Frisian instruction so that they will be
available without delay for this particular instruction.
Nordfriesische Wörterbuchstelle [North Frisian Dictionary Institute] at Kiel University
(CAU) has been in existence since 1950 and, since 1978, with "Frisian philology" as a study
subject, has been the only university institution for scholarly research on the Frisian
language in the Federal Republic of Germany. The professor for Frisian at Kiel University
also is the Director of Nordfriesische Wörterbuchstelle. This Institute has regular contacts
with the Frisian Academy of Leeuwarden [Netherlands Province of Friesland], with the
Mertens Instituut of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences, with the professorial
chairs for Frisian in Groningen and at the two Amsterdam universities, and with Nordfriisk
Instituut [North Frisian Institute] in Bredstedt (Germany).

103

2. Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony does not offer specific Frisian teacher training to supplement the course of
studies offered in Schleswig- Holstein.
Research on the Saterland Frisian history, culture and language is of more recent date.
Saterland Frisian has not been handed down as a written language. We know of a collection
of Saterland Frisian proverbs, dating from the year 1901. It was only after World War II that
the first spelling rules were laid down for this language. In 1980, a "Saterland Frisian
Dictionary" was published; a revised and significantly enlarged edition is in preparation.
Other publications are compilations of texts, such as "Saterfriesisches Volksleben" and "Saterfriesische Stimmen". The Zentralstelle für die sprachliche Landesforschung [Central
Office for Linguistic Regional Research] of Göttingen University, with the support of the
Administration of Saterland Gemeinde, carried out a poll among 10 per cent of the
inhabitants of the Saterland region. The project is to provide findings regarding the
awareness of the members of the ethnic group in respect of their own history and culture.
The study of the Saterland Frisian language lies, in particular, in the hands of a Germanist
[scholar studying German/Germanic languages and literatures] of Oldenburg University.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Adult Education –
(iii)

if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of adult education, to favour and/or encourage the
offering of such languages as subjects of adult and
continuing education;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
The Adult Education Centres in the Kreis of Nordfriesland in Schleswig-Holstein offer
Frisian language courses.
In addition, the accepted obligation is also implemented with the work of Nordfriisk
Instituut, i.e. the North Frisian Institute in Bredstedt, and of other Frisian organizations
which in part are Land-subsidized. As part of their cultural work, the local Frisian
organizations offer, inter alia, language courses for adults.
2. Lower Saxony
Katholisches Bildungswerk Saterland [Saterland Catholic Educational Association] once per
year offers the course "Speak and read Saterland Frisian"; this course covers ten 2-hour
evening classes.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Teaching of the History and Culture Education –
(g)

to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

On account of the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, implementation of
this provision is, in particular, a responsibility of the Länder. In the field of education in the

104

Länder, promoting the knowledge of the culture, history, languages and religion of the
respective minorities/language groups as well as of the majority population is part of the
curricula of publicly maintained and private schools. An important role in imparting
knowledge of the culture of the language groups, in and outside schools, is also played by
the state institutions for political education (i.e. the Federal Centre and the Land Centres for
Polical Education).
In all other regards, cf. the detailed comments in Part C on Article 8 [p. 43 above].
The undertakings entered into by the Länder ensure that also non-speakers of Frisian have
access to this language.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
The curricula of publicly maintained schools provide for many ways of dealing with
minority matters in class. North Frisian can, as a multidisciplinary subject, be offered in
classes for German, Danish, history, arts and music, and textile handicrafts.
Examples are:
Curriculum "German": "Study of the languages and speech communities in SchleswigHolstein", or study of the various cultures and languages of the Land.
Curriculum "music": to sing, arrange and play Christmas carols of various forms and
contents (e.g. traditional German, Low German, Frisian, foreign Christmas carols).
The materials mentioned below in the comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (h), have
been patterned closely on the subjects listed in the curricula, and consequently substantially
support the study of the North Frisian language as well as of specific cultural aspects.
2. Lower Saxony
The educational mandate to provide for instruction in the history and culture of the minority
language is laid down in Section 2 of the Schools Act of Lower Saxony stipulating that
pupils shall be enabled "... to develop their faculties of perception and sensitivity and their
capacity for expressing themselves, with the inclus ion of the relevant regional variety of
Low German or of Frisian, ...".
Under the Framework Curriculum of Lower Saxony, the history and culture, as manifested
in the Saterland Frisian language, can be covered in class, e.g. in the subjects "German" and
music" by including regional aspects when studying the language and its functions and
when singing and pla ying instruments.
The Sater Frisian language nowadays is a subject at three of the four primary schools of the
Saterland.
At Ramsloh primary school, one teacher teaches Saterland Frisian for a total of three hours
in grades 2 to 4. At Strücklingen primary school, the 2nd and 4th grades have two 1-hour
lessons each of Saterland Frisian per week, and the 3rd grade has one 1-hour lesson per
week. At Scharrel primary school, too, all pupils learn Saterland Frisian in activity groups
for one hour per week; at Sedelsberg primary school, Saterland Frisian is taught in class for
one hour a week for grades 1 to 4, as part of activity groups.

105

At Saterland Schulzentrum, two activity groups [AGs] of 5th and 6th -grade pupils have four
hours of Saterland Frisian lessons. At the primary school in Sedelsberg, two part-time
teachers offer an optional Saterland Frisian course to pupils of all grades.
Overall, 246 pupils in 19 learning groups (primary school, and lower secondary grades) at
present receive this Sater Frisian instruction which covers a total of 21 hours per week (the
number of pupils of grades 1 to 6 totals 1113 individuals).
Last year, the public-law corporation Ostfriesische Landschaft, as the lead body acting for
seven European speech communities, filed an application with the European Union for the
allocation of funds for the project "Mehrsprachigkeit in der Vor- und Grundschulperiode"
["Multilingualism in the Pre-School and Primary Education Stages"]. Efforts are being made
to have primary schools of the Saterland join this project. At present, the project is in its
orientation stage. The background for these efforts is the "Model Test: Bilingualism in
Nursery School" carried out by the Plattdütskbüro [Low German Office] in Ostfriesland
during the 1997/98 school year.
Continuation of minority language instruction at primary schools is considered good policy
since it is a means for promoting the language skills of children. Also, primary-school age is
particularly well suited for extending language skills to multilingualism through early
learning of foreign languages (English, French, Dutch/Flemish).
In the Saterland, Sater Frisian is taught not only by fully trained teachers but also by other
persons provided that these have the appropriate qualification and that there is a demand for
such instruction. Such persons may be employed as part-time teachers by the Land and will
be paid according to their respective teaching load. Thus they are equal in status with the
teachers for other subjects. Also, the Government of Weser-Ems Bezirk [District] will,
under the procedure for inviting applications for a position, point out that knowledge of
Saterland Frisian is desirable or even required.
The educational materials developed by the Sater Frisian teachers themselves are used
mainly in primary education. They are based on materials for English lessons in primary
school, materials of the teaching and learning system developed as part of the pilot project
"Plattdeutsch in der Schule" ["Low German in School"], and materials from the
Nordfriesland and West-Friesland language areas. Within the framework of follow-up
training of teachers, it is planned to develop a concept for learning Saterland Frisian in the
primary education stage.
In November 1999, the Working Panel for "Saterfriesisch in der Schule" ["Saterland Frisian
in School], which was founded in 1999, organized two days of follow-up training with the
focus on two subjects: Since neither the full-time nor the part-time (honorary) teachers have
studied Frisian, they are unsure as regards points of grammar and phonetic transcription.
These teachers are to expand their knowledge of the language and familiarize themselves
with the spelling of Saterland Frisian.
The Saterland Frisians expect the State to increase its follow- up training measures and to
provide funds for the development of educational materials.
The expectation of the Frisian ethnic group overall is that Frisian instruction will be
gradually expanded and, going on from primary education, will be directly continued at

106

Realschulen [secondary technical schools] and in the lower secondary grades of Gymnasien
[grammar schools].

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Basic and Further Training of Teachers –
(g) to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;
The Land of Schleswig- Holstein has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (h).
The essential task of the Nordfriesland Supervisory School Authority at present is to
coordinate and support the measures taken for promoting the Frisian language. The most
important measures in this respect are the publication and dissemination of teachers' sup port
material for Frisian lessons, and the establishment of a 'learning workshop'.
Since October 1999, six volumes of teachers' support material have been available to
schools. They have been patterned closely on the curricula. This provides for Frisian
teaching material which, taking due account of the various local idioms spoken on the
mainland and on the islands, make it possible for every teacher to develop the required
versions for him/herself.
This work is continued in the Frisian 'learning workshop' where educational materials,
translations of children's books into Frisian, games and audiovisual media are available for
pupils' groups and for follow- up training of teachers. For many years, Frisian teachers have
regularly met in a Working Group. In order to make the results of the work of the 'learning
workshop' available to as many teachers as possible, two approaches to providing
information have been adopted. On the one hand, specific opening times have been laid
down for teachers while it is also possible to fix dates of one's own choice. On the other
hand, the meetings of Frisian teachers, which were instituted and are organized by the IPTS
(Institut für Praxis und Theorie der Schule [Institute for Practical and Theoretical School
Matters]), are used for presenting and disseminating the newly developed aids and materials.
This ensures that all Frisian teachers will be supplied continuously with new information
and media.
The Nordfriisk Instituut [North Frisian Institute] in Bredstedt has developed a wide range of
material for designing and organizing school activities. It remains to be seen what the
impact of the use of these new materials will be.
As regards the possibility for teachers to take a supplementary exam in Frisian, cf. the
comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (e) (ii) [p. 96 above].

e: para. 1, sub-para. (i) - Supervisory Bodies –
(i)

to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing
the teaching of regional or minority languages and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings which will be made public.

1. Schleswig- Holstein

107

For the supervision of the measures taken in primary schools, secondary modern schools
and Realschulen [secondary technical schools], responsibility lies with the supervisory
school authorities of the Kreise [administrative districts] or kreisfreie Städte [non-district
municipalities]. The Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Cultural Affairs of
Schleswig- Holstein Land is responsible for the supervision of Gymnasien [grammar
schools] and comprehensive schools.
2. Lower Saxony
In November 1997, a Working Group was established, with representatives from the Landschaften and Landschaftsverbände [regional local authorities], the Niedersächsischer
Heimatbund [Lower Saxony Union for Local and Regional Traditions] and the schools
offices. The task of this Working Group is to monitor the proper implementation of the
obligations under the Charter which have been accepted by the Land.
Responsibility for the preparation and regular publication of the report regarding the
provisions on education lies with the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs of Lower
Saxony.

re: Art. 8, para. 2
(2)

With regard to education and in respect of territories other than
those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally
used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or
minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the
appropriate stages of education.

This undertaking has been entered into only by Schleswig- Holstein Land.
As regards colleges and universities, this obligation - in the sense of "undertake ... to allow"
- is met for the entire territory of the Federal Republic by virtue of Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law (autonomy of institutions of higher education* ).

Article 9
Judicial Authorities
(1)
The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which
the number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies
the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the
present paragraph is not considered by the judge to hamper the proper
administration of justice:

*

"(3) Art and scholarship, research, and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching ..."

108

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Civil Proceedings –
(b)

in civil proceedings:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
With the proviso that documents and evidence drafted in a minority language must be
presented in a form obviating misunderstandings or errors with regard to their translation,
this obligation is met by the legal situation prevailing in Germany. Therefore, no special
measures have been taken.
2. Lower Saxony
Cf. the preceding remarks regarding the Land of Schleswig-Holstein.

(c)

in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

With regard to this obligation which has been entered into by Schleswig- Holstein and
Lower Saxony, reference is made to the foregoing comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para.
(b) (iii).
As regards this branch of the judiciary, it must be pointed out that administrative courts are
obliged to conduct ex officio investigations and, where necessary and appropriate, will on
their own initiative rely on the services of interpreters. Thus, the members of the language
group suffer no prejudice by the use of their language.
re: para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Validity of Legal Documents –
(2)

The Parties undertake:
(a)
not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within
the State solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority
language; or

With regard to this obligation which has been entered into by Schleswig- Holstein and
Lower Saxony, reference is made to the above comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (b)

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
(1)
Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the
measures specified below and according to the situation of each language,
the Parties undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) v - Submission of Documents –
(a)

(v)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
validly submit a document in these languages;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
The legal basis for assuming this obligation is Section 82a, para. 2, of the Land
Administration Act. This discretionary regulation provides for the general possibility to
submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other documents in a foreign language, i.e. a
language other than the official language.
According to a non-representative survey carried out among subordinate agencies of the
Ministry of the Interior of Schleswig-Holstein Land, use is made of this possibility, inter
alia, by land survey offices [cadastral offices] and by the Land Statistical Office.
2. Lower Saxony
In Saterland Gemeinde, no problems exist as regards submission of legal documents drafted
in Saterland Frisian. In practice, however, no use has been made of possibility.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Drafting of Documents –
(c)

to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a
regional or minority language.

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Lower Saxony. The local authority [i.e.
Saterland Gemeinde] is prepared at any time to draft documents in the minority language.
So far, however, no requests to this effect have been made.

re: Art. 10, para. 2
(2)
In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory
the number of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is
such as to justify the measures specified below, the Parties undertake to
allow and/or encourage:

110

re: para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Use of a Regional or Minority Language
(a)
the use of regional or minority languages within the
framework of the regional or local authority;
1. Schleswig- Holstein
Schleswig- Holstein has not explicitly adopted this obligation. However, a large number of
staff members of the Ämter [local authority unions] and local authorities of Nordfriesland
Kreis have a good knowledge of the North Frisian language. As a result, some public
employees, especially in the island communities, deal in Frisian with personal callers during
office hours if the callers so wish. The spoken message in the wait loop of the telephone
system of the Nordfriesland Kreis Administration is given in four languages (German,
Frisian, Danish, and Low German).
2. Lower Saxony
In Saterland Gemeinde in Lower Saxony, where some 2000 people speak this minority
language, the local authorities promote the use of this language. Staff members indicate
their proficiency in Saterland Frisian on their office doorplates.
In Saterland Gemeinde, it is possible to have civil marriages and other official acts
performed in the Frisian language.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (b) - Submission of Applications –
(b)
the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to
submit oral or written applications in these languages;
In Saterland Gemeinde in Lower Saxony, citizens may present their requests in Saterland
Frisian. The replies will equally be furnished in this language.
Also, applications may be submitted in Saterland Frisian. As stated by the local authority,
no use has so far been made of this possibility.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (c) - Publication by Regional Authorities of Official Documents –
in Frisian
(b)
the publication by regional authorities of their official
documents also in the rel evant regional or minority languages;
This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Lower Saxony. Since Saterland Gemeinde,
to which the speech area of Frisian [in Lower Saxony] is confined, represents the localgovernment level, the pertinent implementation measures are described under sub-para. (d)
below.

the publication by local authorities of their official
documents also in the relevant regional or minority languages;
So far, there has been no such publication in Saterland Frisian; however, pertinent
preparations are underway with regard to short official communications (e.g. notices on the
bulletin board), especially as regards standard texts, which are then to be published as
bilingual notices.

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Lower Saxony. Since Saterland Gemeinde,
to which the speech area is confined, represents the local- government level, the pertinent
implement ation measures are discussed under sub-para. (f) below.

the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages
in debates in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use
of the official language(s) of the State;
1. Schleswig- Holstein
Schleswig- Holstein has not explicitly adopted this obligation. However, on the North
Frisian islands and Halligen [holms], local council meetings are held in the Frisian
language, provided that no local councillor or no visitor attending a meeting objects to such
use.
2. Lower Saxony
Local council members do not make use of the Frisian language - mainly out of
consideration for persons who do not speak the language or do not have a sufficient
command of it.

the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the
name in the official language(s), of traditional and correct forms of
place-names in regional or minority languages.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
So far, Schleswig- Holstein has not explicitly adopted this obligation, but has already made
provision for its adoption. By a Decree of 20 August 1997, the Ministry of Economics,
Technology and Transport of Schleswig- Holstein Land has allowed bilingual place-name
signs (in German and Frisian) to be put up in the Nordfriesland Kreis, at the request of the
local governments concerned. This was done in compliance with a suggestion put forward
by the Nordfriisk Instituut [North Frisian Institute] and by a number of North Frisian
communities and the (then) Border Region Commissioner. So far, seven communities
(Risum-Lindholm, Bredstedt, Nebel on the Island of Amrum, Niebüll, Norddorf on Amrum,
Utersum on the Island of Föhr, and Kampen on the Island of Sylt) have made use of this
provision; other local authorities are about to adopt such bilingual signs.
2. Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony has not explicitly adopted this obligation.
Consent to the use of bilingual place-name signs in the Sater Frisian settlement area was
given on 8 June 2000 by the responsible Department of Lower Saxony, i.e. the Ministry of
Economics, Technology and Transport.

With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the
following measures:

re: para. 4, sub-para. (a) - Translation or Interpretation
(a)

translation or interpretation as may be required;

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Lower Saxony.
The facilities and staff required for the purpose are available in Saterland Gemeinde. But in
this context, it is to be noted that it is relatively difficult to write Saterland Frisian, and thus
considerable work is involved.

re: para. 4, sub-para. (c) - Appointment of Public Service Employees having a Knowledge
of the Minority Language - (of Frisian)

113

(c)

compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to
be appointed in the territory in which that language is used.

1. Schleswig- Holstein
With a view to implementing this obligation, an announcement to this effect was made at
the Personalreferentenkonferenz (PRK - Conference of Personnel Officers) on 24 June
1999. The PRK brings together the personnel officers of the supreme Land authorities at
regular meetings with the aim of co-ordinating and harmonizing the essential crossdepartmental decisions in the field of personnel management.
If a staff member within the Land Administration expresses a wish regarding such an
appointment, the scope for complying with the request will be examined. So far, however,
there have been no requests to this effect at the Land Government level.
2. Lower Saxony
If a staff member of the Saterland Gemeinde Administration expresses a wish regarding
such an appointment, the scope for complying with the request will be examined. So far,
however, no requests to this effect have been made.

re: Art. 10, para. 5
(5)
The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names
in the regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned
This obligation has been explicitly accepted by the Länder of Schleswig-Holstein and
Lower Saxony. In this regard, cf. also the comments in Part C above on Article 10 [pp. 44
seqq.].

Article 11
Media
(1)
The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority
languages within the territories in which those languages are spoken,
according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public
authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role
in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) ii - Broadcasting of Radio Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;

114

1. Schleswig- Holstein
In a letter of 29 September 1999, the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Land has
encouraged the radio and TV station programme directors of Norddeutscher Rundfunk
(NDR), Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television, or Channel II),
DeutschlandRadio, Radio Schleswig-Holstein, NORA (NordOstseeRAdio), delta radio and
POWER RADIO Nord to integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the features
determining the specificity of our Land" in their programmes; intensification of first action
already taken in this respect would be welcomed. In the spirit of the Regional/Minority
Language Charter, the Minister-President urged that "further avenues should be explored for
integrating contributions in the minority languages and in the regional language Low
German into their programmes, as a service for the citizens and in support of this element of
the culture of Schleswig-Holstein".
In addition, the following provisions have been laid down:
Ÿ The broadcasting corporation under public law (Norddeutscher Rundfunk - NDR) has the
legal mandate to report on the cultural diversity and the special features of the respective
Land and to give its support to the protection of minorities.
Ÿ Adequate room must be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture
and language.
Ÿ Programming principles for private broadcasting: programmes shall help to (...) achieve
protection and promotion of minorities.
Ÿ Protected minorities have access to the media, and scope for participation, on the same
conditions as other groups of society. The provisions of the Land Broadcasting Act
promote programming diversity and the variety of broadcasters.
Ÿ The Land Broadcasting Act was amended in 1999. In future, the previous Assembly of
the supervisory authority Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR - the
Schleswig- Holstein Land broadcasting institution for private broadcasters) will be
replaced by a Media Council. Any socially relevant group, organization or association of
supraregional stand ing is entitled to make nominations for the election of the Media
Council.
Ÿ In addition, the ULR operates two radio broadcasting "Open Channels" in SchleswigHolstein. Through these Open Channels, anybody who is not a broadcaster himself, can
disseminate his/her own contributions via radio broadcasting.
Legal Bases:
Inter-State Treaty on Norddeutscher Rundfunk [NDR State Treaty] (of 1 March 1992):
Article 3, para. 3; Article 5, para. 2, 1 st sentence; Article 7, para. 2, 3rd sentence;
Inter-State Agreement on the Public Corporation Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) (of
26 January 1998): Article 5, para. 2;
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 17, para. 2, nos. 1 and 2; Section 24,
para. 3; Section 34, para. 1, 1st - 3rd sentences; Section 54, para. 3.
Facts and Examples:
Once per week, the radio programme of NDR 1 - Welle Nord has, since 1989, aired a 1-hour
evening broadcast about Schleswig-Holstein, which also includes about 3 ½ minutes in the
Frisian language ("Freesk for enarken" ) - this is a sub-regional broadcast for Nordfriesland
Kreis. Also, there are regular 1-hour feature broadcasts in the Frisian language (e.g. on 1
December 1999: "A nuardfresken eran an üüb sia" - The North Frisians and the Sea).

115

At irregular intervals, R.SH [Schleswig-Holstein Radio] airs a 1-hour special single-subject
broadcast in the Frisian language at 19.00 hours, in the sub-regional transmission area of the
entire West coast and the Flensburg/Schleswig area.
Since 4 October 1999, a programme of Radio Friislon has been broadcast by Offener Kanal
Westküste (Heide/Husum) on every first Monday of the month (at 15.00 - 15.30), and is
repeated on every third Monday at the same time. Radio Friislon is open to the diversity of
languages spoken in Nordfriesland, the 'land of languages', and especially to the Frisian
language with its various dialects. The programme is produced by Nordfriisk Instituut, in
co-operation with the "ferian för en nuurdfresk radioo (ffnr)" [Association for a North
Frisian Radio Station]. The broadcasting station NDR makes its contributions available free
of cost. The presenters of Radio Friislon have been trained by NDR 1 - Welle Nord. So far, a
total of eight Frisian-speaking staff members have been trained.
2. Lower Saxony
Under the Inter-State Treaty on Norddeutscher Rundfunk which was concluded by the Free
and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the Länder of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower
Saxony and Schleswig- Holstein, the programming mandate of Norddeutscher Rundfunk, as
a broadcasting corporation under public law, stipulates, inter alia, that adequate room must
be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture and language (Section 5,
para. 2, of the NDR Inter-State Treaty).
The Broadcasting Centres of the Länder produce Land programmes, as a full-day radio and
regional programme on TV, which present, inter alia, the cultural and social life of the
respective Land (Section 3, para. 3, of the NDR Inter-State Treaty). This also covers various
broadcasts about the Sater Frisian language which, however, are not aired at fixed
broadcasting times but in the context of current affairs reporting.
The Lower Saxony Land Broadcasting Act lays down that the programmes of private
broadcasters must make appropriate allowance also for the cultural diversity of the regions
and for the regional languages spoken in Lower Saxony (Section 17, para. 2, of the Land
Broadcasting Act). Compliance with these requirements is also monitored by the (minimum
number of) 41 members of the Assembly of the Lower Saxony Land Supervisory Authority
for Private Broadcasters [Niedersächsische La ndesmedienanstalt]. All major groups of
society or organizations of the Land are entitled to make nominations as regards
representation on the Assembly.
The Niedersächsische Landesmedienanstalt [Land supervisory authority for private
broadcasters of Lower Saxony] also supports non-commercial local broadcasters and the
Open Channels. It is especially in these programmes with a focus on regional and local
settings that specific cultural features and linguistic minorities are included and presented.
In the East Frisian (Ostfriesland) area, this also applies to Saterland Frisian.
Broadcasters, also in view of their own interest, strive to meet the legal requirements. In
addition, the Land of Lower Saxony - within the limits of its scope for exerting an influence
- encourages radio and television broadcasters to take greater account of, and to present,
regional special features of the culture and language. As regards the Saterland Frisian
language, however, this can be achieved to a very limited extent only, given that this
minority language is used in a relatively small area.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) ii - Broadcasting of Television Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
1. Schleswig- Holstein
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on Article 11, para. 1, sub-para. (b)
(ii) - "1. - Schleswig-Holstein".
The Schleswig-Holstein-Magazin - which is aired daily, except on Sundays - often includes
broadcasts on the Frisian tradition and culture, e.g. "Jahrhundertstory" ["Story of the
Century"].
The regional programmes of Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German
Television) also air broadcasts on the Frisian language as part of current affairs reporting or
with reference to events of particular significance.
2. Lower Saxony
Reference is made to the comments above on Article 11, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (ii) - "2. Lower Saxony".
Since a relatively small segment of the population is the target group of television
programmes in the Saterland Frisian language, there have been no regular broadcasts so far.
In compliance with the programming mandate (Section 5, para. 2, in conjunction with Section 3, of the NDR Inter-State Treaty), the NDR regional programme (i.e. N3) sporadically
airs broadcasts about Sater Frisian.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Audio and Audiovisual Works –
(d)

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of
audio and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
The programming principles laid down for public service broadcasting and for private
broadcasting provide an indirect incentive: The broadcasting programmes shall contribute
(...) to the protection and promotion of minorities.
In addition, subsidies may be granted. The relevant provision reads as follows:
"The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide
financial support to non-profit organizations with cultural (...) aims, especially in the
audiovisual sector (...)."
Additional support is provided by the Gesellschaft zur Förderung audiovisueller Werke in
Schleswig-Holstein mbH (MSH - Limited Liability Company for the Promotion of
Audiovisual Works in Schleswig-Holstein). MSH obtains funds from the NDR broadcasting
corporation and from ULR [the Schleswig- Holstein supervisory authority for private

118

broadcasters]. These funds are used for the promotion of commissioned productions and
coproductions in the cinema sector, television and sound broadcasting.
Legal Basis:
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 24, para. 3; Section 53, para. 2;
Section 73, para. 2.
Otherwise, it is left to the (linguistic) minorities, on the basis of the cultural promotion by
the Land and of the principle of self- government, to decide on pertinent measures and to
implement these within the limits of the overall funds available.
2. Lower Saxony
The programming principles described above (cf. the comments on sub-paras. (b) and (c) of
para. 1) - which are laid down in the NDR Inter-State Treaty for public service broadcasting
and in the Land Broadcasting Act for private broadcasting - are designed also to provide
motivation for producing and disseminating audio and audiovisual works in the Saterland
Frisian language.
Upon application, the Land of Lower Saxony, in view of supporting such productions within
the framework of cultural promotion, grants subsidies to the production costs.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Newspaper Articles –
(e)

(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper
articles in the regional or minority languages on a regular basis;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
There is little scope for [state] action/influence on account of the freedom of the press
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
However, the Verband der Zeitungsverlage Norddeutschland e.V. [Association of
Newspaper Publishers for Northern Germany] takes the protection of minoritie s and of
linguistic groups very seriously. For this reason, and on acccount of requests to this effect
by readers, reports in the Frisian language have become an integral part of a number of
newspapers in the North Frisian speech area.
In a letter of 29 September 1999 addressed, inter alia, to the Zeitungsverlegerverband
Schleswig-Holstein e.V. [Schleswig- Holstein Association of Newspaper Publishers, reg'd],
the Minister-President of Schleswig- Holstein Land has encouraged the addressees to
integrate "linguistic particularities which determine the specificity of our Land" in their
publications; intensification of first action already taken in this respect would be welcomed
by her.
The following publications are available:
Husumer Nachrichten (Husum News; 22,348 copies), a monthly paper;
Insel-Bote (Island Herald; 3,948 copies), a monthly paper;
Nordfriesland Tageblatt (Nordfriesland Newspaper; 9,250 copies), a monthly paper.

119

2. Lower Saxony
On account of the freedom of the press as guarantueed by the Cons titution, there is, on
principle, no scope for direct [state] action/influence. Moreover, it is not possible, with a
view to competitiveness, to impose binding requirements on publishing houses.
On appropriate occasions, the Land Government repeatedly makes appeals to include and
present the Saterland Frisian language also in press publications. This appeal is addressed
both directly to the publishing houses and through the Verband Nordwestdeutscher Zeitungsverleger [Association of North West German Newspaper Publishers].
Therefore, articles in Saterland Frisian also appear in the home-editions of the regional
newspapers read in Ostfriesland.
The following dailies are published in this region:
Ÿ Emder Zeitung
(Emden Newspaper; some 10,850 copies)
Ÿ General-Anzeiger, Rhauderfehn (Gazette; some 10,830 copies)
Ÿ Ostfriesen-Zeitung, Leer
(East Frisians' Newspaper; a total of some 40,900
copies)
Ÿ Ostfriesen Nachrichten, Aurich (East Frisian News; some 13,350 copies)
Ÿ Ostfriesischer Kurier, Norden (East Frisian Courier; some 15,000 copies)
Ÿ Rheiderland, Weener
(some 6,000 copies)

1. Schleswig- Holstein
Direct financial assistance by the State is problematic, due to the freedom of broadcasting
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
In addition, subsidies may be granted. The relevant provision reads as follows:
"The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide

re: Art. 11, para. 2 - Freedom of Direct Reception of Broadcasts, and Freedom of
Expression –
(2)
The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language
used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and
not to oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in such a language. They further undertake to
ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise
of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
These obligations have been accepted by Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. For the
implementation measures, cf. the detailed comments on paragraph 1 above and, in Part C,
on Article 11 [p. 46].

Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
(1)
With regard to cultural activities and facilities - especially libraries,
video libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres
and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular
forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including
inter alia the use of new technologies - the Parties undertake, within the
territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:

122

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Types of Expression, and Access to Works –
(a)

to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works
produced in these languages;

The Federal Republic of Germany has not explicitly adopted an obligation in this regard.
General promotion of the cultural interests of the Frisian ethnic group is envisaged as of the
year 2000, within the framework of project-oriented promotion.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
The aim of this obligation is to promote initiatives which are typical of the forms of cultural
expression specific to regional or minority languages.
As in the case of other obligations under Article 12, implementation of this obligation is
accomplished indirectly through Land promotional measures for Frisian institutions.
The local Frisian associations engage in multifarious cultural work, including folksongs and
dancing. They offer language courses and language-learning holidays as well as children's
holiday camps, engage in sports activities where Frisian is spoken, champion Frisian stage
productions, perform tasks in the areas of nature conservation and of the conservation of the
architectural heritage, and operate their own museums of local history and culture.
Of great importance to the cultivation of the Frisian language, culture and history is the
Nordfriisk Instituut (Nordfriesisches Institut - North Frisian Institute) in Bredstedt, as a
central scholarly institution in Nordfriesland. The Institute sees its role as a bridge between
theory and practice, between science and non-specialist research. In particular, its scholarly
and journalistic activities cover the areas of the languages, history, and study of the
geography and civilization of Nordfriesland. It has a specialized library and archives, and
offers seminars, courses, workshops and lectures. The Institute's providing body is the
Verein Nordfriesisches Institut, with a membership of about 850. The work of the Institute is
funded, for the major part, with subsidies provided by Schleswig- Holstein Land. Funding is
also provided by local authorities and by the Danish minority. In addition, own resources are
available in the form of membership dues, donations and sales revenues.
In addition, considerable project funds from the Land Budget and the annual interest
earnings of the projected foundation "Friesenstiftung" , which also can be used for pertinent
measures to implement this obligation, are made available to the Friesenrat e.V. [Frasche
Rädj - Frisian Council].
The local Frisian associations engage in multifarious cultural work. Inter alia, they offer
language courses for adults, organize events for children, champion Frisian stage
productions, maintain traditional costume societies, and on 21 February of every year,
organize the traditional local festival called "Biikebrennen". Some of these projects are
supported with public funds.
In 1993, the Secretariat of Nordfriesischer Verein (North Frisian Association) was moved to
"Andersen-Haus" in Klockries, in Risum- Lindho lm Gemeinde. This Uthland-Frisian farmstead, which is a scheduled monument, was thoroughly renovated with funding provided by
the Land.

123

2. Lower Saxony
The Land of Lower Saxony generally takes a particular interest in promoting initiatives in
the cultural sphere, and especially with regard to the literature of the regional and the
minority languages. Literature and language play a central role in the identification of the
individual and of the community. Thus, the notion of 'language' must not be confined to the
standard language; rather, it also includes a minority language such as Saterland Frisian or
the languages of the other ethnic groups residing here. On this basis, Saterland Frisian
literature can be included in all areas of the promotion of literature (promotion of
production, distribution and reception) in the Land of Lower Saxony. [Applications for]
Promotion of writing and also the publication of literary works by publishing houses of
Lower Saxony are evaluated by an expert jury. So far, no applications [regarding Saterland
Frisian] have been filed - possible reasons being that there are only a little over 2,000
speakers of the Sater Frisian language (of a population of 12,400 inhabitants of the
Saterland, the smallest speech island in Europe) and that the tradition of Saterland Frisian
has beenmainly oral.
In Saterland Gemeinde, the association for the preservation of Saterland local/regional
traditions, Seelter Buund e.V., pursues a wide range of activities for the cultivation of Sater
Frisian and of the culture of the Saterland; in instances, these activities are Landsubsidized.The Ministry of Scientific and Cultural Affairs advises the local authority union
(i.e. Gemeinde Saterland) and the Seelter Buund on the planning of events. For instance, an
Internet project and a Sater Frisian song programme are under preparation.
In addition, Land-subsidized institutions such as the Literaturrat [Literature Council] or the
Literaturbüros [Literature Offices] are encouraged to include Saterland Frisian in their
activities and events. Thus, for instance, a meeting on the ranking and significance of the
literature of the regional or minority languages, with the inclusion of the subject of the Sater
Frisian language, is planned to take place in 2001, the "Year of Languages".

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Access to Works in the Languages –
(b)

to foster the different means of access in other languages to works
produced in regional or minority languages by aiding and
developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling
activities;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
The institutions of the Frisian ethnic group, especially Nordfriisk Instituut (NFI - North
Frisian Institute) in Bredstedt, can make use of promotional funds of Schleswig-Holstein
Land for the translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and dubbing of works into, or in, the
Frisian language. Through its own publishing house and in co-operation with other
publishers, the NFI publishes journals and books in the German and Frisian languages.
In addition, considerable project funds from the Land Budget and the annual interest
earnings of the projected foundation "Friesenstiftung" , which can be used for projects and
publications of all Frisian associations and unions, are made available to the Friesenrat e.V.

124

[Frasche Rädj - Frisian Council]. Such use includes translation, dubbing, postsynchronisation and subtitling of works into, or in, the Frisian language.
In the past, Nordfriisk Instituut, working with Frisian associations and the Nordfriesische
Wörterbuchstelle [North Frisian Dictionary Institute] of Kiel University, fostered the
different means of access, in other languages, to works produced in the North Frisian
language. Thus, for instance, extracts of Frisian- language publications were translated into
other languages (German, Danish, English, Dutch/Flemish, West Frisian). Several books
were pub lished as bilingual editions. The Frisian- language film "Klaar Kiming" ["Clear
Visual Horizon"] was subtitled in German, English and Danish. Occasionally, Frisianlanguage radio broadcasts are dubbed or translated into German. Standard German
translations are enclosed with audio cassettes of Frisian songs. Frisian dictionaries always
give the German and, in part, also the Danish or English equivalents, so as to facilitate
access to the North Frisian language.
2. Lower Saxony
Within the framework of literature promotion, translators are allocated funds for the
translation of literary works. This generally applies to translations both into and from
Saterland Frisian. Also, a grant can be obtained for a study placement at a translators' centre.
The Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch und Saterfriesisch [Workshop for Low German and
Saterland Fris ian] of Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg intensively deals with
research into Saterland Frisian. The Workshop developed a "Sater Frisian Dictionary", the
2nd enlarged edition of which is under preparation. Upon request, the Workshop also offers
translation services.

languages and cultures in the undertakings which they initiate or
for which they provide backing;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
With promotional funds provided by Schleswig-Holstein, the institutions of the Frisian
ethnic group and/or its appointed bodies for the cultural self- manageme nt of the Frisian
ethnic group ensure that appropriate allowance is made for incorporating the knowledge and
use of the North Frisian language and the North Frisian culture in their cultural activities.
Many museums in Nordfriesland Kreis have multilingual inscriptions, including the Frisian
language. In view of the diversity of languages used in Nordfriesland, it is not possible, with
regard to multilingual inscriptions, to make a recommendation that would fit all institutions
involved. Account must be taken of place-specific interests and regional case-by-case
decisions.
2. Lower Saxony
Saterland Gemeinde and the associations and units representing the Saterland Frisian
interests can ensure that appropriate allowance is made for incorporating the knowledge and
use of the Sater Frisian language and the Saterland culture in their cultural activities.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Employment of Staff Proficient in the Language(s) Concerned –

concerned, as well as of the language(s) of the rest of the
population;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
Activities regarding the Frisian culture and language are offered, for the major part, by
institutions, e.g. Nordfriisk Instituut (North Frisian Institute), and associations of the Frisian
ethnic group, which are subsidized by Schleswig-Holstein Land. In additions, Land funds
can be allocated for project promotion on a case-by-case basis. Land-provided subsidies can
also include funds for covering personnel expenses.

In addition, Katholisches Bildungswerk Saterland [Saterland Catholic Educational
Association] offers courses for learning the language or for extending the knowledge of it.
Other planned projects, e.g. the song programme mentioned under paragraph 1,
subparagraph (a), above, serve to consolidate proficiency in the language.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Participation of Representatives of the Group Speaking the Given
Language in Cultural Activities –
(f)

to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
Every two years, Schleswig- Holstein Land organizes the Schleswig-Holstein-Tag [a "day"
dedicated to the special character of the Land] as a central cultural event. The organizations
and associations of the Frisian ethnic group are also invited to participate in this event and to
take part in arranging and organizing it. Through the Schleswig-Holsteinischer Heimatbund
[Schleswig-Holstein Union for Local and Regional Traditions], many North Frisian
local/regional traditions associations are represented on the Landkuratorium SchleswigHolstein-Tag.
Within the framework of [the Hanover World Exposition] EXPO 2000, a total of more than
twenty Danish, German and Frisian libraries have jointly developed a one-week programme
as part of the regional EXPO events in order to give a picture of the library and cultural
scene of the region, which in this form is unique in Germany and Denmark, by organizing
multifarious activities featuring various places and subjects.
2. Lower Saxony
As already stated under paragraphs (d) and (e) above, many full-time and honorary helpers
are involved in the planning and organization of activities/events in the regional language.
Participation in the annual Land festival organized by Lower Saxony, the "Tag der
Niedersachsen" ["Day of the People of Lower Saxony"], is generally possible and has been
encouraged.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Creation of Archive Bodies –
(g)

to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or
publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;

1. Schleswig- Holstein
The Land-subsidized Nordfriisk Instituut (North Frisian Institute) in Bredstedt has a
specialized library as well as archives available for the collection, storage or publication of
works produced in the Frisian language.

127

2. Lower Saxony
Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg employs a specialist for the Saterland Frisian
language, who also carries out extensive documentation work. The Oldenburg University
Library and the Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek in Göttingen have a wide range of Frisian
literature.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Translation and Terminological Research Services –
(h)

if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to
maintaining and developing appropriate administrative, commercial,
economic, social, technical or legal terminology in each regional or
minority language.

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Schleswig-Holstein, implementation of this obligation is indirectly achieved by
promotional funds provided by the Land to the Nordfriisk Instituut (North Frisian Institute)
and for other Frisian organizations. In this regard, cf. also the comments on Article 8 [pp. 95
seqq. above].
Of the total number of nine North Frisian dialects, three - which are spoken by less than 150
persons - are acutely threatened by extinction. The other six dialects are not only used orally
but also exist in written form. Their orthography for the major part is based on uniform
rules. The first book in the North Frisian language was published in 1809. Since then, a
large body of Frisian- language literature has been created, which covers several hundreds of
books and, in addition, several thousands of literary items in a variety of publications. This
ensures that the Frisian language also meets the requirements expected of a modern means
of communication.

re: Art. 12, para. 2
(2)
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow,
encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in
accordance with the preceding paragraph.
In Germany, cultural activities keeping within the framework of the law in force are not
subject to any permit procedure or restrictions. Thus, the above obligation is already
fulfilled by the system of law in the Federal Republic of Germany. More extensive
implementation of this obligation by encouraging or providing such activities will have to
be decided by the Länder on a case-by-case basis.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
Cultural events and activities are offered, if there is a demand for it, outside the Frisian
language area (Nordfriesland Kreis).

128

Participation in the Schleswig-Holstein-Tag, which is held every two years in varying places
of Schleswig-Holstein, also includes associations and groups dressed in traditional costumes
from Nordfriesland. The Landeskuratorium Schleswig-Holstein-Tag and the Land
Government welcome the fullest participation possible of associations, clubs and unions
from the entire Land.
2. Lower Saxony
Pertinent cultural events/activities can be organized outside the Saterland, if there is a
demand for it, for instance on the occasion of meetings on regional or minority languages.
As stated above, partic ipation in the annual "Tag der Niedersachsen" organized in varying
places of the Land is possible.

re: Art. 12, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing
their cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the
cultures they reflect.
1. Schleswig- Holstein
The Frisians do not only live in Schleswig- Holstein, but in the Saterland of Lower Saxony
and in the Netherlands province of Friesland as well. The joint umbrella organization of the
West, East and North Frisians is Interfrasche Rädj e.V. (Interfriesischer Rat - Inter-Frisian
Council). It has 27 members - nine each from its three Friesland Sections (i.e. Sections
North, East, and West). The Inter-Frisian Council has the legal form of an association. Its
headquarters is in the town of Leer in Ostfriesland (Lower Saxony).
Under its Articles of Association, the objectives of the Inter-Frisian Council include the
preservation, promotion and presentation of the Frisian culture and the development and
maintenance of links with Frisians outside West, North and East Friesland.
The Friesenrat Sektion Nord e.V. [Frisian Council - Section North] is supported with funds
of Schleswig-Holstein Land.
2. Lower Saxony
Cf. the preceding comments under no. 1: Schleswig-Holstein.

Article 13
Economic and Social Life
(1)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake
within the whole country:
(a)
to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or
limiting without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority
languages in documents relating to economic or social life,

129

(b)

(c)

particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
to prohibit the insertion - in internal regulations of companies and
private documents - of any clauses excluding or restricting the use
of regional or minority languages, at least between users of the same
language;
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;

The obligations under sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) have been accepted by the Länder of
Schleswig- Holstein and Lower Saxony. They are in compliance with the established law of
the Federal Republic of Germany and thus are fulfilled nation-wide for all regional or
minority languages. Therefore, no special measures had to be taken by these Länder.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Facilitating the Use of the Regional or Minority Language –
(d)

to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority
languages by means other than those specified in the above subparagraphs.

Schleswig- Holstein and Lower Saxony have accepted this obligation.
In Germany, the freedom to use one's own language - both in public and in the private
sphere - is ensured by Article 2, para. 1, of the Basic Law, which guarantees the right to free
development of personality. Use of the minority languages in public is generally accepted
by the German population. There are no reservations in this respect.
The North Frisian language still is to a major extent the language spoken within the family
and the language for communication in public, especially among the Frisians living on the
islands and holms (Halligen). This is less so on the mainland. In mixed- language marriages,
normally Germa n prevails. The use of Sater Frisian by the Saterland Frisians is gradually
increasing since school-children are taking a greater interest in learning this language and
children and the grandparent generation have started to communicate in Saterland Frisia n
again.
There are many and various ways in which the State promotes the learning and use of
minority languages (cf. the comments on the various obligations). In particular, efforts are
encouraged among the general public to keep these languages alive by using them within the
family and in extra- familiar everyday- life situations. In this regard, the cultural value of the
minority languages for Germany's cultural life is particularly emphasized so that, on the
basis of the resultant self- esteem and self- assurance, the younger generation will be more
willing to adopt these languages and pass them on.

130

Article 14
Transfrontier Exchanges
The Parties undertake:
(a)
to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind
them with the States in which the same language is used in identical
or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude such agreements,
in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of the same
language in the States concerned in the fields of culture, education,
information, vocational training and permanent education;
This obligation has been accepted only by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein.
As regards the Frisian language, this obligation is fulfilled by the Framework Convention
for the Protection of National Minorities which entered into force for the Federal Re public
of Germany and for the Kingdom of The Netherlands where, in Friesland Province, the
largest of the existing Frisian language groups live and are protected and promoted by the
State. In both countries, promotion by the State in the Netherlands and in Germany has
helped to establish structures fostering contacts between the users of the same language - i.e.
Frisian, in a wider sense - in the fields listed in sub-para. (a).
On 1 January 1999, the Interfrasche Rädj e.V. (Inter-Frisian Council) was established as the
new joint umbrella organization of the West, East and North Frisians. It is composed of
members from all three Friesland regions, and organizes the Friesenkongress in a three-year
sequence. The North Frisian organizations work together within the Frasche Rädj, Sektion
Nord e.V. (Frisian Council - Nordfriesland Section) which is supported with funds provided
by Schleswig- Holstein Land.
In the Ems-Dollart Region [Eems-Dollard Regio], the municipalities, districts, Chambers [of
local or regional authorities] and other corporations under public law in the Netherlands
Provinces of Groningen and Drenthe and in the German Landkreise of Aurich, Leer and
Wittmund, the municipality of Emden in Ostfriesland and in Emsland Landkreis have
formed a special pur pose association [community syndicate], which in addition to economic
co-operation, also has the task to promote, support and co-ordinate the cultural affairs of this
overall region in a transfrontier context. The Ems-Dollart Region covers large parts of the
East Frisians' settlement area and peripheral areas of the West Frisians so that cultural cooperation also covers the affairs of these groups. Frisians, as representatives of the local
government bodies concerned, directly participate in this co-operation.

131

As of: 13 September 2000

Romany
Article 8
Education
The Central Council [of German Sinti and Roma] and other associations of Sinti and Roma
take the view that, also out of regard for the experience undergone by the survivors of the
genocide, Romany4 should neither be taught nor learnt by non-Sinti/non-Roma within the
public educational system.
A different position is taken by other Roma associations which come out in favour of the
inclusion of Romany in school education and wish to support measures, like those taken in
European neighbouring countries, for the development of a written form of this language.
The Central Council of German Sinti and Roma favours supplemental instruction for
interested children of German Sinti and Roma, where teachers coming from the minority
deal with school subjects in the Romany language so that the children's knowledge of
Romany will be enhanced. Within the Länder, however, only limited numbers of teachers
with sufficient language proficiency are available. The Central Council also favours
language courses for members of the minority on a private basis and as part of adult
education, to be carried out by teachers coming from the minority. Other Sinti organizations
see imparting of their mother tongue Romany - also in this field - as the exclusive
responsibility of the families and family clans of the Sinti community.
Use of the Romany language in the publicly maintained school system is confined, for the
reasons already given, to pilot projects for children of German and foreign Roma in those
cases where larger numbers of them live close to each other. The organizations of German
Sinti and Roma set great store by having the existing State-run and (State-)acknowledged
system of schools and education used for the children of the German Sinti and Roma
without any limitation as has been the case so far. The Central Council of German Sinti and
Roma and other organizations therefore object to separate schools or school classes for Sinti
and Roma only. Therefore, they consider State-promoted measures for the preserva tion and
promotion of Romany to be the sole responsibility of the minority itself. Obviously this also
is the parents' wish since the children of the German Sinti and Roma go to local regular
and/or secondary schools.
Special possibilities, which are also designed to include the cultural traditions and the language of this group, exist for promoting the schooling progress of Sinti and Roma children
in some Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany, for instance in Baden-Wurttemberg,
Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia, and SchleswigHolstein; in instances these activities are part of local projects. The related projects are
carried out at primary, secondary modern and secondary technical schools. The experience
gained in this context has shown that, on a long-term basis, only those initiatives will be
successful which are launched locally with the consent, will and participation, including
shared responsibility, of the persons concerned. In the field of teacher follow-up training, in
4

a non-territorial minority language; territorial scope: Federal Republic of Germany

132

particular, regional efforts increasingly focus on taking account of the concerns and interests
of the pupils who come from Sinti and Roma families.
Paragraph 1
(1)
With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory
in which such languages are used, according to the situation of each of
these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official
language(s) of the State:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Pre-School Education –
(a)

(i)
to make available pre-school education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or

Both obligations have been accepted by the Land of Berlin.
At the request of the Berlin/Brandenburg Land Association of German Sinti and Roma,
acceptance of these obligations by the Land of Berlin will be withdrawn at a later time.
(iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii
above at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose
number is considered sufficient; or
This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Hesse.
Wishes to this effect have not yet been put to the Land by members of the minority/language
group.
As of January 2001, the Federal Government will allocate funds to the Documentation and
Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma in Heidelberg for establishing an "Education
Section" to be staffed with two employees. The cross-Land tasks of this Section will include
the development of materials for the supplemental homework-assistance and language
classes to be taught by teachers coming from this minority/language group for interested
children and, in addition, encouragement to introduce such courses in Romany also in
Hesse. The Hessian Land Association of German Sinti and Roma will take part in these
efforts. The Land Government will co-ordinate the assignment/employment of suitable
teachers with these organizations. In the view of the Land Government, 8 to 10 participants
coming from this minority/language group will be sufficient to warrant the introduc tion of a
pertinent course. This also goes for the area of adult eduction.
(a)

(iv)
if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of pre-school education, to favour and/or encourage the
application of the measures referred to under i to iii above;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
The unqualified right to admission to a nursery school, which has been in force under
Federal law since 1 January 1999, generally applies also to the children of Sinti and Roma.

133

This claim is to be met by the providing bodies of the responsible public child and youth
services (Stadtkreise [munic ipalities] and Landkreise [rural administrative districts]).
As a rule, the children's day-care centres maintained by local authorities and by providing
bodies of private-sector child and youth services do not offer the Romany language.
However, this does not rule out that, if there is a demand for this, the providing body of a
nursery school could employ tutors/tutoresses for imparting the Romany language.
The amended regulation on nursery school promotion, which entered into force as of 1
January 1999, does rule out the use of this type of staff. If professional staff are not
available in sufficient numbers for attending to such a group, as laid down in the BadenWurttemberg Act on Nursery Schools, also other persons (non-professional staff) may be
employed for Romany language instruction. To this extent, the providing bodies of nursery
schools have their own responsibility for staffing matters. The Land cannot exert any
influence in this respect.
2. Hesse
In this regard, cf. the comments on paragraph 1, sub-para. (a) (iii), above.
3. Rhineland-Palatinate
So far, no wishes to this effect have been put to the Land by members of this
minority/language group.
4. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg has adopted paragraph (a) (iv) as a voluntary
commitment. So far, the Land has not received any pertinent wishes expressed by members
of this language group.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Primary Education –
(b)

(i)
to make available primary education in the relevant regional
or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of primary education in
the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within primary education, for the teaching of the
relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of the
curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose number
is considered sufficient;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
The Land has not explicitly adopted the obligation under sub-paragraph (b).
So far, no requirements regarding instruction in the minority language Romany have been
notified. Trained teachers able to give such instruction are not available. In Baden-

134

Wurttemberg, the children of Sinti and Roma are integrated into the regular classes. In
Heidelberg, a Land-subsidized advisory service of the Land Association of German Sinti
and Roma is available for giving guidance to teachers and to parents. In addition, cooperation is pur sued with the school psychological [child guidance] services of the Land.
Additional financial support has been promised to the Land Association.
By letter of 5 June 2000, the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs promised that, in
cases where such a demand exists, Romany classes supplementing regular instruction (e.g.
homework assistance or language instruction) - to comprise two 2-hour periods per week
(for groups comprising 8 - 10 pupils) - will be offered on the basis of the LehrbeauftragtenModell [Temporary/Substitute Instructors Model] at two or three sites (e.g.
Heidelberg/Mannheim area, Ravensburg).
2. Berlin
Berlin has accepted the obligations under sub-paragraph (b) (i) to (iv).
At the request of the Berlin/Brandenburg Land Association of German Sinti and Roma, the
acceptance of the obligations under sub-paragraph (b) (i) to (iii) by the Land of Berlin will
be withdrawn at a later time.
The obligation under sub-paragraph (b) (iv) will be implemented only if and where the
language group so requests. This wish has not been expressed during the period under
review.
3. Hesse
The Land of Hesse has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (b) (iv).
In this regard, cf. the comments on paragraph 1, sub-para. (a) (iii), above.
4. Free and Hanseatic City of Hambur g
Hamburg has accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (b) (iv).
Since 1992, Hamburg has made contracts of employment with Roma and Sinti to fill
positions based on the separate job description "Roma and Sinti as Teachers and Social
Workers".
At seven schools in Hamburg (one elementary school and six secondary modern schools and
Realschulen [secondary technical schools]), Romany is offered by four Roma teachers and
Roma school social workers. Teaching in the mother tongue is integrated into regular
instruction, by having Roma teach the classes with the support of a team partner. Part of the
educational materials are bilingual. In this regard, care is taken to include the history and the
literature of the Roma and Sinti.
Another focus of the educational work with Roma children is musical education. If they so
wish, children can take part in dancing, singing and guitar lessons and are familiarized with
the various forms of Roma and Sinti music. Also non-Roma can take part in this musical
education.

135

In addition, if the parents and children so wish, small learning groups are taught in the
mother tongue. Parent-teacher talks are also conducted in Romany, as are all guidance talks
with pupils and with parents.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Secondary Education –
(c)

(i)
to make available secondary education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of secondary education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within secondary education, for the teaching of
the relevant regional or minority languages as an integral part of
the curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils who, or where appropriate whose families, so
wish in a number considered sufficient;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
None of the obligations under sub-paragraph (c) has been explicitly adopted by this Land.
In this regard, cf. the comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iv), above.
2. Hesse
In this regard, cf. the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (a) (iii).
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In this regard, cf. the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iv), above.
re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Technical and Vocational Education –
(d)

(i)
to make available technical and vocational education in the
relevant regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of technical and vocational education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to provide, within technical and vocational education, for the
teaching of the relevant regional or minority languages as an
integral part of the curriculum; or
(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils who, or where appropriate whose families, so
wish in a number considered sufficient;

1. Hesse
In this regard, cf. the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (a) (iii), above.

136

2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Hamburg has newly adopted this obligation. No information is available on any experience
gained in this respect.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - University and Other Higher Education –
(e)

(i)
to make available university and other higher education in
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to provide facilities for the study of these languages as
university and higher education subjects; or

The obligations under sub-paragraph (e) (i) to (ii) have been accepted by Berlin.
At the request of the Land Association of German Sinti and Roma, acceptance of these
obligations will be withdrawn at a later time.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) iii
(iii) if, by reason of the role of the State in relation to higher
education institutions, sub-paragraphs i and ii cannot be applied, to
encourage and/or allow the provision of university or other forms of
higher education in regional or minority languages or of facilities
for the study of these languages as university or higher education
subjects;
1. Baden-Wurttemberg
Baden-Wurttemberg has notified adoption of this provision in the sense of "undertake ... to
allow" since, in this sense, it is met under the established law with reference to the freedom
of science and research, as guaranteed under Article 5, para. 3, of the Basic Law, and to the
autonomy of institutions of higher education* deriving from those constitutional provisions.
2. Berlin
At the request of the Berlin/Brandenburg Land Association of German Sinti and Roma,
acceptance of this obligation by the Land of Berlin will be withdrawn at a later time.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Hamburg has newly adopted this obligation. No information on any experience is yet
available.
4. Hesse
In this regard, reference is made to para. 1, sub-para. (a) (iii), above.

"(3) Art and scholarship, research, and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching ..."

137

5. North Rhine/Westphalia
The Land of North Rhine/Westphalia has notified adoption of this provision in the sense of
"undertake ... to allow" since, in this sense, it is met under the established law with reference
to the autonomy of institutions of higher education* as guaranteed under Article 5, para. 3,
of the Basic Law.
6. Rhineland-Palatinate
Rhineland-Palatinate has notified adoption of this provision in the sense of "undertake ... to
allow" since, in this sense, it is met under the established law with reference to the
autonomy of institutions of higher education* as guaranteed under Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Adult Education –
(iii) if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of adult education, to favour and/or encourage the offering of
such languages as subjects of adult and continuing education;
This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
The provision of sub-para. (f) (iii) is met at the national (i.e. federal) level by the public
funding of the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma since, on the
basis of this funding support and by virtue of the principle of self- management, it is up to
the responsible representatives of this minority/language group, when deciding on the
Centre's activities, to include pertinent measures in the field of adult education and to
implement them within the limits of the overall funds available.
Baden-Wurttemberg, while not having explicitly adopted this obligation, meets the
requirement of this provision by being the only Land co- funding the Documentation and
Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma in Heidelberg, i.e. in the Land of BadenWurttemberg, with a share of 10 % of the Centre's total expenses. This financial support is
seen as an encouragement to offer Ro many as a subject of adult and continuing education.
This funding makes it possible, in the context of self- management, for the responsible
representatives of this ethnic group to adopt, organize and implement adult education
measures when deciding on the activities to be pursued by the Centre.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Teaching of the History and Culture Education –
(g)

to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

This undertaking has been entered into by the Federal Republic of Germany.

138

On acccount of the historical events during the Nazi rule of force, the history and the culture
of the German Sinti and Roma, which is reflected in the Romany language, is included in
school education throughout the Federal Republic.
Given the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the implementation of this
provision is primarily the responsibility of the Länder. In the field of education in the
Länder, promoting the knowledge of the culture, history, languages and religion of the
respective minorities/language groups as well as of the majority population is part of the
curricula of publicly maintained and private schools and of the mandate of the Land Centres
and Federal Centre for Political Education.
As regards imparting of the knowledge of the history and culture of the German Sinti and
Roma who live dispersed in almost all parts of the Federal Republic, the following examples
can be given:
In Hesse, school education includes the history and culture of the Sinti and Roma, as
provided under the framework curricula for schools. On behalf of the Hessian Ministry of
Education and Cultural Affairs and in co-operation with Fritz-Bauer-Intitut, the Hessian
Land Institute for Pædagogics has developed pertinent educational materials. In 1998, the
Hessian Ministry of Culture established the Pädagogisches Büro Nationale Minderheiten:
Sinti und Roma [Educational Bureau for National Minorities: Sinti and Roma] and
integrated it within the Hessian Land Institute for Pædagogics. With the establishment of
this agency, the Land of Hesse wishes to further pursue the course chosen for the
implementation of the tasks resulting from the Framework Convention for the Protection of
National Minorities.
The educational offers by the Land of North Rhine/Westphalia are primarily aimed at
imparting the history and culture of the Sinti and Roma. Thus, for instance, materials for
class instruction and regional follow-up training - which provide information on the culture
group and history of the Sinti and Roma - have been developed, with the participation of the
local Sinti and Roma, in the cities of Hamm and Cologne. The involvement of Roma in
parental counselling in Cologne, in connection with literacy programmes, helps to enhance
the confidence-building process between schools and families.
In Baden-Wurttemberg, the following measures have been agreed by the Ministry of
Education and Cultural Affairs in co-operation with the Baden-Wurttemberg Land
Association of German Sinti and Roma: At the Land Institute for Education and Instruction
in Stuttgart, a Working Group Sinti und Roma in Deutschland [Sinti and Roma in Germany]
is to be established, to co-operate with the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German
Sinti and Roma in Heidelberg. Teachers and educators, representatives of the "Union of
German Sinti and Roma - Baden-Wurttemberg Land Association" and of the Heidelbergbased Documentation and Cultural Centre are represented on this Working Group. The
Working Group is to give new impulses for the inclusion, in school education, of the
history, culture, and suffering of German Sinti and Roma. The Documentation and Cultural
Centre will be included in the number of non-school educational institutions, e.g. with the
task of preparing school trips to Heidelberg. The Land Institute for Education and
Instruction is preparing a brochure to be used in class for analyzing, and attempting to come
to terms with, the history of the Sinti and Roma. In addition, the Land Government
endeavours to induce educational publishing companies to take increased account of the
Sinti and Roma in text books and other educational media.

139

In imparting knowledge of the culture of the majority population and of na tional minorities
and ethnic groups in schools and in the extra-curricular sector, an important role is played
by the public institutions for political education, i.e. the Federal Centre and the Land
Centres [for Political Education]. The materials compiled by these Centres with regard to
issues of the co-existence of the various cultures represented in Germany are used as
instruction material both in schools and in adult education.
Within the Senate Authority for Schools, Youth and Sports in the Land of Berlin, staff
members from both the schools and youth services sectors, deal with the current situation of
Sinti and Roma. They are represented on an interdepartmental Regional Committee.
The provisional Framework Curricula for Education and Instruction at the Berlin Schools
for the subjects 'history' and 'political science' include, of course, the Sinti and Roma in the
treatment and discussion of the Nazi ideology and its enforcement by means of persecution
and extermination. The Berlin schools also avail themselves of the opportunity to invite
Sinti and Roma as external speakers/lecturers. The Berlin Landesbildstelle offers twelve
media units, mainly films, on this subject.
Information on the activities and situation of the German Sinti and Roma is provided by the
Land Government of Schleswig-Holstein primarily through the aforementioned Minority
Report [cf. p. 21], which was published in brochure form.
Information on the persecution of the German Sinti and Roma is provided, for instance, in
the brochures "Nationalsozialismus - Band III" ["National Socialism - Volume III"] and "KZ
Dachau" ["Dachau Concentration Camp"] published by the Bavarian Land Centre for
Political Education. Also, the Land Centre plans to publish, in 2001, a general survey of the
culture, history, language and religion of the German Sinti and Roma, which will be made
available to all public institutions and to schools. Also, it is planned to discuss further
measures at the forthcoming meetings of the competent expert commissions, where the
content of the various subjects covered by the teacher examination regulations will be
revised. In addtion, the new curricula place greater emphasis than before on intercultural
education, especially with regard to primary and secondary modern schools. This is also to
include treatment of the language, culture, history and religion of the German Sinti and
Roma.
In Hamburg Land, political education activities increasingly provide for public information
regarding the history and identity of this minority traditionally resident in Germany. Thus in
Hamburg, a number of books and brochures have been published on the subject of the living
together of different cultures and nationalities; among these is the publication entitled "Wir
sprechen viele Sprachen" ["We speak many languages"] (a reading book with picture
writing, which is also used as a first reader in classes attended by Roma). In addition, the
Hamburg Senate has published a brochure entitled "Roma and Sinti in Hamburg" which is
designed to foster understanding of the culture and history of the Roma and Sinti in
Hamburg.
The Lower Saxon Land Centre for Political Education, within the framework of activities
related to memorial sites, deals with the history of the persecution of the Sinti and Roma
during the Nazi era. It holds meetings on this subject, and carries out research on the fate
suffered by the Sinti and Roma in the concentration camp of Bergen-Belsen. Discrimination
against the Sinti and Roma in post-war Germany was the subject of several meetings which
also dealt with matters related to indemnification for wrongs suffered during the Nazi era.

140

In the Land of Baden-Wurttemberg, a brochure entitled "Zwischen Romantisierung und
Rassismus: Sinti and Roma 600 Jahre in Deutschland" ["Between romanticizing and
racism: 600 years of Sinti and Roma living in Germany"] was published in November 1998
jointly by the Baden-Wurttemberg Land Centre for Political Education and the Union of
German Sinti and Roma - Baden-Wurttemberg Land Association. It contains contributions
from writers and scholars, and is first of all intended for teachers and for professionals in
adult education. It is to impart the basic and background knowledge that helps to counter the
development of prejudices and to develop and raise public awareness.
The Rhineland-Palatinate Land Centre for Political Education has, together with the State
Pædagogical Centre, developed educational materials on the subject of "Sinti and Roma Eine deutsche Minderheit" ["Sinti and Roma - A German minority"]. A key feature of these
materials is that, rather than developing a "minority science" [a body of knowledge about
minorities] as seen from the perspective of the majority population, the perspectives of both
the majority and the minority are represented to the same extent.
The Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung (BpB - Federal Centre for Political Education)
also has intensively dealt with this subject- matter, especially in various publications of the
series "Informationen zur politischen Bildung" ["Information on Political Education"] which
reach a large number of teachers/educators and other multipliers.
The Federal Government and the Länder endeavour to further improve the education and
information currently offered, outside the traditional settlement areas, on the subject of
national minorities and ethnic groups. The national minorities and ethnic groups regard the
education/information activities outside the central settlement areas as insufficient and, in
particular, miss a nation-wide survey concerning the four [minority language] groups
concerned.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Basic and Further Training of Teachers –
(h)

to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;

This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
As regards the general situation of Romany in a school context and the realization of the
self- management principle through the promotion of the Documentation and Cultural
Centre, reference is made to the implementation measures described with regard to Article 8
[p. 121], and to the comments in Part C on Article 8 [p. 43 above]. Also, reference is made
to the detailed description of the information materials regarding the culture and history of
this minority/language group, which are used for teacher following-up training and are
included as educational material in school instruction.
In teacher follow- up training, in particular, coverage of the interests of this
minority/language group has become a regional focus.
Various schools in Hamburg, with a larger share of Roma children, have Roma employed as
teachers and/or school social workers. The Teacher Follow-up Training Institute organizes
follow-up training for Roma working at Hamburg schools.

141

Since 1993, the Institut für Lehrerfortbildung [Teacher Follow-up Training Institute] in
Hamburg has promoted and supported school education of Roma and Sinti children. This
includes:
- conceptual development of school programmes for Roma and Sinti children;
- follow-up training of teachers and of Roma employed in schools;
- development of educational material;
- production of an information film on school- related issues, also in the language of the
German Sinti and Roma, for Roma and Sinti parents;
- counselling for parents, pupils, schools and the competent authority.
In Hesse, the aforementioned Pädagogisches Büro Nationale Minderheiten: Sinti und Roma
[Educational Bureau for National Minorities: Sinti and Roma] offers follow-up training for
teachers and supports projects carried out by schools. As a first step, the subjects relating to
the history and present-day life of the Sinti and Roma and to anti-Gypsy attitudes were
incorporated in the framework currricula for sociology, history and social studies, which
were adopted in 1995. Subsequently, under a 2-year project, educational materials were
developed for history instruction which were made available to schools in the 1998/99
school year. At present, the Bureau is working on material designed for teachers on the
subject of "Sinti and Roma in films - Information on documentaries and feature films". One
example of a larger-scale project is the "Zeitzeugenprojekt" ["Contemporary Witness
Project"] referring to events during the Nazi era, which is carried out jointly by the newly
founded Marburg-based Gesellschaft für Antiziganismusforschung [Society for the Study of
Anti-Gypsy Attitudes] and by institutions of the Netherlands and of Israel. The
establishment of the Bureau is the third step of the envisaged fundamental educational
concept, within the framework of the Hessian Schools Act of 1997, for the inclusion of the
history and culture of the Sinti and Roma in school education.
The Educational Bureau is to create, in the Hessian schools, the conditions for introducing
the history and present-day life of the Sinti and Roma, the subject of anti- Gypsy attitudes
and the culture of the Sinti and Roma in a form adapted to the respective age groups and
school subjects. Teachers are to be provided with reliable information on this subject matter
which so far has been neglected by scholarly research and which is subject to quite a few
stereotyped ideas. The target group of these awareness-raising efforts is the majority
population so as to reduce information deficits and prejudices on a long-term basis.
Therefore, they are designed to have a Land-wide and regional impact. Follow-up training
for teachers includes lectures and seminars, research and supply of literature, and the
introduction to, and presentation of, newly developed educational material. In addition, the
Bureau gives advice to schools and initiatives and co-ordinates regional and local projects. It
disseminates current research findings and co-operates with scholarly institut ions and with
its counterparts in other Länder and with institution of organizations of the Sinti and Roma.
Events and meetings help to develop a dialogue between the minority and majority
populations.
In North Rhine/Westphalia, similar activities are carried out for teacher follow-up training.
For instruction and regional follow-up training, materials have been developed to provide
information on the culture and history of the Sinti and Roma. A teacher follow- up training
project carried out in Hamm covers the discussion and analysis of the experience made with
the project, and co-operation between various projects and an exchange of experience with
other projects (Hamburg, Bremen, and Denmark and the Netherlands). In addition, the

142

related documentation provides for the information of, and exchanges with, individuals and
groups other than those involved in the projects.
In Lower Saxony, as part of the follow-up training scheme "interkulturelles Lernen"
[intercultural learning], regionally and centrally organized teacher follow- up training
courses are occasionally offered which impart knowlege of cultural, social and historical
aspects of the situation of the Sinti and Roma to teachers, and also offer
didactic/methodological aids in view of promoting schooling progress and integration. The
Lower Saxony Association of German Sinti, as well as local initiatives, are involved in
designing and organizing these follow-up training courses.
In Rhineland-Palatinate, the State Pædagogical Centre and the Land Centre for Political
Education have developed information material on the subject of "Sinti and Roma - a
German Minority". This material is made available to the schools of this Land.
In Bavaria, the central agency for teacher follow- up training continuously deals with the
problems of ethnic linguistic minorities. Current educational objectives are tolerance,
understanding, and respect for linguistic and cultural minorities. Land-organized teacher
follow-up training courses, which also cover intercultural education, regularly deal with
these subjects. This includes follow-up training of teachers with regard to the culture,
history, language and religion of the German Sinti and Roma.
In the Land of Berlin, the Berliner Institut für Lehrerfort- und Weiterbildung und Schulentwicklung (BIL - Berlin Institute for Follow-up and In-Service Training of Teachers and
School Development) orga nizes various follow- up training courses on the subject of
"Intercultural Learning", which include the language group of the Sinti and Roma. As part
of its Working Papers series, the BIL published the "Geschichte der Sinti und Roma in
Deutschland; Darstellung und Dokumente" ["History of the Sinti and Roma in Germany;
Description and Documents"] and, in the series Didaktische Materialien, the volume ent itled
"Von Berlin nach Lodz und Auschwitz, Materialien zum nationalsozialistischen
Massenmord" ["From Berlin to £ódŸ and Auschwitz - Materials on the Nazi-era
Massacre"].

re: para. 1, sub-para. (i) - Supervisory Bodies –
(i)

to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing
the teaching of regional or minority languages and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings which will be made public.

1. Berlin
The prerequisite for the implementation of this provision is that the minority/language group
must, with regard to the obligations under Article 8 of the Charter, specify their
requirements for instruction in the Romany language. As regards the present status, cf. the
pertinent comments on the preceding provisions of Article 8.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg

143

The Hamburg Institut für Lehrerfortbildung (IfL - Teacher Follow- up Training Institute)
also takes care of the counselling of specialized teachers who receive follow-up training or
additional qualification for teaching in the regional language Low German and the minority
language Romany. The Institute keeps a list of the relevant courses offered by Hamburg
schools; information on such activities is given in the periodical "IfL aktuell" ["IfL current
news"].
With regard to any extension required or the qualification of the offered courses, the responsible lecturers of the Institute confer with the supervisory school authorities and with
the 'German La nguage' Section of the Senate Authority for Schools.
3. Hesse
In this regard, reference is made to the above comments under "1. Berlin".
re: Art. 8, para. 2
(2)

With regard to education and in respect of territories other than
those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally
used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or
minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the
appropriate stages of education.

This obligation has been accepted by the Länder of Berlin, Hesse and North Rhine/Westphalia and, as a newly assumed voluntary commitment, by the Free and Hanseatic City of
Hamburg.
As regards colleges and universities, the obligation - in the sense of "undertake ... to allow" is met for the entire territory of the Federal Republic by virtue of Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law (autonomy of institutions of higher education* ).
On account of the situation of this minority/language group in terms of school education, as
discussed in detail in Part C, under Article 8 [p. 43 above], this provision is not of rele vance
in practice.

Article 9
Judicial Authorities
(1)
The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which
the number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies
the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the
present paragraph is not considered by the judge to hamper the proper
administration of justice:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Civil Proceedings –
*

"(3) Art and scholarship, research, and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching ..."

144

(b)

in civil proceedings:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

145

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Proceedings before Courts concerning Administrative Matters –
(c)

in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

Both obligations have been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
With the proviso that documents and evidence drafted in a minority language must be
presented in a form obviating misunderstandings or errors with regard to their translation,
this obligation is met by the legal situation prevailing in Germany. Therefore, no special
measures have been taken.
As regards proceedings before administrative courts, it should be noted that these courts are
obliged to conduct ex officio investigations and, where necessary and appropriate, will on
their own initiative rely on the services of interpreters. Thus, the members of this language
group suffer no prejudice by the use of their language.
For Baden-Wurttemberg, the additional information is provided that, over the past years, the
Ministry of Justice has learnt of only one case where, in civil proceedings, a court contacted
the Ministry of Justice in search of a qualified interpreter for the Romany language, who
was then located with the help of the Bundesverband der Dolmetscher und Übersetzer e.V.
(BDÜ - Federal Association of Interpreters and Translators, reg'd).
Generally, the existing procedural regulations ensure that qualified interpreters will be
called in if a person appearing in court does not have a full command of the German
language, and/or for translating legal documents and evidence submitted in such
proceedings. In its Officia l Gazette, the Baden-Wurttemberg Ministry of Justice has, as a
practical aid, included an interpreter for the Romany language in a list of interpreters for
rarely used languages; at the same time, all courts and Public Prosecutor's Offices were
requested to give the names of interpreters for rarely used languages who are not yet
included on the list.

re: Art. 9, para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Validity of Legal Documents –
(2)

The Parties undertake:
(a)
not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within
the State solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority
language; or

This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany and is met by the
prevailing law in Germany and all of its Länder.

146

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
(1)
Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the
measures specified below and according to the situation of each language,
the Parties undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) v - Submission of Documents –
(a)

(v)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
validly submit a document in these languages;

The obligation under sub-paragraph (a) (v) has been accepted by the Land of SchleswigHolstein.
The legal basis for the adoption of this obligation by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein is Article 82a, para. 2, of the Land Administration Act. This discretionary regulation provides for
the general possibility to submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other documents in
a foreign language, i.e. a language other than the official language.
"Section 82a - Official language
(1) The official language is German.
(2) If applications or petitions, records, deeds or other documents drafted in a foreign
language are submitted to an authority, the latter may require a translation to be produced. (...)"
In a letter (of 16-07-1998) to the Minister-President [of Schleswig- Holstein], the Central
Council of German Sinti and Roma objected to the adoption of this undertaking and asked
for withdrawal of its notification to the Council of Europe. The Central Council obviously
proceeds from the assumption that legal documents drafted in the minority language shall be
(i.e. "must be") submitted to all authorities.
In her reply, the Minister-President stated that acceptance of this obligation was an offer by
the State. It was left to the minority to make use of that offer or not. Since SchleswigHolstein had entered into this undertaking also for its other minority and regional languages,
renunciation, confined to Romany, of the protection afforded under Article 10, para. 1, subpara. (a) (v), might give rise to the allegation that this constitutes a form of discrimination.
At the present time, it is not known whether any use has already been made of the facilities
afforded under this provision.

147

re: Art. 10, para. 2
(2)
In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory
the number of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is
such as to justify the measures specified below, the Parties undertake to
allow and/or encourage:

re: para. 2, sub-para. (b) - Submission of Applications –
(b)
the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to
submit oral or written applications in these languages;
This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein.
The legal basis for the adoption of this obligation by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein is
Article 82a, para. 2, of the Land Administration Act. This discretionary regulation provides
for the general possibility to submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other
documents in a foreign language, i.e. a language other than the official language.
"Section 82a - Official language
(1) The official language is German.
(2) If applications or petitions, records, deeds or other documents drafted in a foreign
language are submitted to an authority, the latter may require a translation to be
produced. (...)"
Schleswig- Holstein has accepted this provision for Low German and Romany. After this
had been notified to the Council of Europe, the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma,
in a letter (of 16-07-1998) to the Minister-President, objected to the acceptance of this
obligation and requested the withdrawal of its notification to the Council of Europe.
As regards use of the Romany language in dealings with public authorities, it should be
pointed out that the German Sinti and Roma see Romany as a language used within the
families and family clans of the Sinti and Roma. In their dealings with German authorities,
they use the German language and object to their language being learnt and used by
administrative officials who are not members of this minority. However, the German Sinti
and Roma wish that there should be no problems involved in the use of Romany in contacts
of Sinti and Roma as administrative staff members, on the one hand, and as citizens seeking
advice, on the other.
In view of the fact that the German Sinti and Roma grow up as bilingual speakers of
Romany and German and, as a rule, have full command of both languages, the need to use
Romany in relations with administrative authorities has not yet emerged.

148

re: para. 2, sub-paras. (e) and (f) - Use by Regional and Local Authorities of the Minority
Language in Debates in Their Assemblies –
(e)
the use by regional authorities of regional or minority
languages in debates in their assemblies, without excluding,
however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;
(f)
the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages
in debates in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use
of the official language(s) of the State;
These obligations have been accepted by the Land of Hesse.
In a press release on the decision taken by the Land Government on 14 July 1998, it was
pointed out that speeches in the Romany language may be made in the assemblies of local
authorities. In this context, reference was made to debates conducted, on several occasions,
in the German Bundestag. In the view of the Hessian Land Government, recognition of
minority rights of Hessian Sinti and Roma and the entry into force of the anti-discrimination
provisions of the Regional/Minority Language Charter and of the Framework Convention
for the Protection of National Minorities will ge nerate a growing interest and facilitate
representation, through democratic parties, on local councils and regional parliaments. If
two or more members of the national minority are represented on such councils/assemblies
and occasionally use their language, use of that language is admissible under the
Regional/Minority Language Charter. As required, the German version of statements in that
language is to be included in the minutes.

re: Art. 10, para. 3
(3)
With regard to public services provided by the administrative
authorities or other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake,
within the territory in which regional or minority languages are used, in
accordance with the situation of each language and as far as this is
reasonably possible:
re: para. 3, sub-paras. (c) - Requests in the Minority Language
(c)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a
request in these languages.
This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Hesse.
In administrative practice, no request to this effect has yet been submitted by a member of
this minority.

149

re: Art. 10, para. 4
(4)
With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the
following measures:

re: para. 4, sub-para. (c) - Appointment of Public Service Employees having a Knowledge
of a Regional or Minority Language –
(c)

compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to
be appointed in the territory in which that language is used.

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
If there is any relevant demand and if a staff member within the Land Administration
expresses a wish regarding such an appointment, the scope for complying with the request
will be examined. So far, however, there have been no requests to this effect at the level of
the supreme Land authorities.
2. Hesse
So far, no requests to this effect have been made by public service employees.
3. Schleswig- Holstein
With a view to implementing this obligation, an announcement to this effect was made at
the Personalreferentenkonferenz (PRK - Conference of Personnel Officers) on 24 June
1999. The PRK brings together the personnel officers of the supreme Land authorities at
regular meetings with the aim of co-ordinating and harmonizing the essential crossdepartmental decisions in the field of personnel management.
If a staff member within the Land Administration expresses a wish regarding such an appointment, the scope for complying with the request will be examined. So far, however,
there have been no requests to this effect at the level of the supreme Land authorities.

re: Art. 10, para. 5
(5)
The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names
in the regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.
This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany. In this regard, reference is made to the comments in Part C above on Article 10 [pp. 44 seq.].

150

Article 11
Media
(1)
The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority
languages within the territories in which those languages are spoken,
according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public
authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role
in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Radio Broadcasting –
(b)

(i)
to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one
radio station in the regional or minority languages; or

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Berlin.
There are no legal provisions preventing implementation of this provision. However, the
minority/language group so far has not made any use of this possibility so that this provision
is not of relevance in practice.
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
1. Berlin
In view of ensuring pluralism of opinions among approved private broadcasters, Article 20,
para. 1, of the State Treaty between the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg on Co-operation
in the Field of Broadcasting of 29 February 1992 stipulated the following: "The private
broadcasters licensed in the area of application of this State Treaty shall reflect the essence
of the plurality of opinions in the contents of their programmes. The relevant political,
philosophical/ideological and social actors and groups shall be given adequate scope for
expressing their opinions in the respective generalist (overall) programmes and in specialist
(thematic) programmes with a focus on information; opinions of minorities shall be taken
account of."
The State Treaty between the Länder of Berlin and Brandenburg on Co-operation in the
Field of Broadcasting also laid down a provision on "minority programmes". Section 45 of
the State Treaty reads as follows: "In statutes adopted by it, the Media Council can lay down
the overall conditions for experimental programmes on a cable TV channel and an FM
broadcasting channel, in which special account is taken of the interests of minorities. If in
that context foreign- language programmes are planned, the overall programme shall foster
the living together of foreigners and the German population in Berlin and Brandenburg.
Before adopting statutes, the Land supervisory authority for private broadcasters [MABB]
will, in co-operation with the Land public-service broadcasting corporations, identify the
demand for such programmes and study the scope for developing them."

151

The Berlin-based radio station SFB 4 Multikulti* , which also broadcasts a programme in the
Romany language of the Roma of South Eastern Europe (every first and third Thursday of
the month, at 18.45 - 19.00 hours), addresses this programme mainly to Roma living in the
Greater Berlin region and, in particular, to foreign Roma.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
There are no special offers for Romany at present. As regards the practical possibilities
generally existing for this language group, reference is made to the comments in Part C on
Article 11 [pp. 46 seqq. above].
3. Hesse
In the Land of Hesse, Section 13, para. 1, of the Gesetz über den privaten Rundfunk [Act on
Private Broadcasters] stipulates that programmes shall contribute "to the protection of
ethnic, cultural and linguistic minorities".
4. Schleswig- Holstein
In a letter of 29 September 1999, the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Land has
encouraged the station programme directors of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Zweites
Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television, or Channel II),
DeutschlandRadio, Radio Schleswig-Holstein (R.SH), NORA (NordOstseeRAdio), delta
radio and POWER RADIO Nord to integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the
features determining the specificity of our Land" in their programmes; intensification of first
action already taken in this respect wo uld be welcomed. In the spirit of the
Regional/Minority Language Charter, the Minister-President urged that "further avenues
should be explored for integrating contributions in the minority languages and in the
regional language Low German into their programmes, as a service for the citizens and in
support of this element of the culture of Schleswig- Holstein".
Since the German Sinti and Roma minority use, and pass on, their language only within the
family and their minority, radio broadcasts in Romany are not to be expected for the time
being; or at any rate, the Land Government does not know of any such plans.
In addition, the following provisions have been laid down:
Ÿ The broadcasting corporation under public law (Norddeutscher Rundfunk - NDR) has the
legal mandate to report on the cultural diversity and the special features of the respective
Land and to give its support to the protection of minorities.
Ÿ ...
Ÿ Programming principles for private broadcasting: "programmes shall help to ... achieve
protection and promotion of minorities".
Ÿ Protected minorities have access to the media, and scope for participation, on the same
conditions as other groups of society. The provisions of the Land Broadcasting Act
promote programming diversity and the variety of broadcasters.
Ÿ The Land Broadcasting Act was amended in 1999. In future, the previous Assembly of
the supervisory authority Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR - the
Schleswig- Holstein Land broadcasting institution for private broadcasters) will be
replaced by a Media Council. Any socially relevant group, organization or association of
*

SFB = Sender Freies Berlin; "Multikulti" colloquially refers to "multicultural" [T's Note]

152

supraregional stand ing is entitled to make nominations for the election of the Media
Council.
Ÿ In addition, the ULR operates two radio broadcasting 'Open Channels' in Schleswig- Holstein. Through these Open Channels, anybody who is not a broadcaster himself, can
disseminate his or her own contributions via radio broadcasting.

The Land Government will inform the Hesse-based Hessischer Rundfunk (HR) of the
obligations entered into under sub-paras. (b) (ii) and (c) (ii) and, while observing the the
constitutional rule of go vernmental non- intervention, is prepared to initiate a dialogue
between the Hesse Land Association of German Sinti and Roma and the Hessian
Landesrundfunkanstalt [Land public service broadcasting corporation]. The Central Council
of German Sinti and Roma has pointed out to the Land Government that in the Council's
view, programmes with Sinti and Roma music might be a possibility.
4. Rhineland-Palatinate
In Rhineland-Palatinate, individuals and groups can, on their own responsibility, broadcast
television programmes over the so-called 'Open Channel'. It is not known whether any

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of
audio and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
As regards the production of such works and their dissemination outside the broadcasting
sector, State promotion of the Documentation Centre of German Sinti and Roma meets this
provision. On the basis of this funding support and by virtue of the principle of self- management, it is up to the responsible representatives of this minority/language group in this
institution, when deciding on the Centre's activities, to decide on the adoption of pertinent
measures and to implement them within the limits of the overall funds available.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Newspaper Articles –
There is little scope for state action/influence on account of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp. 46
seqq. above]).
Publication of print media in the Romany language would be against the fundamental view
of the German Sinti that their language should be used within their families and family clans
only, and that no written form should be developed. However, the Documentation and
Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma regularly disseminates articles and comments in
German which are released to the press and also are made available to its affiliated
associations for information. Other organizations of the German Sinti and Roma as well
provide information through information services and/or circulars. Roma organizations also
use their Romany for this purpose. The Documentation and Cultural Centre publishes a
series of booklets (in German).
(e)

(i)
to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or
maintenance of at least one newspaper in the regional or minority
languages; or

1. Berlin
In the Land of Berlin, the journal "Romano Lil" is published by the Romani Union
Berlin/Brandenburg for the third year already. The articles are written in Romany and
German. The journal is subsidized with funds of the European Commission.
2. Hesse

154

So far, the members of the minority in this Land have not expressed any intention to create
their own journal.
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper
articles in the regional or minority languages on a regular basis;
1. Federal Republic of Germany
As regards the Romany language, the provision of subpara. (e) (ii) is met by the State
promotion of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma and of the Documentation and
Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma. On the basis of the State promotion of the press
activities of the two institutions and under the principle of self- management, it is for the
responsible representatives of this ethnic group in the two institutions to decide on the
release of articles in Romany to the press and to disseminate them within the framework of
the overall funds available.
2. Berlin
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on sub-para. (e) (i), above.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) ii - Financial Assistance for Audiovisual Productions –
(ii)
to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to
audiovisual productions in the regional or minority languages;
This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
Direct financial assistance by the State is problematic, due to the freedom of broadcasting
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp.
46 seqq. above]).
This provision is met, as regards the Romany language, by the State promotion of the
Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma since, on the basis of such
promotion and under the principle of self- management, it is up to the responsible
representatives of the ethnic group in this institution to use the available public funds also
for audiovisual productions.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Training of Journalists –
(g)

to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using
regional or minority languages.

This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
The State promotion of the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma
meets this provision with regard to the Romany language. On the basis of such promotion
and under the principle of self- management, it is up to the responsible representatives of the
ethnic group in this institution to use such public funds also for basic and follow-up training

155

and/or to organize other professional follow- up training with regard to the use of the
minority language.

re: Art. 11, para. 2 - Freedom of Direct Reception of Broadcasts, and Freedom of
Expression –
(2)
The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language
used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and
not to oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in such a language. They further undertake to
ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise
of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
As regards the fundamental conditions governing freedom of expression and reception of
broadcasts, reference is also made to the detailed comments in Part C above on Article 11
[pp. 46 seqq.]. Within the limits of the law as described in Part C, this obligation is met by
constitutional provisions and ordinary laws in Germany.

Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
(1)
With regard to cultural activities and facilities - especially libraries,
video libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres
and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular
forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including
inter alia the use of new technologies - the Parties undertake, within the
territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
As regards the general State promotional measures, reference is made to the comments in
Part A, no. 4.3.4, above [p. 17].

156

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Types of Expression, and Access to Works in the Languages –
(a)

to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works
produced in these languages;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
Baden-Wurttemberg meets this obligation by promoting the Documentation and Cultural
Centre of German Sinti and Roma. In this way, the Centre can launch initiatives which are
typical of the forms of cultural expression specific to the minority language Romany, and it
can facilitate access to relevant works by providing, in particular, its own publications.
2. Berlin
As in the case of other obligations under Article 12, implementation of this obligation is
accomplished indirectly by Land promotion of the Land Association of German Sinti and
Roma. For specific cultural activities, the Senate Authority for Cultural Affairs makes additional funds available to the Land Association.
In 1990, the Land Association established a social services/youth work Counselling Bureau.
The staff members of this Bureau are Sinti. Its main tasks are social counselling and general
assistance with the enforcement of indemnification claims of victims of the Nazi regime
who are members of this national minority. In addition, awareness-raising activities forming
part of school and out-of-school education and adult education, or presented at public
events, are carried out with the aim of providing basic information about Sinti and Roma in
order to reduce misconceptions and prejudices.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Through its Senate Authority for Cultural Affairs, Hamburg assists cultural initiatives and
artists of minorities, including Sinti and Roma, in the organization of cultural projects and
events. The aim is to help minorities with the preservation and further development of their
culture. Priority is given to promoting intercultural projects, i.e. projects involving, or
reaching out to, people from different backgrounds.
4. Hesse
The Land Government has declared its willingness to foster the means of access to works
produced in the Romany language, with regard to cultural institutions and activitites, especially libraries, cultural centres, museums, theatres, and literary works and film produc tions.
5. Lower Saxony
The Land of Lower Saxony sees literature and language as an essential element of the
identification of the individual and the community. Therefore, the Land subsidizes many
associations and unions, with various activities designed to cultivate their minority language
which is spoken in the Land of Lower Saxony. The Ministry of Scientific and Cultural
Affairs is interested in promoting initiatives in the area of culture, especially literature. The

157

Ministry encourages relevant events. Thus, a meeting on the ranking and significance of the
literature in the regional or minority languages will be held in the course of the year 2000.
The focus of the above activities is on the the regional language Low German. No
applications have so far been filed for promotion of Romany. In talks with the organizers of
events, the Land regularly points out the existing and necessary scope for implementation
with regard to the Romany language.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
Since 1993, this Land has provided financial promotion for the Roma "Pralipe" Theatre in
Mülheim/Ruhr. By giving guest performances of stage plays - which comprise elements of
both the Romany language of their home country and the Romany of the German Sinti and
Roma - in Germany and neighbouring countries, this theatre company, which originally was
domiciled in what now is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, helps to preserve
essential elements of the identity of Roma and Sinti, such as language, tradition and cultural
heritage. Special grants by the Land Government in 1998 have enabled the "Pralipe"
Theatre to go on an additional tour of guest performances to present its plays to a larger
audience. With the support of the Land it is possible to present the types of expression
specific to the respective languages and to foster access to works produced in those
languages.
Here, it should be pointed out that the Pralipe Theatre in October 1998 received the Lorca
Award of the International Institute of Mediterranean Theatre. At the same time, the
Theatre, together with the North Rhine/Westphalia Ministry of Education and Cultural
Affairs, was awarded a prize by this Institute for their commitment in fighting xenophobia.
7. Rhineland-Palatinate
In Rhineland-Palatinate, as part of the overall cultivation of culture, the Sinti and Roma
"Aven" festival, which is regularly held in Landau, is supported with funds of the registered
association "Kultursommer e.V.".
Since 1999, the Land Association of German Sinti and Roma has received institutional
promotional funds which are also used for promoting the Romany language.
8. Schleswig- Holstein
Implementation of this obligation is primarily accomplished indirectly by the Land
promotion of the Secretariat and the Advisory Bureau of the Land Association of German
Sinti and Roma in Kiel.
To give a specific example: in 1997, the Ministry for Education, Science, Research and
Cultural Affairs and the Land Association of German Sinti and Roma organized an expert
meeting within the framework of a cultural project. Sinti and Roma from several European
countries discussed issues related to the self-perception and the culture of the Sinti and
Roma as well as aspects of any potential loss, or preservation, of culture. The meeting was
also attended by representatives from other national minorities and ethnic groups of the
Land of Schleswig-Holstein. The Official Residence for Guests of the Land Government
was made available for the duration of the expert meeting. The meeting concluded with a
musical programme.

158

Since 1998, a specific title (departmental budget of the Ministry for Education, Science,
Research and Cultural Affairs) of the Land Budget has been assigned to the cultural work of
the German Sinti and Roma.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Taking Account of the Regional or Minority Language in Cultural
Activities –
(d)

to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for
incorporating the knowledge and use of regional or minority
languages and cultures in the undertakings which they initiate or
for which they provide backing;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
This obligation is met by the Land co- funding the Documentation and Cultural Centre of
German Sinti and Roma in Heidelberg, with a share of 10 % of the Centre's total expenses.
2. Berlin
The Berlin Senate established the cultural centre Werkstatt der Kulturen (WdK Multicultural Workshop) in 1993, and since then has provided funds on an annual basis. The
WdK is an encounter centre for people of different nationalities, cultural backgrounds or
religions. Here, artists, clubs and associations, and initiatives are given 'space', technology
and guidance for their own social, cultural or political activities; this offer is also used by
Sinti and Roma. Thus, for instance, two groups of Roma artists presented music, dances and
poems of the Roma on two stages at street parties. The two Berlin-based associations of
Sinti and Roma have exchanges with the WdK. Since March 1999, the Romani Union Berlin
has organized a series of readings under the motto "Die Welt der Roma-Literatur" ["The
World of Roma Literature"]. In 2000, the first book of a planned series was published by the
Romani Union with the support of the European Commission: the book entitled
"Ausgegrenzt" ["Marginalized"] by Josef Müller.
3. Free and Hanseatic Cit y of Hamburg
The Hamburg Senate Authority for Cultural Affairs, in handling applications for support for
Romany literary projects, gives equal priority to such projects and to those related to
standard German and Low German. However, hardly any applicatio ns for literature
promotion have been filed. In addition, though, the 'Intercultural Projects' Section of the
Authority has an additional mandate also in the field of Romany and encourages the
organizations receiving funding to take special account of the Romany language.
4. Hesse
The Hesse Land Government promotes the cultural work of the Hessian Land Association
of German Sinti and Roma. In co-operation with that Land Association, events were held
under the motto "ROM SOM" covering the tradition of the poetry, music and narrative art of
the Sinti and Roma (at Museumszentrum in Lorsch on 28 May 1999; in Darmstadt on 20
August 1999; and in Rodgau on 31 October 1999). Further cultural activities referring to the

159

history and literature of the Sinti and Roma were organized by the Land Association at the
Frankfurt Literaturhaus on 5 March 1999 and in Wiesbaden on 30 January and 23
September 1999.
5. Lower Saxony
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "5. Lower
Saxony", above.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
With the funding of the Pralipe Theatre, which performs in Romany, as described under
para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "6. North Rhine/Westphalia" [p. 142 above], the Land of North
Rhine/ Westphalia at the same time ensures that the bodies responsible for organizing
cultural activities make appropriate allowance for incorporating the knowledge of the
culture of this minority in the undertakings orga nized by these bodies.
7. Rhineland-Palatinate
In this regard, reference is made to para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "7. Rhineland-Palatinate", above.
8. Schleswig- Holstein
With the promotional funds provided by Schleswig-Holstein, the Land Association of
German Sinti and Roma ensures that appropriate allowance is made for incorporating the
knowledge and use of the Romany language and the culture of the German Sinti and Roma
in its own activities.
The Land Association of German Sinti and Roma also takes part in the Schleswig-HolsteinTag [a day dedicated to the special character of the Land], which is organized every two
years, in varying places of Schleswig-Holstein, and provides information on its work and on
the culture of this minority.
The Land Association is a partner in the project Kulturen, Sprachen, Minderheiten: Die dänische Grenzregion - Beispiel einer Konfliktlösung [Cultures, Languages, Minorities: The
Danish Border Region - An Example of Conflict Management] sponsored by SchleswigHolstein Land as part of the World Exhibition EXPO 2000 [in Hanover]. For this reason,
also staff of the Land Association took part in preparatory meetings.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Participation of Representatives of the Group Speaking the Given
Language in Cultural Activities –
(f)

to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities;

1. Baden-Wurttemberg
Reference is made to the comments on sub-para. (d) above.

160

2. Berlin
In Berlin, the responsible Senate Authorities have the two local associations of this language
group - the Berlin/Brandenburg Land Association of German Sinti and Roma and the
Romani Union Berlin/Brandenburg e.V. - participate as points of contact in the planning of
cultural activities.
In 1999, the Romani Union, together with Regionale Arbeitsstelle für Ausländerfragen [Regional Workshop for Matters relating to Foreigners] in Storkow, organized an international
Summer School for the Language and Culture of the Sinti and Roma. The Summer School
was sub sidized also by the Federal Ministry of the Interior and was organized under the
auspices of UNESCO.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Hamburg Senate Authority for Cultural Affairs is willing to encourage representatives
of this language group to participate in the work of cultural institutions and in planning
cultural activities. So far, however, pertinent requirements have only seldom been notified
by the language group.
4. Hesse
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (d) - "4. Hesse" [p.
143 above].
5. Lower Saxony
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "5. Lower
Saxony", above.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
Promotion of the Pralipe Theatre encourages representatives of this language group to
participate directly in the planning of cultural activities, and they actually make use of this
opportunity in practice.
7. Schleswig- Holstein
Every two years, this Land organizes Schleswig-Holstein-Tag [a day dedicated to the special
character of the Land] as a central cultural event. The organizations of the minority of
German Sinti and Roma are also invited to participate in this event and to take part in
arranging and organizing it.
Since 1995, the Land Association of German Sinti and Roma has been a member of the
festival's organizing body Landeskuratorium Schleswig-Holstein-Tag.

161

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Creation of Archive Bodies –
(g)

to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or
publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;

This obligation has been accepted by the Federal Republic of Germany.
Given the funding provided by the Bund [Federal Administration] and by the Land of
Baden-Wurttemberg to the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma,
this obligation is met nation-wide with regard to the Romany language since the tasks of this
Centre include collecting, keeping copies of, and publishing such works.

re: Art. 12, para. 2
(2)
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow,
encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in
accordance with the preceding paragraph.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, cultural activities keeping within the framework of the
law in force are not subject to any permit procedure or restrictions. Thus, the above
obligation is already fulfilled by the system of law in the Federal Republic of Germany. In
addition, several Länder have adopted this provision additionally in the sense of "undertake
... to allow"; such adoption does not entail any requirement for special implementation
measures. In this context it should be noted that the Sinti and Roma live dispersed in the
various Länder, with concentrations in the large cities (in this regard, reference is made to
the detailed comments in Part A, no. 3.4 [p. 7 above]), so that for this reason alone, it is not
possible for the Länder to confine their measures to a particular region of the resprective
Land.
This obligation has been accepted by the Länder of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse, North
Rhine/Westphalia and Schleswig- Holstein.

re: Art. 12, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing
their cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the
cultures they reflect.
Adoption of this obligation has been notified by the Federal Republic of Germany for the
entire federal territory since activities in the Romany language or related to the culture
reflected by Romany - e.g. guest performances by theatre companies or musical performances - can be organized in the context of Germany's cultural policy abroad. Examples are
the following activities:
- Häns'sche Weiss Ensemble (Sinti jazz), South East Asia tour in 1991, and HispanoAmerica North in 1994 (Goethe-Institut)

162

-

Möttes Band (Roman and Ricardo REINHARD; Sinti music and Yiddish songs), in New
York in 1998 (Goethe-Institut)
Pralipe (Roma Theatre), at the Festival of Central European Culture in London in
1998.

Article 13
Economic and Social Life
(1)
(a)

(c)
(d)

With regard to economic and social activi ties, the Parties undertake
within the whole country:
to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or
limiting without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority
languages in documents relating to economic or social life,
particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;
to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority
languages by means other than those specified in the above subparagraphs.

The obligations under sub-paragraphs (a), (c) and (d) have been accepted by the Federal
Republic of Germany. They are in compliance with the established law of the Federal
Republic of Germany and thus are already fulfilled nation-wide for all regional or minority
languages.
Implementation of the provision of sub-para. (d) is accomplished, for instance, by the
promotional funds provided by the Bund [Federal Administration] and by the Land of
Baden-Wurttemberg to the Bureau of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, which
is active in political and social life nation-wide, since the structures established for the selfmanage ment of the users of regional or minority languages increase the practical scope for
using the respective language outside the family. Similarly, the funding, by the Länder, of
the contact and counselling bureaus operated by Land Associations or clubs of German Sinti
and Roma - and given that such funding at the same time encourages and facilitates the use
of the Romany language - constitutes compliance with the aforementioned obligation.
Article 14
Transfrontier Exchanges
The Parties undertake:
(a)
to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind
them with the States in which the same language is used in identical
or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude such agreements,
in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of the same
language in the States concerned in the fields of culture, education,
information, vocational training and permanent education;

163

Acceptance of this provision has been notified by the Federal Republic of Germany for the
entire federal territory. The Framework Convention for the Protection of National
Minorities, upon its entry into force for the Republic of Austria, complies with this
provision of the Charter with regard to the Romany language. Co-operation between the
Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma and the Kulturverein Österreichischer Roma [Cultural Association of Austrian Roma], which is also State-subsidized,
has developed for a number of years already. Both sides keep up continuous exchanges of
information and share each other's publications. This co-operation also extends to the fields
of culture, education, vocational training and permanent education.

As of: 13 September 2000

Article 8
Education
(1)

With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory
in which such languages are used, according to the situation of
each of these languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of
the official language(s) of the State:

re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Pre-School Education –
(a)

(i)
to make available pre-school education in the relevant
regional or minority languages; or
(ii)
to make available a substantial part of pre-school education
in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
(iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii
above at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose
number is considered sufficient; or
(iv)
if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of pre-school education, to favour and/or encourage the
application of the measures referred to under i to iii above;

The Länder noted below have accepted the obligation under sub-paragraph (a) (iv).
1. Brandenburg
In Brandenburg Land, pre-school education is the responsibility of local authorities. Under
the Act on Financing Local Authorities, these latter receive funds for the purpose, inter alia,
of promoting institutions and measures in the field of pre-school educaton, e.g. daynurseries or children's day-care centres.
The Low German language is spoken in the northerly Landkreise of Uckermark, Prignitz,
Ostprignitz-Ruppin and Oberhavel. Not only does the Land Government not discourage the

164

use of the Low German language 5 in pre-school education, but it even takes a very positive
approach to this matter. However, no statistics are available on the extent to which Low
German is used.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In March 1999, the [Senate] Authority for Schools, Youth, and Vocational Training wrote to
all Hamburg schools and asked them, and schools in rural areas in particular, to accept
cultivation of the Low German language as an educational mandate. The extent to which
this request is complied with by the Hamburg pre-school establishments is not known since
these are not subject to any reporting requirements.
3. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Bremen has organized advisory services for children's day-care centres wishing to integrate
Low German into pre-school education.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Under its para. 1, the Concept for the Promotion of Low German in Schools,
Colleges/Universities and Linguistic and Cultural Work (Decision of the MecklenburgWestern Pomerania Landtag of 16 May 1991, Parliamentary Publication 1/93, pp. 1 - 4)
provides for measures designed for nursery schools or preparatory schools. It is
recommended to familiarize children of pre-school age with the Low German language. For
this purpose, four model projects might be carried out in co-operation with the universities
and the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and Training). The contact
persons for the children concerned should be either tutoresses proficient in the Low German
language or primary-school teachers.
In 1999, the actual status in the pre-school sector was as follows: In 56 children's day-care
centres of Volkssolidarität * Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Low German is occasionally
presented in the form of rhymes/verses, songs or play and games. The Schwerin, RostockStadt and Rügen Kreis Associations, have special interest groups (5 special groups with
about 58 - 68 children). The children study songs, verses, rhymes, dances and stories and
present these both as part of their own activity programmes and at events organized by
Volkssolidarität.
Also in children's day-care centres which are provided by the German Red Cross (DRK),
children rehearse a Low German programme for special occasions. The Siggelkow
children's day-care centre of the Parchim Kreis Administration has two groups dealing with
Low German. The children in these groups are familiarized with the Low German language
and take part in various regional activities. Also, the Geschwister Scholl Day-Care Centre of
the Güstrow Kreis Administration has two working groups with children attending nursery
school or day- nursery. Two years ago, a position under the Job Creation Scheme was
established at the Volkskulturinstitut [Institute of the Kulturbund for Folk Culture] in

Rostock, with the task of instructing pre-school and day-nursery children at Rostock
children's day-care centres in the Low German language.
Teaching of Low German is situation-based. The materials used for this instruction are the
"Niederdeutsches Liederbuch" ["Low German Songbook"] (pub l. by Hinstorff-Verlag
Rostock 1984) and "Mecklenburgische Spiele und Tänze för lütt Lüd" ["Mecklenburg Songs
and Dances for Little People"] (publ. by Volkskulturinstitut Rostock).
The institutions of Volkssolidarität Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as well as the German Red
Cross (DRK) have based their work on suggestions furnished by the Volkskulturinstitut
Mecklenburg und Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Institute of the Kulturbund for Folk
Culture, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania], the Landesheimatverband MecklenburgVorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional
Traditions, reg'd] and the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und
Ausbildung [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and Training].
For pre-school education, long-term provisions must be made for the training and further
education of tutoresses regarding the Low German language.
5. Lower Saxony
In the period 1997 - 2000, the Model Test "Bilingualism in Nursery Schools" was run at 36
nursery schools in Ostfriesland [Lower Saxony]. The success of this test is an
encouragement to continue the use of Low German in pre-school education. The Report on
the first year of the Model Test is available to interested readers. A final evaluation is
expected to be made in 2001. In its Further Training Programme for 2000, the Lower
Saxony Land Youth Welfare and Youth Service Office has, in co-operation with [the publiclaw corporation] Ostfriesische Landschaft, for the first time offered two Land-wide further
training activities on the sub ject of bilingualism (standard German/Low German) in
children's day-care centres.
6. Saxony-Anhalt
Pursuant to the Decision of 19-11-1991 adopted by the Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt
(Parliamentary Publication 1/24/908 B), the Land Government is obliged to promote, in
particular, the Low German language, together with its cultural traditions. The Directives on
the Allocation of Grants, inter alia for the cultivation and preservation of local/regional
customs, explicitly lay down that promotion of Low German - in the form of musical,
literary or language-related activities in the pre-school and extracurricular sectors, for
instance in clubs, workshops and self-organized groups - is eligible for allocation of funds.
On the basis of these Directives, natural persons and associations can receive Land- funding
to a maximum amount of 70 per cent of the expenses eligible for allocation of funds.
For a major part, cultivation of the Low German language in Saxony-Anhalt is pursued by
dedicated individuals, clubs, societies or interest groups, among whose stated aims are the
cultivation, fostering and preservation of Low German as part of the general local/regional
milieu. The activities range from everyday use of the language to Lo w German workshops
and dialect meetings in which major numbers of children and youngsters from the various
regions take part.

166

The extent to which the many and various offers are made use of by pre-school
establishments run by local authorities is not known since these establishments are not
subject to any obligations of reporting.
7. Schleswig- Holstein
In pre-school education, children are to be tutored, assisted and educated according to their
developmental level and on the basis of a holistic approach. The professional staff and the
other staff members in children's day-care centres and other day care establishments
support, complement and expand family-based education. They orient themselves by the
needs of the children and families and co-operate with parents/guardians. The aim of the
work in children's day-care centres is, inter alia, to foster the living together of children
from different national and cultural backgrounds.
The regional language Low German is spoken throughout the Land of Schleswig- Holstein.
Many children's day-care centres have tutors/tutoresses proficient in this language for
passing on Low German to the children.
Since 1998, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutsches Schleswig (ADS - Working Group "German
Schleswig Region") has offered Low German as part of a Language Encounter Project at
seven of its nursery schools.

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Bremen at present reviews the pertinent curricula for compatibility with the accepted
obligation. Where any deficits are identified, the necessary adjustments will be made.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
All Hamburg curricula for the subject 'German' provide that Low German should
occasionally be included in teaching, for instance in connection with grammatical
phenomena or in literature classes. The extent to which such suggestions are taken up in
class largely depends on the interest taken by the teacher in the subject and on his/her
proficiency in the Low German language.
At two- year intervals, the Low German reading competition "Jungs un Deerns leest Platt"
["Boys and Girls reading Low German"], which is supported by Hamburger Sparkasse
[Hamburg Savings Bank] and is very popular among its 'established clientele' at some 50
schools, is organized for grades 3 to 10 and for the upper secondary grades (of grammar
schools). The final event of the competition, which meets with much attention by the media,
is held as a matinée at the Ohnsorg-Theater. In the years between, the reading competition
"Schoolkinner lest Platt" ["School Children reading Low German"] is organized for the
same age groups in the Bezirk of Harburg/Wilhelmsburg/Süderelbe. The organizing body is
the Vereen Plattdüütsch leevt e.V. [Registered Association "Low German is Alive"], and the
sponsor is Hamburger Bank. This competition, too, is attended by many participants from

167

the regional schools of all types. Both competitions are promoted by the [Senate] Authority
for Schools, Youth, and Vocational Training with publications, publicity, jury work and by
payment of fees to the co-ordinators.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
In Section 2, para. 3, of the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Schools Act of 15 May
1996, cultivation of the Low German language has been laid down as an essential
component part of the educational mandate; the provision reads as follows: "The attachment
of pupils to their natural, social and cultural environment, and the cultivation of the Low
German language shall be promoted".
The "Konzeption zur Förderung des Niederdeutschen in der Schule, an den Hochschulen
und in der Sprach- und Kulturarbeit" ["Concept for the Promotion of Low German in
School, Colleges/ Universities and in Linguistic and Cultural Work"] (Decision of 16 May
1991, adopted by Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Landtag, Parliamentary Publication
1/93) already provided, in its para. 2, that "Low German shall be offered on a facultative
basis in general-education schools and vocational schools". This refers, in particular, to the
relevant elements of the subjects 'German', 'local history and geography, and elementary
science', 'music', and 'arts and design'. Access to Low German is also provided in the
context of compulsory subjects of choice [required elective subjects] and in a wide range of
out-of-school activities.
Low German is not explicitly included in the Ordinance of 3 June 1996 on Approved
Subject Hours in Primary Education; but Low German can be integrated into German and
elementary science lessons. Under para. 3.12, the draft Decree on Primary Education
provides the following: "On the basis of the framework curricula, Low German shall be
included in classroom instruction - primarily in German, elementary science, and music - as
well as in out-of-school activities".
The findings and conclusions of an evaluation conference are reflected in a revised version
of the Framewo rk Curriculum 'Low German 1999'. In 1999, a Framework Curriculum for
Low German (applying to all types of schools and to the various grades/age-groups) entered
into force for general-education schools, i.e. including primary schools.
Guidance material regarding the Low German Framework Curriculum was published
already in May 1996. In contains instructions on how to apply the Framework Curriculum,
i.e. general and subject-related literature recommendations, addresses of contact persons for
Low German, and extracts from policy publications on the assessment and cultivation of the
Low German language in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
In November 1997, the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und
Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and
Training) conducted a survey covering, inter alia, the situation of Low German in primary
schools. 125 primary schools took part in that survey. The number of primary schools where
Low German is used in the context of festivities and ceremonies is, with 92.4 %, at a very
high level. The findings of the survey show that pupils and teachers take a keen interest in
dealing with Low German in primary school. At the 125 primary schools participating in the
survey, Low German was included, with a share of 94 %, in regular class instruction (e.g.
German, music, performing play, elementary science, geography) and, with a share of 23 %,

168

was used, for instance, in the context of activity groups, theatre programmes or the Low
German competition.
The Low German reading and recital competition "Wi snacken platt" ["We're talking in Low
German"] - which is granted financial support by the Ministry for Education, Science,
Research and Cultural Affairs and by the savings banks of the Land of MecklenburgWestern Pomerania - has proved an excellent means for promoting the Low German
language ("Niederdeutsch" or "Plattdeutsch"). The Land-wide Low German competition is
supported and organized jointly by the Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions], the
Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Institute of the
Kulturbund for Folk Culture, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania] and the Landesinstitut
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Land Institute for Schools
and Training). At the primary schools and all general-education secondary schools, pupils
participate in the Low German competition. Some 2,000 children and youngsters are
reached every year by the Low German competition, for which special educational materials
are available.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
According to the education targets (Section 4 of the Schleswig-Holstein Schools Act),
schools shall, inter alia, foster an open attitude among young people towards cultural diversity.
Already in 1992, the Ministry of Education once more stressed the importance of Low
German for the education of pupils in Schleswig- Holstein and adopted policy guidance to be
followed by the schools of this Land. The "Low German in School" Decree of 07-01-1992
provides the framework for the promotion of the Low German language and for the
mandatory inclusion of the culture of Northern Germany, which owes its special character to
Low German. The curricula comprise modules for Low German.
A mandatory task of schools is to impart knowledge of the Low German literature and
language in subjects suited for the purpose and to include those spheres of life, which are
determined and influenced by Low German, in classroom instruction. In addition, schools
shall foster the ability to speak Low German and encourage use of the Low German
language.
For primary schools, Low German is included in the curriculum. Thus, the keynote theme
"Früher und Heute erforschen" ["Exploring the Past and the Present Time"] comprises the
subject "Das Niederdeutsche als die Weltsprache des Nordens" ["Low German as the World
Language of the North"] (during the period of the Hanseatic League) and "Landessprache
heute kennen lernen" ["Getting to know today's ve rnacular"].
Schools carry out a reading competition "Schüler/innen lesen Platt" ["Pupils reading Low
German"]. On the occasion of the 1998 competition, the Schleswig- Holstein Sparkassenund Giroverband [savings banks and their clearing association] distributed 75,000 readers to
elementary and secondary modern schools, Realschulen [secondary technical schools] and
Gymnasien [grammar schools] and comprehensive schools.
(b)

(iv)
to apply one of the measures provided for under i to iii above
at least to those pupils whose families so request and whose number
is considered sufficient;

169

1. Brandenburg
Low German is not offered as a regular subject of classroom instruction in Brandenburg.
However, such instruction is not the only means for school-based promotion of the Low
German language and culture; at the Brandenburg schools it is also possible to institute
activity groups where interested pupils can study the Low German language and culture.
Activity groups of this type have been established at three schools in the northern region of
the Land. On demand, additional activity groups can also be established at other schools.
Also, 'local history and geography' lessons can familiarize pupils with the special cultural
features of their home region. In the northern Landkreise of Brandenburg, which have
received decisive stimuli from the Low German language and culture, instruction of this
type is ensured.
2. Saxony-Anhalt
The Framework Curricula for the subject 'German' recommend use of Low German
literature and/or of texts characterized by vernacular forms of expression, with due regard to
the particular local fe atures and forms of the German language (especially Low German),
and phased instruction in the vernacular. However, teachers are not under an obligation to
follow these recommendations since conditions and circumstances vary from one region to
another. As a general rule, such teaching is to be based on the pupils' current proficiency in
the language and on the situation within the respective learning group.
All schools in the Low German speech area of Saxony-Anhalt have, as a suggestion for
classroom instruction and out-of-school activities, received the brochure "Niederdeutsche
Texte aus Sachsen-Anhalt" ["Low German Texts from Saxony-Anhalt"] which in 1992 was
developed by the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch [Workshop for Low German] of what then
was the Teacher Training College (now Otto von Guericke University) in Magdeburg. Also,
the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch at the Institute for German/Germanic Philology of Otto von
Guericke University in Magdeburg in 1992 and 1997 published brochures entitled "Niederdeutsch im Unterricht - Arbeitshilfe für den schulischen Umgang mit dem Niederdeutschen
in Sachsen-Anhalt" [Low German in classroom instruction in Saxony-Anhalt]. The 1997
brochure includes a CD, with Low German text samples, which was produced by the
Landesinstitut für Lehrerfortbildung Sachsen-Anhalt (LISA - Land Institute for Follow-up
Training of Teachers).
In addition, the activities to be encouraged in schools can, on the one hand, be carried out
within the framework of activity groups and optional-subject courses and, on the other, take
the form of out-of-school activities. The latter are supported, for example, by the following
promotional programmes:
- Programme "Gesundes Leben, gesunde Umwelt, Schule als kultureller Lernort" ["A
healthy life; a healthy environment; schools as a place of cultural learning"];
- Directive on the Promotion of Youth-Related and Educational Projects for Guidance on
Lifestyle Choices;
- school-based leisure-time education as a contribution, at publicly maintained schools
and by private providing bodies, to social prevention.
In addition, the schools in Saxony-Anhalt are urged to co-operate with non-school providing
bodies/organizers, especially in the case of out-of-school activities.

170

The traditional Low German reading competition, which since 1995 has been organized
annually - under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs - by the
Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V. [Saxony-Anhalt Land Union for Local and
Regional Traditions] and the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch of Otto von Guericke University in
Magdeburg Land-wide at all elementary and secondary schools and Gymnasien [grammar
schools] in the Low German speech area of the Land of Saxony-Anhalt, has in the meantime
become an important factor in promoting the Low German language. The past few years
have seen a marked increase in the numbers of pupils participating in the competition: while
in 1997 and 1998, 40 schools in Saxony-Anhalt took part in the Low German reading
competition, their number rose to 45 already in 1999. The majority of these schools already
had established activity groups for the cultivation and fostering of Low German; in some
cases, the institution of such activity groups was prompted by this competition so that the
latter has in the meantime become an important factor in promoting the Low German
language in Saxony-Anhalt. Every two years, a brochure containing suitable texts is
developed for this competition and, through the Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs,
is distributed to all schools in the Low German region of the Land. These brochures can also
be used in German lessons since they contain age-appropriate texts.
Another - out-of-school - form of promoting the proficiency of interested and particularly
talented children in the Low German language was the first Mundartcamp [Dialect Camp] open for participation nation-wide - organized by the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt
e.V. [Saxony-Anhalt Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions] in Schierke in SachsenAnhalt from 30 July - 8 August 1999. In view of its success, another Mundartcamp will,
with Land funding, take place also in 2000.

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Bremen at present reviews the pertinent curricula for compatibility with the accepted

2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hambur g
In a Circular addressed to all Hamburg schools, attention was drawn to the possibility to
offer Low German, on a facultative basis, in the lower secondary grades [secondary
education stage I], depending on the type of school, as part of a two- year or even four-year
course, as a required elective subject. For this purpose, the [Senate] Authority for Schools,
Youth, and Vocational Training published guidance material entitled "Plattdüütsch för Lüüd

171

in Hamburg un ümto" ["Low German for People in Hamburg and its Environs"] which
provides the didactic bases and examples for learning the Low German language, as well as
many Low German texts, sketches and songs for classroom use. So far, little information is
available on the extent to which use has been made of these facilities, since schools are not
subject to any obligations of reporting.
Upon request, a two-semester elementary course 'Low German' can be offered in the second
stage of secondary education [i.e. upper secondary grades]. For this purpose, the Authority
for Schools, in co-operation with schools and Hamburg University, has developed an educational concept.
In all other respects, cf. the comments under sub-para. (b) (iii) above - "2. Hamburg".

172

3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
On the basis of the 1991 "Konzeption zur Förderung des Niederdeutschen in der Schule, an
den Hochschulen und in der Sprach- und Kulturarbeit" ["Concept for the Promotion of Low
German in School, Colleges/Universities and in Linguistic and Cultural Work"] and of the
Meckle nburg-Western Pomerania Land Schools Act of 15 May 1996, a Framework
Curriculum for Low German as an Optional Compulsory Subject [Required Elective] was
developed in 1995 by a Commis sion.
Already in 1995, a Commission developed a Low German Framework Curriculum for
secondary modern schools, Realschulen [secondary technical schools], Gymnasien
[grammar schools] and comprehe nsive schools.
The Low German Framework Curriculum applies to instruction in a required elective
subject and is geared to modern trends in the design of curricula and in classroom
instruction. On the one hand, the Framework Curriculum applies to all types of schools and
year-groups so that the same objectives and contents form the basis of required elective
courses in Low German in all schools of the Land. On the other hand, the Low German
Framework Curriculum - with its rational form focusing on priority tasks, objectives,
educational fields and subjects - gives the individual teacher a wide scope for his/her own
ideas and/or for joint decisions with the pupils.
The topics listed in the Framework Curriculum give suggestions also for the inclusion of
Low German in other subjects, mainly German, and arts and design, but also history,
geography, social studies and performing play, and for instruction in facultative subjects and
leisure-time activities. The 1995 Framework Curriculum has been tested and proved
effective.
The Framework Curriculum applies to secondary modern schools, Realschulen [secondary
technical schools], Gymnasien [grammar schools] and comprehensive schools. After a test
phase, the Low German Framework Curriculum was, in 1999, declared mandatory for
primary schools and all general-education secondary schools (of all types and for the
various grades/age groups).
In November 1997, the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and Training)
carried out a survey of the situation regarding coverage of the Low German language in the
general-education schools of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The following generaleducation schools responded to this questionnaire-based survey:

For 22.4 % of the respondents, Low German is of no significance; in the view of 16.4 %,
Low German is very important and/or significant in terms of tradition; and 45.2 % state that
Low German is used in the context of school festivities and ceremonies.
The respective quality of Low German instruction is shown by the breakdown of the various
forms of Low German instruction/activities:

music, performing play, elementary

4 = other (e.g. activity groups, performances
within the framework of programmes, Low
German competition, amateur theatricals)
The base of the percentages given in the above breakdown is not 100 for all figures, since
multiple replies were included.
The figures for language proficiency of the teachers in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are
10.2 teachers/school for understanding Low German, and 3.1 teachers/school for speaking
the Low German language. Notwithstanding the relatively high ratio of teachers proficient
in the language, the number of those prepared to teach Low German is small. For the
Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung, this entails the
particular task of further training linguistically competent teachers in such a way that they
will be able to integrate Low German in their classes.
According to the assessment made, by the majority of respondents, of the problems involved
in the cultivation of Low German in the schools of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the
scope for speaking and learning the Low German language has been curtailed over the past
two or three years. One of the reasons give n is that, for the major part, the Approved Subject
Hours [i.e. allocation of teaching periods among subjects in each school year as prescribed
by the Ministry] do not explicitly include the Low German language. Also, the
discontinuation of courses substituting religious instruction in secondary schools has
resulted in eliminating what has been described as an essential means for cultivating the
Low German language. Another reason given for the decrease in activities for the

174

cultivation of Low German is the retirement of many teachers of pensionable age or earlyretirement age. Also, pupils show a deplorable lack of interest in this matter.
For the reinforcement of Low German activities in secondary education, the following longterm measures should be taken:
1. establishing a network of multipliers for Low German;
2. provision of a class-hour pool for Low German;
3. designation of school commissioners for Low German.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
Already in 1992, the Ministry of Education once more stressed the importance of Low German for the education of pupils in Schleswig- Holstein and adopted policy guidelines to be
followed by the schools of this Land. The "Low German in School" Decree of 07-01-1992
provides the framework for the promotion of the Low German language and for the mandatory inclusion of the culture of Northern Germany, which ows its special character to Low
German.
The curricula which entered into force as of 01-08-1997 establish Low German as a task
area of general educational significance; various subject-specific curricula (German, history,
political science, etc.) explicitly include the Low German language.
The Institut für Praxis und Theorie der Schule [Institute for Practical and Theoretical School
Matters] and the Centres for Low German in Leck and Ratzeburg assist schools by
providing, inter alia, guidance material for designing/organizing classroom instruction, and
readers for use in class. In addition, a network of Land, Regional and Kreis Commissioners
has been established.

In this respect, reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iv).
As regards the future detailed implementation of the obligations in the field of education, it
should be noted that since 1999, a scientific survey has been conducted by the Arbeitsstelle
Niederdeutsch of Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg on the use of, proficiency in,
and assessment of, the Low German language by pupils. Interim findings are expected to be
available in the second half of the year 2000.

1. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
German language/literature instruction at vocational/technical schools, which now is mostly
called 'Language and Communication', largely focuses on working- life processes. In this
respect, there is little room for interfacing with Low German. However, wherever feasible,
the Low German language is taken into account.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
The 1991 Konzeption zur Förderung des Niederdeutschen in der Schule, an den
Hochschulen und in der Sprach- und Kulturarbeit [Concept for the Promotion of Low
German in School, Colleges/Universities and in Linguistic and Cultural Work], in its para. 2
- "school instruction", explicitly includes vocational/technical schools with regard to Low
German instruction.
The 1999 Low German Framework Curriculum for primary schools and all generaleducation secondary schools (of all school types and for the various grades/age groups)
contains many suggestions for integrating the Low German language into other subjects
taught in class - primarily German, arts and design, but also history, geography and social
science.
These conceptual approaches can also be applied to the vocational training sector.

Bremen University regularly offers Low German language and literature courses. The University is planning additional courses, especially as regards the teacher course of study
regarding the subject 'German'. In addition, the University is planning to increase its Low
German activities through co-operation with other colleges/universities in the Low German
speech area (inter alia, Oldenburg University in Lower Saxony).
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Hamburg University offers seminars in the Low German language and literature. Low
German can be chosen as a minor for the examination for the Master's Diploma. This choice
does not, however, exist under the teacher examination regulations.

176

3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, colleges/universities offer a large variety of Low German courses.
3.1 In the 1992/93 winter semester, a chair for Low German Philology was re-instituted at
Rostock University. At present, however, provision of materials for this professorate is
at a very low level. Low German is part of the German/Germanic philology course of
study (teaching profession and Master's degree). Courses in Low German can be
recognized as credits for that course of study. For all trainee teachers majoring in
German, participation in the course "Überblick über die Niederdeutsche Sprache und
Literatur" ["Survey of the Low German Language and Literature"] (2 hours a week per
semester) is mandatory.
For students following a course of study for the teaching profession at Gymnasien
[grammar schools], secondary modern schools and Realschulen [secondary technical
schools], a required ele ctive subject, of the main course of studies, is language history
includ ing, in particular, the historical language stages 'Old Saxon' and 'Middle Low
German'. An important element of the subject-specific didactics for 'German' is
"Niederdeutsch und Schule" ["Low German and the School"].
M.A. students, too, can select Low German as a main subject (for a main course of
studies, at least 8 hours a week per semester).
For all courses of study (teaching profession/Master's degree) students can also take, as
equivalent subjects, courses in Early German Literature, Modern German Literature,
Language History, and Present-Day Speech. Like the courses "Learning Low German",
these courses (especially lectures and seminars) are offered as part of courses in
general education.
The practice-oriented approach to the teaching of the Low German language is manifested, inter alia, by the fact that it has been possible to recruit members of the Niederdeutsche Bühne Rostock [Low German Theatre in Rostock] as lecturers.
The integration of the Wossidlo-Forschungsstelle [Wossidlo Research Institute] has
been a particular acquisition to the Faculty of Humanities. Richard Wossidlo (1859 1939) is considered the founder of the study of the Mecklenburg culture and customs.
His collection of traditional linguistic knowledge regarding the vernacular is uniquely
complete and authentic in the German speech area. This collection also provided the
basic stock of the "Mecklenburgisches Wörterbuch" ["Mecklenburg Dictionary"]
which is not just a language dictionary but also a reference work on folklore [study of
the material culture and customs]. The task of the "Institut für Volkskunde (WossidloArchiv)" ["Institute for the Study of the Material Culture and Customs (Wossidlo
Archives)"] is to study the folk culture of Mecklenburg and of Western Pomerania,
which is the subject of comparative studies in the sense of European Ethnology
(focusing on Northern and Eastern Europe).
Research is focused on: research on narrative art, maritime folklore, research on
customs and traditions, and child-specific culture. Teaching covers the entire canon
(including folk art, handicrafts, construction and housing, clothing and food). To the

177

extent possible, references to present-day affairs and ideas are included in the study of
cultural history.
While for research on narrative art (Mecklenburg and Pomeranian fairy and folk tales,
legends, droll stories/anecdotes, fables, proverbs, etc.) and for song research the Low
German language forms the medium, folklore subjects and the respective vernacular
names and words are interwoven in the remainder of the canon. Thus, the study of
regional folklore at the same time serves to illustrate the dialectal linguistic heritage.
Until the introduction of a major or minor in folklore study, pertinent credits can only
be obtained for courses offered by the Institut für Germanistik, the Institut für Geschichte [Institute for History] and the Institut für Schulpädagogik [Intitute for School
Pedagogy].
Students show a keen interest in Low German courses and lectures.
3.2 With the establishment, in 1992, of a professorship for Low German at Ernst Moritz
Arndt University in Greifswald, the Institut für Deutsche Philologie for the first time
acquired a Low German Section. A research assistant and a part-time secretarial help
have been assigned to the Low German professorate. This resulted in the development
of an independent Low German course of study at the Greifswald University. In
addition, this Section has the task of participating in the education offered by the
following departments: Early German Language and Literature, German Language,
Modern and Contemporary German Literature, German as a Foreign Language.
Low German instruction has intentionally been structured in such a way that Landspecific priorities are set across the whole spectrum ranging from exercises for learning
the Low German of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the assignment of topics for
State Examination and M.A. dissertations and for doctoral theses. In this way, the
students of the Greifswald University are to be specifically prepared for their later employment, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, as teachers or in cultural cultural institutions or the media.
Examples of Land-specific priority subjects are courses on
Low German idioms and the standard German colloquial language in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania;
Low German in schools and churches of Pomerania from the [Protestant]
Reformation until our times;
the use and ranking of Low German in Mecklenburg and Pomerania from the 16th
until the 20th Century;
Fritz Reuter, John Brinckman and other Low German poets and writers of this
Land;
superstitions, historical customs, and folk tales in Mecklenburg and Pomerania.
The Low German faculty section offers three courses of study, including university
places for students and examination regulations:
-

"Low German as a subsidiary subject" as part of the general course of study in
German/Germanic philology, for students graduating as teachers for Realschulen
[secondary technical schools] and Gymnasien [grammar schools];

178

-

"Study of the Low German language and literature, as a minor subject" as part of
the M.A. course of study;
"Low German as an additional course of studies" for students of subjects other
than German/Germanic philology, for graduates and grammar school teachers in
training.

The various courses of study include courses and lectures on folklore [material culture
and customs] which are also carried out by this faculty section. Low German may be
chosen as one of the subjects of the State Examination, the examination for a Master's
diploma or for taking a doctor's degree.
Also, Ernst Moritz Arndt University in Greifswald will, as of the 2000/2001 winter
semester, institute a new Low German course of study leading to a B.A. degree
(Bachelor of Arts). This 6-semester course of study is to impart regional cultural
competence, comprising basic knowledge of the Low German language as well as the
ability to reflect on regional cultural processes. The novelty presented by the
Greifswald model is the structuring, both in terms of form and contents, of this course
of study. Placing greater emphasis on the students' future professional practice, the
model aims at basic knowledge without specialization. The specific subjects of study
are complemented by general studies: language instruction in German and English, and
courses in the fields of economics and law, study of civilization, and pædago gics. Both
the subject-specific course of study and the general studies are organized in modules
comprising courses and lectures on interrelated topics. An internship is to complement
the B.A. studies.
In addition, at the initiative of the Faculty of Humanities, a concept entitled "Nord- und
osteuropäische Kulturen - Interdisziplinäre Ostseeraumstudien" ["Cultures of Northern
and Eastern Europe - Interdisciplinary Studies on the Baltic Region"] is being
developed which, inter alia, integrates Low German into the field of Baltic Region
research.
The "Pommersches Wörterbuch" ["Pomerian Dictionary"] is collated at the Greifswald
Ernst Moritz Arndt University.
4. Lower Saxony
Two major universities in Lower Saxony offer courses on Low German. The Low German
Language and Literature Department of the Deutsches Seminar [Institute for German] of
Göttingen University is responsible for the independent course of study 'Low German
Language and Literature' where the Low German language and literature are studied in the
component subject areas of linguistics, literature, and medievalist studies. Main study fields
are, inter alia, historical and contemporary dialectology of Low German, and sociolinguistic
research on Low German. The professor holding this chair is one of the initiators, and a
collaborator, of the "Grammatik des Niederdeutschen" ["Low German Grammar"] and
editor of the "Niedersächsisches Wörterbuch" ["Lower Saxon Dictionary"] which on a
continuing basis is developed further by the Göttingen University Arbeitsstelle directed by
this professor.
As the Chairman of the Ostfälisches Institut [Eastphalia Institute], the professor holding the
chair dedicates his efforts to the cultivation of Low German as used in Ostfalen.

179

The Institute is designed as an academic/scholarly centre and fulfils the following tasks:
a) collection, classification and scientific analysis of works in the Low German language,
with particular regard to the present time;
b) editing the work results for the general public;
c) co-ordination of, and support for, all efforts aimed at cultivating and preserving the
Low German language;
d) maintenance and development of links with similar institutions, also abroad.
In this way, the institution promotes scientific purposes. Thus, it is of service, at the same
time, to education in general and to popular education, and to international understanding. It
exclusively and directly pursues nonprofit/public-benefit and scientific purposes.
5. Schleswig- Holstein
As part of the course of studies for the teaching profession, a requirement stipulated by the
Universities in Kiel and Flensburg for admission to examinations in the subject 'German' is
proof of attendance of a course in Low German or Frisian. In addition, Low German may be
selected as a supplementary subject for all courses of study for the teaching profession.
The Germanistisches Seminar [Institute for German/Germanic Philology] of Kiel University
has its own Low German Language and Literature Department. For the major part, the
credits obtained for courses/lectures of this Department can be taken over for the course of
study in German/Germanic philology. Within the latter course of study, a main subject can
be chosen from the Low German study field. The same can be done in the 'German' course
of study for grammar school teachers. In addition, Low German exercises in subject-specific
didactics are offered also to students graduating as teachers for other subjects.
Within the framework of university education, the Low German Language and Literature
Department offers a wide range of courses and lectures also for students enrolled in other
faculties. Thus, for instance, one course per semester is held specifically for students of
theology, on the subjects of Low German preaching and parochial work. The annual
"Internationaler Wissenschaftlicher Ferienkurs der Universität Kiel" ["International
Academic Holiday Course of Kiel University"] entitled "Deutschland heute - Sprache,
Gesellschaft, Staat, Kultur" ["Present-Day Germany - Language, Society, State, Culture"]
offers a series of courses and lectures on Low German, which are attended by the foreign
participants.
(e)

(iii) if, by reason of the role of the State in relation to higher
education institutions, sub-paragraphs i and ii cannot be applied, to
encourage and/or allow the provision of university or other forms of
higher education in regional or minority languages or of facilities
for the study of these languages as university or higher education
subjects;

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of North Rhine/Westphalia.
In North Rhine/Westphalia, universities or colleges can offer instruction in Low German or
a course of study in the Low German language.
Within the framework of their mandates, the Low German Language and Literature
Department of Münster University and the Faculty of Linguistics and Literature of Bielefeld

180

University, in partic ular, dedicate their efforts to the cultivation of the Low German
language and literature. Thus, for instance, Münster University during the 1996/97 [winter]
semester held seminars on the subjects of "Von Emden bis Maastricht: Sprache im deutschniederländischen Grenzraum" ["From Emden zu Maastricht: Language in the
German/Dutch border area"] and "Münsterländer Plattdeutsch" ["Münsterland Low
German"], and during the 1998/99 semester offered lectures on "Niederdeutsch in der
Schule" ["Low German in school"]; during the 1999/ 2000 semester it held seminars on
"ältere Sprachstufen des Deutschen (Niederdeutsch)" ["early linguistic stages of German
(Low German)"] and on the "Dialektologie des Niederdeutschen" ["Study of Low German
Dialects and Dialectal Variations"]. Research priorities of the Low German Language and
Literature Department of Münster University during the period 1997/1998 included, for
instance, "Niederdeutsch-hochdeutscher Sprachwechsel" ["Low German/High German
language transition"], "Niederdeutsche Toponomastik" ["Low German Toponomastics* "],
"Studien zur mittelniederdeutschen Literatur" ["Studies on Middle Low German
Literature"], and "Studien zum Werk von Augustin Wibbelt" ["Studies on Augustin Wibbelt's
Work"]. Over the past few years, the Research Group 'Study of Literature' of Bielefeld
University has dealt with the following research subjects: 'Low German and National
Socialism [Nazism]', 'Low German cultural scene'/'Low German literature', Re ference
Grammar of Low German Usage, and the Low German spoken by repatriates. At Bielefeld
University, research is carried out on the subject: "Sprachinselforschung: Niederdeutsch in
den USA" ["Speech Island Research: Low German in the U.S."]. Also, during the 1999/2000
semester, Bielefeld University offered a lecture on "Niederdeutsche Autorinnen des 20.
Jahrhunderts" ["20th Century Female Authors writing in Low German"]. During the 2000
summer semester, Ruhr-Universität in Bochum holds a seminar on "Aktuelle Forschungen
zum Niederdeutschen" ["Topical Research on Low German"].

(iii) if the public authorities have no direct competence in the
field of adult education, to favour and/or encourage the offering of
such languages as subjects of adult and continuing education;

1. Brandenburg
Section 4, paras. 1 and 2, of the Act to regulate and promote Continuing Education in
Brandenburg Land (abbrev. BbgWBG, or WBG) of 15 December 1993 embodies the Land's
obligation to promote continuing education and to support the recognized providing bodies
of continuing education. Under Section 27 of the WBG, the Land shall fund a share of the
personnel expenses and of the cost of materials. In addition, courses can be subsidized by
residential educational institutions and model projects focusing on topical subjects. Care
must be taken to ensure diversity of providing bodies.
The Brandenburg part of the Low German speech area has four Kreisvolkshochschulen, i.e.
the Kreis Adult Education Centres of Uckermark, Prignitz, Ostprignitz- Ruppin and
Oberhavel. Detailed programming is the responsibility of the respective Kreis Adult
Education Centres themselves. Generally the willingness to include the Low German
language and the Low German cultural heritage does exist. In instances, however, language
courses were not held on account of insufficient demand. Nevertheless, attempts will be
made also in future, for instance in the Uckermark region, to offer such courses. There also
have been occasional activities in the framework of co-operation projects, for instance
readings by Low German writers.
2. Lower Saxony
In Ostfriesland, Low German is offered by various adult education centres, both for
language learning and as proficiency consolidation and conversation courses.
3. Schleswig- Holstein
In Schleswig-Holstein, there are many possibilities of following continuing education for
people wishing to learn and study Low German. In 1999, more than forty adult education
centres in Schleswig-Holstein offered courses for the learning and practising of the Low
German language.
The Zentrum für Niederdeutsch [Centre for Low German] in Ratzeburg pursues specific
public information/education activities in this field.
Courses and seminars are also offered - in part with funding provided by the Land - by
associations committed to the promotion of the Low German language, especially by the
Schleswig-Holsteinischer Heimatbund [Schleswig-Holstein Union for Local and Regional
Traditions].

re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Teaching of the History and Culture Education –
(g)

to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

182

Given the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, the implementation of this
obligation is primarily the responsibility of the Länder. In the field of education in the
Länder, promoting the knowledge of the culture, history, languages and religion of the
respective minorities/language groups as well as of the majority population is part of the
curricula of publicly maintained and private schools. An important role in imparting
knowledge of the culture of the language groups, in and outside schools, is played by the
state institutions for political education - i.e. the Federal Centre and the Land Centres for
Political Education.
The Federal Centre for Political Education (BpB) has the task, through political education
activities, to promote, among the German people, the understanding of political facts and
processes, to strengthen democratic consciousness, and to encourage greater readiness for
political involvement. It also has the particular task of providing scientifically sound and
substantiated information on political key issues, strengthening the democratic basic consensus and, on these foundations, promoting the development of a culture of (democratic)
political dispute on the basis of a rational dialogue. This also includes information on the
living together of the various cultures represented in Germany, and on the reduction of
prejudice and xenophobia (e.g. the monographs on "Argumente gegen den Hass - Über
Vorurteile, Fremdenfeindlichkeit und Rechtsextremismus" ["Arguments against hatred About prejudices, xenophobia and right-wing extremism"], 3rd reprint 1997, and the
"Lexikon der ethnischen Minderheiten in Deutschland" ["Encyclopædia of the Ethnic
Minorities in Germany"]. A broad-based study, which was presented at the end of 1997,
confirmed that the materials prepared by the Federal Centre for Political Education are
used, with extraordinary frequency, in classroom instruction and for the preparation of
lessons. The high degree of acceptance of these publications and materials was attributed
primarily to their politically well-balanced presentation.
During the "European Year against Racism [and Xenophobia]" (1997), the Federal Centre
for Political Education, under the motto of "Dialogue of Cultures", organized a Congress
which was attended by more than 3,000 participants. At the suggestion of the Federal
President, a concept was developed for related events/meetings, centred around the work of
many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) which come out against racism and stand up
for tolerance, international understanding and humanitarianism. At some 80 meetings/events
held centrally and decentrally, the participants analysed and discussed various subjects and
the actual implementation of the intercultural dialogue.
All of the Länder of the Federal Republic of Germany have established Land Centres for
Political Education which fulfil similar tasks with special reference to the respective Land.
The materials developed by these institutions on issues relating to the co-existence of the
various cultures represented in Germany are used as teaching materials both in schools and
in adult education.
The Federal Government and the Länder endeavour to further improve the available
educational and informational offers regarding the language groups concerned outside their
settlement areas. The language groups regard the education/information activities which so
far have been carried out outside the central settlement areas as insufficient and, in
particular, miss a nation-wide survey concerning the five language groups.
The undertakings entered into by the Länder ensure that also non-speakers of Low German
have access to this language.

183

1. Brandenburg
In Section 4, para. 5, sub-para. 11, of the Brandenburg Schools Act of 12 April 1996, the
Land has embodied the obligation of schools to ensure that, in imparting knowledge, skills
and value concepts, the readiness and ability of pupils to understand their own culture as
well as other cultures, also within their own country, will be particularly promoted. This
includes imparting of the Low German culture which, as an autochthonous culture of Northern Germany, plays an important role in this respect. The additional obligation to impart
these cultural foundations also to those pupils whose culture is not the Low German culture
ensures that, at least in the Low German speech area and cultural area, also those pupils
whose family roots are not in the Low German area will be instructed in the fundamentals of
the Low German culture.
The educational objectives shall not be pursued in one subject only, but shall be included in
all appropriate subjects. Thus, it must be ensured that both the historic aspects of the Low
German culture and the diversity of present-day forms of cultural expression will be
reflected in literature, music, visual arts, etc.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Bremen at present reviews the pertinent curricula for compatibility with the accepted
obligation. Where any deficits are identified, the necessary adjustments will be made.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In Hamburg, the Low German language was flourishing at the time of the Hanseatic League
and determined daily life. History lessons in school draw attention to this fact and inform
about this particular part of history and culture.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
One particular task of the Low German professorates at Rostock University and Ernst
Moritz Arndt University in Greifswald (in this regard, cf. also the comments above on
subpara. (e) (ii) - "3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania") is to point out the extremely rich
history of Low German and its many and various cultural achievements. The impact of Low
German as a contact language (lingua franca) of the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions
during the Hanseatic era is one of the subjects of the Low German course of study. This
range of subjects is also supported by the chairs of History at Rostock University and by the
chair of Hanse Re search at Greifswald University.
Low German has, for centuries, moulded the particular identity of the autochthonous
population of Northern Germany. Until this day, the vernacular and the Low German culture
have continued to be the decisive features/characteristics of this Low German community.
The culture and history of this Low German region are imparted, in particular, by the
extremely diversified activities related to linguistic culture (e.g. by theatre groups, by Low
German authors, and by the Institut für Volkskunde (Wossidlo Archiv) [Institute for the
Study of the Material Culture and Customs (Wossidlo Archives)] at Rostock University, the
Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Land Union for Local and Re gional Traditions], the Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und
Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Institute of the Kulturbund for Folk Culture, Mecklenburg
and Western Pomerania] and the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und

184

Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and
Training).
5. Lower Saxony
Under the extended educational mandate laid down in the Lower Saxony Schools Act as
amended in 1993, pupils shall be enabled to develop their faculties of perception and
sensitivity and their capacity for expressing themselves, with the inclusion of the relevant
regional variety of Low German or of Frisia n.
Implementation of this mandate in classroom instruction can be supported by all school
subjects. Particularly suited are 'German', the subjects covered by world history and
geography and social sciences (history, geography, politics) as well as elementary science,
arts, music, and religious instruction; for vocational/technical schools, the preferred sub jects
are German and politics.
The Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs - in co-operation with schools, the
Niedersächsischer Heimatbund [Lower Saxony Union for Local and Regional Traditions],
the Landschaften or Landschaftsverbände [regional local authorities] and the Bezirk
Governments - develops a differentiated support system. In detail, this involves the
following:
The Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs - with the Decree on "Die Region im Unterricht" ["Our Region in classroom instruction"] (1997) and the Framework Curricula which
have already been revised on this basis - takes account of the required emphasis on regional
education in school subjects suited for the purpose. Through the completed pilot project
"Plattdeutsch in der Schule" ["Low German in school"], the school-based model test at the
Obenstrohe (Varel) secondary school, which also includes "Niederdeutsch im Unterricht"
["Low German in Classroom Instruction"] as one of the priority subjects, is to give a clear
idea of the way in which, and the extent to which, the Low German la nguage is imparted.
Also, following the "Model Test: Bilingualism in Nursery School", Low German is to be
included in the instruc tion given at primary schools in Ostfriesland.
At the level of the Bezirk Governments, the Commissioners for Low German in Classroom
Instruction who were first designated in 1997 have, in co-operation with representatives of
the Landschaften and Landschaftsverbände or of local associations, begun to establish
regional working panels. These latter are considered appropriate institutions for identifying
existing activities, pursued in and outside school with regard to the regional language, for
mutually complementing them and for improving them for the school sector through
regional further training.
Finally, the Bezirk Governments can, in the procedure for inviting applications for a
position, ind icate school-specific requirements in addition to the subjects to be taught by the
applicant. During job interviews, these special requirements, e.g. Low German in classroom
instruction, can be taken into account.
At the level of the schools, education department officers, especially the Commissioners for
Low German in Classroom Instruction, assist the various schools in their efforts to develop
a regional education concept, taking particular account of the regional language.
Within the framework of optional-subject courses and of courses in subjects chosen from a
compulsory group at Realschulen [secondary technical schools] and in courses in required

185

elective subjects at secondary modern schools, teachers already make use of the possibility
to offer Low German and to include it in marking.
The teaching material and learning aids developed by Ostfriesische Landschaft within the
framework of the pilot project "Plattdeutsch in der Schule" ["Low German in school"]
respond to the need of many teachers for appropriate educational material; they are based on
the extended educational mandate of schools, and take account of the pupils' previous
knowledge. Thus, in terms of their approach, they can be adapted to the work in other
regions. The same goes for the questionnaires developed for pupils and for teachers. With
the development of the teaching and learning system and of the survey instruments by
Ostfriesische Landschaft, the Land Government has provided basic prerequisites for modern
promotion of regional languages, which should now be applied in practice in the various
regions.
The task of supraregional specialist conferences, organized by Niedersächsischer Heimatbund [Lower Saxony Union for Local and Regional Traditions] in co-operation with the
Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs) in a three- year cycle, is to present the work of
these regional institutions from aspects of methodology/didactics and to interlink those
activities in a long-term perspective. The next specialist conference of this type will take
place in 2000, with presentations and working group meetings on the following subjects:
- Globalization: Is a sense of regional identity [regionalism] still up to date?
- Regionalism, as exemplified by the language and taking account of the educational
value of langua ge
- Meetings of working groups
- "Towards a School Programme - the region in classroom instruction"
- Regional languages in school
- Educational materials for unfolding the regional dimension
- Forms of classroom instruction for unfolding the regional dimension
Under the "Leitbild für die Schulaufsicht in Niedersachsen" ["Model for Supervisory School
Offices in Lower Saxony"], it is the responsibility, first of all, of the individual school to
achieve the pedagogical, subject-related and organizational objectives specified by State
authorities and agreed internally. This entails the task of the school to develop its regional
education concept on the basis of the State-defined requirements and of its competencies for
in-school and extracurricular activities. This can be done, for instance, in the course of the
development of the school programme. Aids are already provided by the results of the pilot
project "Plattdeutsch in der Schule" ["Low German in school"], and by further training
measures in various regions and at centres for environmental education, by the
documentation pub lished by regional working panels or school discussion groups dealing
with the region, e.g. from a linguistic, geographic, historical or economical angle.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
In North Rhine/Westphalia, the Guidelines and Curricula issued by the Schools Ministry
encourage the discussion and study of specific regional aspects. Thus, the Guidelines for the
Lower Secondary Grades of Gymnasien [grammar schools] call upon schools to develop a
school programme which, inter alia, will cover the "cultural traditions of the local
environment and home region". Regional la nguages are included in the learning field
"Reflexion über Sprache" ["Reflections on Language"] forming part of the grammar school
curriculum for the subject 'German'. Also the curricula for the secondary grades and for the

186

primary education level of schools of other types provide for inclusion of an adequate
proportion of regional languages in German lessons.
In addition, since the start of the new school year 1999, Low German lessons are given, or
are expertly supported, at Schalksmühle primary school by several members of the
Niederdeutscher Arbeitskreis [Low German Working Panel] of the Geschichtsverein
Schalksmühle [Schalksmühle Historical Society]. Also, a school in Lüdenscheid will offer
Low German instruction in future.
7. Saxony-Anhalt
In Saxony-Anhalt, language has, for many centuries, determined daily life. The Framework
Curricula for the subjects 'History' and 'German' take account of this fact and recommend to
provide information on the history, language and culture, for instance in connection with
regional or local topics.
Cf. also the comments above on sub-para. (b) (iv) [p. 154].
8. Schleswig- Holstein
The curricula of publicly maintained schools provide for many ways of including Low German in classroom instruction. Thus, the 'German' curriculum provides for the "discussion
and study of the languages and speech communities in Schleswig-Holstein".
Reference is made to the comments above on sub-paras. (b) iii [p. 153] and (c) iii [p. 158].

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Basic and Further Training of Teachers –
(h)

to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
The Landesinstitut für Schule [Land Institute for Schools] offers regular teacher follow-up
training in the Low German language and culture.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
While teachers can study Low German at Hamburg University and select it as a minor for
the M.A. examination, this is not possible as regards the examination for the teaching
profession at Hamburg University (at other universities, however, such inclusion is possible,
e.g. in Bremen). For the major part, teachers wishing to deal with Low German in school
have not studied this language at university; most of them know it from their childhood.
The Institut für Lehrerfortbildung [Teacher Follow-up Training Institute] offers continuing
education both on a regular basis and within the framework of special activities. The onetime course "Platt in de Grundschool" ["Low German in elementary school"] organized in
August 1999 had fifteen participants while the "Plattdüütsche Schoolmesterkrink" ["Low
German Teachers' Circle"], which met every two weeks, was attended by six to twelve
persons.

187

3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
University studies of Low German are based on the Training and Examination Regulations
of the Rostock and Greifswald Universities. Continuing training of teachers for schools
offering general education is governed by the provisions of the Schools Act. During the
second training phase at the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und
Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and
Training), teachers in training in the primary school sector or for the subject 'German' in
secondary schools can select and treat, from a pedagogical angle, topics referring to Low
German aspects, in their special-subject paper or the trial lessons to be prepared for the Final
State Examination. These are mostly instruction sequences which they have tried out
themselves in the classroom. These activities build up on, and continue, the Low German
training taken up at Greifswald University and the course of study followed at Rostock
University, with Low German as a main subject.
Since 1992, follow- up training of teachers for Low German in schools has been organized
by the Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A.). The
focus is on didactics/methodology support for teachers; in this respect, the principle of the
trainees' self- initiative and own work - in addition to information and reading lists - is an
important element.
Since the start of the 1997/1998 school year, follow- up training has, for the major part, been
offered on the basis of a modular concept, divided into basic courses, continuation courses
and special courses. These courses provide an appropriate framework for meeting different
requirements since they allow for a process of selection. The follow- up training organized
by the L.I.S.A. aims at encouraging novices to foster Low German at their schools, and at
providing novel, interesting suggestions through special topics offered to advanced learners.
Over the past few years, an Advisory Centre for Low German in Schools has developed at
L.I.S.A. headquarters. In addition to follow- up training, the Centre also offers materials,
publications, information and addresses of contact persons. Also, follow-up training activities on specific issues are carried out in close co-operation with the Landesheimatverband
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local
and Regional Traditions] and the Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und Vorpommern im
Kulturbund e.V. [Folk Culture Institute of the Kulturbund, Mecklenburg and Western
Pomerania].
For the first six- month period of the 1999/2000 school year, the L.I.S.A. Institute offers the
following further training for Low German:
- "Mecklenburgische Volksmusik: Musikanten und Instrumente des späten Mittelalters
und der frühen Neuzeit" ["Mecklenburg Folk Music: Musicians and Instruments of the
Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Age"]
- "Aust -Tied: Erntebräuche in Mecklenburg" ["Harvest Time: Folk Customs in
Mecklenburg"]
- "Richard Wossidlo - Professor des Volkes: Aus seinem Leben und seiner Sammlungstätigkeit" ["Richard Wossidlo - A Professor of the People: About His Life and
Collector's Activities"]
4. North Rhine/Westphalia

188

The Circular [Decree] on "Niederdeutsch in der Schule" ["Low German in school"], issued
by the Münster Bezirk Government, contains guidance on the inclusion of regional language
culture in the curricula. In addition, the Münster Bezirk Government offers follow-up
training conferences on linguistic theory and practice. A volume for use at such meetings
and entitled "Niederdeutsch in der Schule - Beiträge zur regionalen Zweisprachigkeit"
["Low German in school - material on regional bilingualism"] was published already in
1989.
5. Saxony-Anhalt
Training and continuing education of teachers in Saxony-Anhalt in the field of the Low
German la nguage are ensured, on the one hand, by the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch
[Workshop for Low German] of the Germanistisches Institut of Otto von Guericke
University in Magdeburg (Teacher Training: Aspects of Language Cultivation, and
Facultative Offers for Participants Interested in Linguistics) and, on the other hand, through
follow-up and further training activities offered on a regular basis by the Landesinstitut für
Lehrerfortbildung Sachsen-Anhalt (LISA - Saxony-Anhalt Land Institute for Follow-up
Training of Teachers) in co-operation with the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V.
[Saxony-Anhalt Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions]. In addition, many courses
and lectures on Low German and on regional Low German history take place every year at
Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg and Martin Luther University in Halle, and
teacher follow-up training activities on the Low German spoken in Saxony-Anhalt and on
regional Low German history in the Land are carried out by the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch.
6. Schleswig- Holstein
Training and continuing education of teachers are regulated in Training and Examination
Regulations. In future, proof of attendance of a course in Low German or Frisian will be
required for admission to the Final State Examinations in the subject 'German'.
As part of a supplementary course of study for the teaching profession for all schools, which
comprises about 20 hours a week per semester, an additional exam can be taken in Low
German and Frisian.
Within the limits of the capacities available, colleges and universities offer further training
in Low German. In the 1998 summer semester, the Universities of Kiel and Flensburg
introduced Low German seminars for students training to become teachers for all types of
schools.
The Low German Language and Literature Department of Kiel University provides advisory
services on a continuous basis, including counselling for teachers, who also have access to
the holdings of its library.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (i) - Supervisory Bodies –
(i)

to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing
the teaching of regional or minority languages and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings which will be made public.

1. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg

189

The 'German Language' Section of the Authority for Schools, Youth, and Vocational
Training has been assigned the responsibility for the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages.
The Hamburg Institut für Lehrerfortbildung (IfL - Teacher Follow-up Training Institute)
provides support for specialist teachers who receive further training, or additional
qualifications in teaching, in the regional language Low German and the minority language
Romany. The Institute keeps a list of the activities offered at Hamburg schools, which are
reported in the Institute's periodical publication "IfL aktuell".
With regard to any extension required or the qualification of the offered courses, the
responsible lecturers of the Institute confer with the supervisory school authorities and with
the 'German La nguage' Section of the Senate Authority for Schools.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
In publications and on the occasion of further training activities or at meetings, the
Landesinstitut Mecklenburg-Vorpommern für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Institute for Schools and Training) provides
information on the situation of Low German at the general-education schools in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
In 1996, the Ministry of Education founded a Niederdeutsch-Beirat MecklenburgVorpommern [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Low German Consultative Council]. This
body has 15 members and is chaired by the Minister of Education. The members of the
Niederdeutsch-Beirat represent all main subject areas (schools, science and research,
linguistic and cultural work). The Niederdeutsch-Beirat has the function to discuss and
network the various Low German activities in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. For more
efficient and effective use of the staffing and financial resources, knowledge of the main
study areas in the various fields of activity relating to Low German is essential. Moreover,
there is an urgent requirement for discussing and handling a large number of subjects
regarding the cultivatio n and promotion of Low German.
3. Lower Saxony
In November 1997, a Working Group was established, with representatives from the
Landschaften and Landschaftsverbände [regional local authorities], the Niedersächsischer
Heimatbund [Lower Saxony Union for Local and Regional Traditions] and the schools
offices. The task of this Working Group is to monitor the proper implementation of the
obligations under the Charter which have been accepted by the Land.
Responsibility for the preparation and regular publication of the Report on Education lies
with the Lower Saxony Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
At primary schools, secondary modern schools and Realschulen [secondary technical
schools], the Education Offices [supervisory school authorities] of the Kreise/kreisfreie
Städte [county-type administrative districts/non-district municipalities] are responsible for
supervising the measures taken. For the Gymnasien [grammar schools], comprehensive

190

schools and vocational schools, responsibility for supervision lies with the Ministry for
Education, Science, Research and Cultural Affairs.
Among the tasks of the supervisory school authorities are the co-ordination and monitoring
of measures taken for the promotion of Low German. Respons ibility for subject-specific
matters lies with the Land Commissioners for Follow-up Training, the regional
commissioners and the Kreis specia list commissioners.
Nordfriesland, for instance, has the "Plattdütsche Stuuv" ["Low German Parlour"], a centre
installed at the initiative of the supervisory school authority. It runs a lending library for
Low German writings. At the same time, it is a meeting place for teachers interested in Low
German.
As an important measure for cultivating and promoting Low German in and outside school,
the two "Zentren für Niederdeutsch" ["Centres for Low German"] for the Land regions of
Schleswig (in Leck) and Holstein (in Ratzeburg) were established as working centres by the
Land Government in 1994. As of August 2000, the teachers temporarily assigned to those
Centres are released from their regular teaching duties, amounting to two established posts.
The task of the two Centres for Low German is to advise the schools, providing bodies for
education and further education, individuals, associations and other organizations dealing
with Low German, and to support and, where appropriate, to co-ordinate their activities.
This includes the development of support and guidance materials for designing/organizing
classroom instruction. A landmark activity is the production of readers which were
developed in close co-operation with the foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg. As part of their
tasks, the Centres for Low German Public Information/Education pursue specific public
information/education activities.
The Institut für Praxis und Theorie der Schule (IPTS - Institute for Practical and Theoretical
School Matters) also supports the schools. Five regional commissioners, one Land and
Further Training Commissioner and ten Kreis commissioners advise the schools on matters
regarding the regional language Low German.

re: Art. 8, para. 2
(2)

With regard to education and in respect of territories other than
those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally
used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or
minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the
appropriate stages of education.

191

As regards colleges and universities, the obligation - in the sense of "undertake ... to allow" is met for the entire territory of the Federal Republic by virtue of Article 5, para. 3, of the
Basic Law (autonomy of institutions of higher education* ).
1. North Rhine/Westphalia
This obligation is met in North Rhine/Westphalia in the sense of "undertake ... to allow".
Any instruction - at colleges and universities - in the regional language Low German is, of
course, "allowed" also in Land regions other than those where the regional language is
spoken. A State- imposed ban, with regard to institutions of higher education, would not be
compatible with the constitutional provisions of Article 5, para. 3, of the Basic Law.
2. Schleswig- Holstein
This obligation is met in Schleswig-Holstein in the sense of "undertake ... to allow".

Article 9
Judicial Authorities
(1)
The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which
the number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies
the measures specified below, according to the situation of each of these
languages and on condition that the use of the facilities afforded by the
present paragraph is not considered by the judge to hamper the proper
administration of justice:
re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) - Civil Proceedings (b)

in civil proceedings:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

This obligation has been explicitly accepted by the Länder of Bremen, Hamburg,
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia and SchleswigHolstein.
With the proviso that documents and evidence drafted in a minority language must be presented in a form obviating misunderstandings or errors with regard to the ir translation, this
obligation is met by the legal situation prevailing in Germany (cf. the comments, in Part C
above [p. 43], on obligations under Part III, Article 9). Therefore, it has not been necessary
to take any special measures.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Proceedings before Courts concerning Administrative Matters –

*

"(3) Art and scholarship, research, and teaching shall be free. The freedom of teaching ..."

192

(c)

in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
(iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the
regional or minority languages,
if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

This obligation has been explicitly accepted by the Länder of Bremen, Hamburg,
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia and SchleswigHolstein.
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iii).
As regards this branch of the judiciary, it must be pointed out that administrative courts are
obliged to conduct ex officio investigations and, where necessary and appropriate, will on
their own initiative rely on the services of interpreters. Thus, the members of the language
group suffer no prejudice by using their language.

193

re: Art. 9, para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Validity of Legal Documents –
(2)

The Parties undertake:
(a)
not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within
the State solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority
language; or

This obligation has been explicitly accepted by the Länder of Brandenburg, Bremen,
Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia,
Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig- Holstein.
In this regard, reference is made to the comments on Article 9, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (iii).

Article 10
Administrative Authorities and Public Services
(1)
Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the
measures specified below and according to the situation of each language,
the Parties undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:
re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) v - Submission of Documents –
(a)

(v)
to ensure that users of regional or minority languages may
validly submit a document in these languages;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
With the entry into force of the Regional/Minority Language Charter as of 1 January 1999,
the provision under sub-para. (v) has become applicable law for the authorities of the Free
Hanseatic City of Bremen. In order to stem the flood of legal rules, the Hanseatic City of
Bremen will refrain from adopting any special administrative regulations referring to the
existing applicable legal provisions.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In Hamburg, as in Bremen (cf. the foregoing comments under "1."), it is possible to submit
documents drafted in Low German to the authorities. No use has so far been made of this
facility by members of this language group.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Notwithstanding the applied principle of using German as the official language, Section 23
of the Land Administrative Procedure Act does not, on principle, rule out use of Low
German. Accordingly, documents drafted in Low German, e.g. purchase deeds, etc., can be
submitted in this regional language.

194

4. Lower Saxony
Submission of legal documents in the Low German language is admissible. So far, no
information is available regarding the extent to which members of this language group have
actually made use of this facility.
5. Schleswig- Holstein
The legal basis for acceptance of this obligation by the Land of Schleswig- Holstein is
Section 82a, para. 2, of the Land Administration Act. This discretionary regulation provides
for the general possibility to submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other
documents in a foreign language, i.e. a language other than the official language.
"Section 82 a - Official Language
(1) The official language is German.
(2) If applications or petitions, records, deeds or other documents drafted in a foreign
language are submitted to an authority, the latter can require a translation to be
produced. (...)"
According to a non-representative survey carried out among subordinate agencies of the
Ministry of the Interior of Schleswig-Holstein Land, use is made of this possibility, inter
alia, by land survey offices [cadastral offices] and by the Land Statistical Office.
In this context it should be noted that, according to the legal commentary by Foerster,
Friedersen and Rohde (as of 2/97; no. 1, para. 4, regarding Section 82a of the Land
Administration Act), the term 'German language' not only covers standard German, but also
dialects, including the Low German language. This is also in conformity with the
supremecourt decisions on the parallel regulation applying to courts, in Section 184 of the
Organization of the Courts Act. The prerequisite, however, is that all parties involved
understand the dialect. To this extent, the obligation is already met for Low German.
Following this commentary, though, Low German would not be considered a language in its
own right, but a dialect - and as such would not come under the Regional/Minority
Language Charter. Linguistically, however, it is an established fact that Low German is an
independent language differing from standard (High) German.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) - Drafting of Documents –
(c)

to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a
regional or minority language.

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (a) (v) - "1.
Bremen".
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (a) (v) - "2.
Hamburg".

195

3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
In this area, the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages has already had the
effect that, for instance, documents, speeches, letters and messages of greeting are written in
Low German both within the Land Administration and in local administrations. Hanse Sail
1999, in Rostock, and the Landeskulturtage [Land Cultural Days], in Waren-Müritz, were
opened by the Minister-President of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land in Low
German. This means significant upgrading and recognition of Low German. To the extent
possible, Low German letters sent by citizens will also be answered in Low German.
The employment of Low German Commissioners within the Land Administration and local
administrations should be examined in a long-term perspective. The task of such
Commissioners for Low German could be to develop concepts for increasing (oral/written)
proficiency in the Low German language in administration.
4. Lower Saxony
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (a) (v) - "4.
Lower Saxony".
In the context of a survey carried out among the Ostfriesland local authorities, however, the
respondents assessed the scope for using Low German, also as a written language within the
administration, as rather negative - for reasons of feasibility (their staff members cannot
write this language) and of practical need (many speakers of Low German can read their
language only with difficulty).
5. Schleswig- Holstein
This obligation has been accepted by Schleswig- Holstein in the sense of "undertake ... to
allow". Cf. also the general comments above on Article 10, para. 1, sub-para. (a) (v) ["2. Schleswig- Holstein"].
In particular, written messages of greeting for events related to Low German issues are quite
frequently drafted in the Low German language. Also, a number of documents have already
been drawn up in Low German. Thus, for instance, the Minister-President used the Low
German language in a letter addressed by her to the Bremen-based Institut für
Niederdeutsche Sprache [Institute for the Low German Language].
The Ministry for Rural Areas, Town and Country Planning, Agriculture and Tourism of
Schleswig- Holstein Land presents the introductory page of the Land Government's Internet
site also in the regional language Low German ("Düsse sied op platt") ["This page in Low
German"], in addition to Danish and North Frisian.

re: Art. 10, para. 2
(2)
In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory
the number of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is
such as to justify the measures specified below, the Parties undertake to
allow and/or encourage:*

196

re: para. 2, sub-para. (a) - Use of a Regional or Minority Language
(a)
the use of regional or minority languages within the
framework of the regional or local authority;
This accepted obligation - like the other obligations under paragraph 2 - is generally met by
the Länder at least in the sense of "undertake to allow". Therefore, the members of this
language group are free to make use of the pertinent provisions also in everyday life. If at
all, this is at present done in a few cases only. However, practical implementation of this
obligation very much depends on whether, and how many, staff members of the respective
authorities have a command of the Low German language. To the extent that implementation measures in addition to the general applicability of this provision can be taken, or where
Länder already have practical experience in this regard, examples are given below.
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
With the entry into force of the Regional/Minority Language Charter as of 1 January 1999,
this provision has become applicable law for the authorities of the Free Hanseatic City of
Bremen. Specific measures have not been taken.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In Hamburg, Civil Registry Offices can, upon request, conduct marriage ceremonies in the
Low German language.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Under Section 23 of the Land Administrative Procedure Act, the official language is
German. The German language, by definition, also comprises all dialects and, regarding the
official language, also covers Low German as a regional language. Thus, the use of Low
German as an official language is not generally precluded by the principle of German being
the official language as stipulated in Section 23 of the Land Administrative Procedure Act.
Use of Low German within the framework of regional or local authorities depends on
whether suitable staff members having a command of Low German are available within the
given administration.
Stavenhagen, the [native] town of [the Low German writer Fritz] Reuter, in May designated
a female official of the Civil Registry Office as the Low German Commissioner. It is now
possible to perform marriage ceremonies also in Low German.
Another example of the active use of the Low German language is presented by Staatliches
Museum in Schwerin where guided tours of the museum are regularly conducted in Low
German. Also guided city tours conducted in Low German, e.g. in the Land capital
Schwerin, are very popular.
The Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions, reg'd] has developed a sticker
"Ick snack platt" ["I speak Low German"] and a cup with the same inscription. These
objects indicate the person's language proficiency, and 'canvass' for Low German.
These are only a few examples from among a wide range of other initiatives within the Land
of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where Low German is also used within authorities at

197

the regional level. In this respect, a good basis has been provided which can be further
developed in all areas.
4. Lower Saxony
In coastal regions of Lower Saxony, particularly in rural areas, many municipalities and
other local governments employ staff proficient in the Low German language. In Ostfriesland and Ammerland, information on bilingualism is provided region-wide, for instance
with reference to the registration of newly born children with the competent authority.
In addition, [civil] marriage ceremonies can be performed in Low German. Also at official
events, representatives of the Land or of local governments give speeches in Low German.
In Ostfriesland and in Ammerland, representatives of Landkreise [rural administrative
districts] and local governments have formed working panels dealing specifically with the
implementation of Article 10 of the Charter.
5. Schleswig- Holstein
Use of Low German within the framework of regional or local authorities depends on
whether staff members having a command of Low German are available within the given
administration. Even though no statistical data are available on the use of Low German in
this field, it can be assumed that, especially in rural communities, people communicate also
in Low German.
Thus, for instance, the town of Schleswig has this year distributed stickers inscribed "Ick
snack Platt" ["I speak Low German"] to those staff members who speak Low German so as
to reduce any inhibitions which visitors might still have with regard to the use of the
regional language in their dealings with public agencies or authorities.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (b) - Submission of Applications –
(b)
the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to
submit oral or written applications in these languages;

1. Brandenburg
This provision concerns local self-administration units. It is not known whether - and if so,
to what extent - citizens have so far submitted oral or written applications in the Low
German language to local authorities; in this regard, no statistical data are collected.
If a citizen submits an application drafted in Low German to an official who does not know
the Low German language, it usually is easily possible to arrive at a practical solution by
calling in another staff member speaking that language.
It is not planned to issue administrative rules for the specific regulation of the treatment of
applications drafted in the Low German language since there is no apparent practical need
for such a regulation. So far, no case has become known where a pragmatic solution was not
found.

198

2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on sub-para. (a) - "1. - Bremen".
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
It is possible to submit texts drafted in Low German to the Hamburg Administration, but no
use was made of this possibility in the years 1998 and 1999.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Under Section 23 of the Land Administrative Procedure Act, Low German may be used for
oral and written communication within local and regional authorities.
5. Lower Saxony
Applications may be submitted in the regional language. Cf. also the comments below on
para. 4, sub-para. (a).
6. Schleswig- Holstein
The general possibility to submit applications, petitions, records, deeds or other documents
in a foreign language - i.e. a language other than the official language - derives from
Section 82a, para. 2, of the Land Administrative Procedure Act.
In all other respects, reference is made to the comments above on Article 10, para. 1, subpara. (a) v.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (c) - Publication of Official Documents of the Regional Authority in
the Regional Language –
(c)
the publication by regional authorities of their official
documents also in the rel evant regional or minority languages;
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. (a) - "1. Bremen".
2. Lower Saxony
Also the regional authorities of Lower Saxony employ staff having knowledge of the
regional la nguage. However, publication of official documents in Low German meets with
some reserve. But on a case-by-case basis, the question as to whether such action is
expedient and/or effective as regards the intended addressees will be considered.

199

re: para. 2, sub-para. (d) - Publication of Official Documents of Local Authorities in the
Regional Language –
(d)
the publication by local authorities of their official
documents also in the relevant regional or minority languages;
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. (a) - "1. Bremen".
2. Lower Saxony
The publication of official documents in Low German is admissible in the Land of Lower
Saxony, and is not hampered by any legal stipulations. A survey conducted in the main
settlement area in the Ostfriesland region of this Land has shown that, at present, the various
local authorities have not yet established such publication practices.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (e) - Use by Regional Authorities of the Minority Language in Debates
in Their Assemblies –
(e)
the use by regional authorities of regional or minority
languages in debates in their assemblies, without excluding,
however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. (a) - "1. Bremen".
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Interpellations and questions in Low German have occasionally been presented in the CityState Parliament [Bürgerschaft] and District Councils. As a rule, these were discussed and
answered in Low German.
3. Lower Saxony
So far, no empirical data are available. Where relevant, the respective authorities may include appropriate regulations in their Rules of Procedure.

re: para. 2, sub-para. (f) - Use by Local Authorities of the Minority Language in Debates in
Their Assemblies –
(f)
the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages
in debates in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use
of the official language(s) of the State;
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. (a) - "1. Bremen".

200

2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. (e) - "2. Hamburg".
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
In local and regional assemblies, the Low German language is used by the councillors. In
1992, for instance, the assembly of the town of Anklam held meetings in Low German.
In rural areas, use of Low German is more frequent and widespread.
4. Lower Saxony
In various places, the Council meetings are often held in Low German or are bilingual (Low
German/German).
5. Schleswig- Holstein
The provision is implemented, inter alia, by the Schleswig-Holstein Land Ministry of the
Interior which, in response to pertinent inquiries made by local authorities or local
government supervisory authorities, will refer to Article 10, para. (2) (f), of the Charter and
to the possibility to conduct assembly meetings in Low German.
In rural areas, in particular, it is quite common to hold meetings of local councils in Low
German, provided that nobody objects to the use of this language.
On 21 June 1999, the town of Schleswig conducted a council meeting "op platt", i.e. in Low
German. Also, various Kreistag meetings were, either for their full length or in part, held in
Low German.
re: Art. 10, para. 3
(3)
With regard to public services provided by the administrative
authorities or other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake,
within the territory in which regional or minority languages are used, in
accordance with the situation of each language and as far as this is
reasonably possible:
(a)
to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used in
the provision of the service; or
(b)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a
request and receive a reply in these languages; or
(c)
to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a
request in these languages.
The obligation under sub-paragraph (c) has been entered into by the Land of Brandenburg.
Sub-paragraph (c) covers the undertaking to allow persons wishing to use the Low German
language to do so when submitting a request. This is interpreted by the Land Government to
imply an obligation to refrain from action: the Land may not bar or prevent the use of the
Low German language for the submission of requests; and this is ensured since there is no

201

legal provision or administrative regulation prohibiting the use of the Low German language
for the submission of requests to administrative authorities. Any positive regulation laying
down that use of the Low German la nguage is admissible in this context is not considered
necessary and therefore is not intended to be introduced.
In all other respects, the comments above on paragraph 2, sub-para. (b) [Submission of
Applications], apply mutatis mutandis.

re: Art. 10, para. 4
(4)
With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2
and 3 accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the
following measures:
re: para. 4, sub-para. (a) - Translation or Interpretation
(a)

translation or interpretation as may be required;

This obligation has been accepted by the Land of Lower Saxony.
Since the authorities of those regions where Low German is spoken, usually also employ
staff having a knowledge of the regional language, problems will not be encountered as
regards translation or interpretation. At any rate, no deficits have so far become known.

re: para. 4, sub-para. (c) - Appointment of Public Service Employees having a Knowledge
of a Regional or Minority Language –
(c)

compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to
be appointed in the territory in which that language is used.

1. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Applications for re-assignments have not yet been submitted by public service employees
wishing to be appointed in the territory in which Low German is used. In some District
Council Offices, ho wever, employees were asked whether they spoke Low German so that
they might, if required, be appointed to appropriate posts.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
The Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania variety of Low German is spoken throughout this
Land so that, e.g. in the appointment of teachers, administrative employees, nursery-school
teachers and doctors, account can be taken of individuals proficient in the Low German
language.
This fact does not, however, establish any causal relationship between the Low German
proficiency of public service employees and the definitive assignment of the place of
employment.
3. Lower Saxony

202

The Land of Lower Saxony does not apply any restrictions as regards the wishes of public
service employees for appointment to posts where they can make use of their knowledge of
the Low German language. So far, no information is available on any cases where such
requests have been made and employees have actually been appointed to such posts.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
With a view to implementing this obligation, an announcement to this effect was made at
the Personalreferentenkonferenz (PRK - Conference of Personnel Officers) on 24 June
1999. The PRK brings together the personnel officers of the supreme Land authorities at
regular meetings with the aim of co-ordinating and harmonizing the essential crossdepartmental decisions in the field of personnel management.
If a staff member within the Land Administration expresses a wish regarding such an
appointment, the scope for complying with the request will be examined. So far, however,
there have been no requests to this effect at the Land Government level.
In the case of Low German, in particular, the practical relevance of the PRK announcement
would seem to be negligible since Low German, as a regional langua ge, is spoken
throughout the Land.

Article 11
Media
(1)
The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority
languages within the territories in which those languages are spoken,
according to the situation of each language, to the extent that the public
authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role
in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:
re: para. 1, sub-para. (b) ii - Broadcasting of Radio Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
1. Brandenburg
In the Land of Brandenburg, radio and television broadcasts of Norddeutscher Rundfunk
(NDR) of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen (see also the comments below - "2. Bremen")
can be received in the Low German speech area. In part, the NDR broadcasts are taken over
by Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) in its own programme schedule.

2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen

203

The Radio Bremen station has, for many years already, broadcast regular Low German
programmes. These are radio plays, local/regional programmes on weekends, Low German
news and Low German magazine programmes (Sünndagsradio - "Sunday Radio"). The
station urges its editors and anchormen and anchorwomen to include Low German in the
programme. The station produces its own Low German programme sections which are
transmitted over the four sound broadcasting fr equency bands [i.e. FM, LF, MF, and HF).
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Inter-State Treaty on Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) in many and various respects
takes account of the interests of the Low German language. Thus, the programming mandate
under Section 5 of the Inter-State Treaty contains the stipulation that "adequate room must
be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture and language". The radio
broadcasting programme of "Hamburg-Welle 90.3" covers regular broadcasts in Low
German (on Sundays: "Wi snackt Platt" ["We speak Low German"]; on weekdays, the news
are read in Low German once per day). Once per month, the public event "Sonntakte*" is
transmitted by Hamburg-Welle and often contains programme parts in Low German.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Both in the NDR programme Radio Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (RMV) and in the
programme of Antenne Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Low German has regular broadcasting
times and enjoys unfla gging popularity.
Since the Low German sector is represented also by a representative of the cultural sector on
the Land Broadcasting Board, consideration has to be given, on a case-by-case basis, to the
possibilities for including Low German also in the context of 'Open Channels'.
5. Lower Saxony
Under the Inter-State Treaty on Norddeutscher Rundfunk which was concluded by the Free
and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the Länder of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower
Saxony and Schleswig- Holstein, the programming mandate of Norddeutscher Rundfunk, as
a broadcasting corporation under public law, stipulates, inter alia, that adequate room must
be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture and language (Section 5,
para. 2, of the NDR Inter-State Treaty).
The Broadcasting Centres of the Länder produce Land programmes, as a full-day radio and
regional programmes on TV, which present, inter alia, the cultural and social life of the respective Land (Section 3, para. 3, of the NDR Inter-State Treaty). This also covers various
broadcasts in the Low German language, either at fixed broadcasting times or in the context
of current affairs reporting.
The programme of NDR 1 Radio Niedersachsen [Radio Lower Saxony] covers regular daily
thematic sections, including the pastoral talk in Low German ("plattdeutsche Ansprache").
In addition, there are two 1- hour Low German thematic broadcasts in Low German and two
Low German radio plays per month. Also, a weekly 2-hour magazine programme is
presented in Low German.

204

Generally it is to be noted that the airtime (in minutes) devoted by Norddeutscher Rundfunk
to Low German broadcasts over the past years has, in most areas, remained constant, and in
some cases has even been increased.
The Lower Saxony Land Broadcasting Act lays down that the programmes of private
broadcasters must make appropriate allowance also for the cultural diversity of the regions
and for the regional languages used in Lower Saxony (Section 17, para. 2, of the Land
Broadcasting Act). Compliance with these requirements is also monitored by the minimum
number of 41 members of the Assembly of the Lower Saxony Land Supervisory Authority
for Private Broadcasters. All major groups of society or organizations of the Land are
entitled to make nominations as regards representation on the Assembly.
In the past, the radio station Hit-Radio Antenne broadcast a programme featuring a comedy
figure speaking Low German, and now is planning further regional- language activities as
part of its regional programme.
On the other hand, the radio station radio ffn does not provide programme sections in
minority languages because it considers that integration of such broadcasts would be very
difficult in a private medium striving for success and catering for a mass audience.
Niedersächsischer Landesrundfunkausschuss, the Land supervisory authority for private
broadcasters of Lower Saxony, also supports non-commercial local broadcasters and the
'Open Channels'. It is especially in these programmes with a focus on regional and local
settings that specific cultural features and linguistic minorities are included and presented.
The multifarious programme structure of the Open Channels and local broadcasting stations
provides for Low German broadcasts, some of them on a regular basis. Thus, for instance,
Offener Kanal Emsland - Grafschaft Bentheim on Wednesdays and Thursdays airs a 1- hour
Low German programme. Radio Jade broadcasts Low German news every day at 16.30
hours, and once per month, on Wednesdays, airs a 2- hour broadcast entitled "Wi snackt platt
- för jeden wat" ["We speak Low German - something for everybody"]. Also, Offener Kanal
Osnabrück airs a half-our programme ent itled "Wi küert platt" on Wednesdays.
Also in view of their own interest, broadcasters strive to meet the legal requirements. In
addition, the Land of Lower Saxony - within the limits of its scope for exerting an influence
- encourages radio and television broadcasters to take account of regional special features of
the culture and language.
6. Saxony-Anhalt
In Saxony-Anhalt, radio and TV broadcasting corporations under public law as well as
private broadcasters regularly air programmes in the Low German language and report on
Low German events.
In the Northern part of Saxony-Anhalt, radio and TV broadcasts of Norddeutscher Rundfunk
(NRD) can be received in the Low German speech area. In part, broadcasts of Ostdeutscher
Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) are taken over by Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (mdr) in its own
programme schedule.
In Saxony-Anhalt, Open Channels and local broadcasting stations are still in the process of
organization but, depending on local demand, already include Low German broadcasts in

205

their programmes (for instance, Magdeburger Lokalsender: live broadcast of the Land elimination contest regarding the 1999 Low German Reading Competition).
7. Schleswig- Holstein
In a letter of 29 September 1999, the Minister-President of Schleswig-Holstein Land has
encouraged the station programme directors of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Zweites
Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF - Second German Television, or Channel II),
DeutschlandRadio, Radio Schleswig-Holstein, NORA (NordOstseeRAdio), delta radio and
POWER RADIO Nord to integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the features
determining the specificity of our Land" in their programmes; intens ification of first action
already taken in this respect would be welcomed. In the spirit of the Regional/Minority
Language Charter, the Minister-President urged that "further avenues should be explored for
integrating contributions in the minority languages and in the regional la nguage Low
German into their programmes, as a service for the citizens and in support of this element of
the culture of Schleswig-Holstein".
In addition, the following provisions have been laid down:
Ÿ The broadcasting corporation under public law (NDR) has the legal mandate to report on
the cultural diversity and the special features of the respective Land and to give its
support to the protection of minorities.
Ÿ Adequate room must be given in the programme to the North German region, its culture
and language.
Ÿ Programming principles for private broadcasting: "programmes shall help to (...) achieve
protection and promotion of minorities".
Ÿ Protected minorities have access to the media, and scope for participation, on the same
conditions as other groups of society. The provisions of the Land Broadcasting Act
promote programming diversity and the variety of broadcasters.
Ÿ The Land Broadcasting Act was amended in 1999. In future, the previous Assembly of
the supervisory authority Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR - the
Schleswig- Holstein Land broadcasting institution for private broadcasters) will be
replaced by a Media Council. Any socially relevant group, organization or association of
supraregional stand ing is entitled to make nominations for the election of the Media
Council.
Ÿ In addition, the ULR operates two radio broadcasting 'Open Channels' in SchleswigHolstein. Through these Open Channels, anybody who is not a broadcaster himself, can
disseminate his or her own contributions via radio broadcasting.
The legal bases include:
Inter-State Treaty on Norddeutscher Rundfunk [NDR State Treaty] (of 1 March 1992):
Article 3, para. 3; Article 5, para. 2, 1 st sentence; Article 7, para. 2, 3rd sentence;
Inter-State Agreement on the Public Corporation "Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen" (of 26
January 1998): Article 5, para. 2;
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 17, para. 2, nos. 1 and 2; Section 24,
para. 3; Section 34, para. 1, 1st - 3rd sentences; Section 54, para. 3.
Examples of pertinent broadcasts are:
The sound broadcasting department of Landesfunkhaus [Land Broadcasting Centre] in Kiel
has a Low German central office. The latter is reponsible for the regular programme "Low
German Radio Play" and the programme "Niederdeutsche Chronik" ["Low German
Chronicle"].

206

NDR 1 - Welle Nord airs many Low German programmes:
Ÿ "Von Binnenland und Waterkant" ["Inland and Seaside Life"]
Ÿ "Bi uns to Huus" ["At home, in our region"] (parts are in Low German)
Ÿ "Hör mal'n beten to" ["Just listen for a bit"]
Ÿ "Ünner't Strohdack" ["Under the thatch roof"] (North German reading)
Ÿ "Vertell doch mal" ["Tell me ..."] (Low German story-telling competition)*
In addition, there are broadcasts with Low German sections (consumer topics in Low
German, the Low German weekly review, and the Low German morning prayers).
Also, at irregular intervals, Radio Schleswig-Holstein (R.SH) airs [Low German] broadcasts
dispersed throughout its overall programme.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (c) ii - Broadcasting of Television Programmes –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television
programmes in the regional or minority languages on a regular
basis;
1. Brandenburg
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on Article 11, para. (1), sub-para.
(b) (ii) - "1. - Brandenburg".
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In Bremen, the Nativity story is broadcast in Low German regularly during Christmastide.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The broadcasting station N 3 of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) regulars broadcasts the talk
show "Talk op Platt" ["Talk in Low German"]. The daily "Hamburg Journal" programme
reports on local events and, occasionally, on events in which Low German plays a special
role.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
The television Land programme of Landesfunkhaus Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Broadcasting Centre] only sometimes features the
Low German language in occasional broadcasts as part of the programmes "Nordmagazin"
["Magazine of the North"], "Zwischen Elbe und Oder" ["Region between the Elbe and Oder
Rivers"], "Mecklenburg-Vorpommern heute" ["Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania today"].
At present, it is not planned to produce specific Low German programmes.
The same goes for feature broadcasts produced by Landesfunkhaus MecklenburgVorpommern for Norddeutsches Fernsehen N 3, which also only occasionally include Low
German texts or songs.
Regarding the TV programme of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), particular mention is to
be made of the programme "Talk op platt" ["Talk in Low German"]. This two-hour live

207

broadcast is aired six times per year on TV Channel III of NDR from different places in the
transmission area, inter alia from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The editorial office for
this programme, which is exclusively in Low German, is located in Hamburg.

208

5. Lower Saxony
Cf. the general comments above on Art. 11, para. 1, sub-para. (b) (ii) "5. - Lower Saxony".
Norddeutscher Rundfunk - the broadcasts of which are received in the Low German speech
area Lower Saxony Land - regularly airs the talk show "Talk op Platt" ["Talk in Low
German"] and stage productions of Ohnsorg Theater. In addition, entertainment
programmes such as "Bi uns to Hus" ["At home, in our region"] and "Melodie der Meere"
["Melody of the Seas"] often feature poems and songs in the Low German language. Lower
Saxony has its own 10- minute Low German broadcast which is aired every second Friday.
6. Saxony-Anhalt
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on Article 11, para. 1, sub-para. (b)
(ii) - "6. Saxony-Anhalt".
7. Schleswig- Holstein
In this regard, reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (b) (ii) - "7.
Schleswig- Holstein".
In addition, it should be noted that the Schleswig-Holstein-Magazin - which is aired daily,
except on Sundays, from 19.30 - 20.00 o'clock - includes broadcasts on the Low German
language, e.g. the talk show Talk op Platt" ["Talk in Low German"] and the transmission of
stage productions of Ohnsorg-Theater.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Audio and Audiovisual Works –
(d)

to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of
audio and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

1. Brandenburg
The Land of Brandenburg has implemented this obligation especially by means of
legislative measures. The ORB's obligation is anchored in Section 5, para. 2, of the Act on
Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB Act), i.e. in fulfilment of its programming
mandate, to rely on private-sector providers and services and in this regard to include
production firms Brandenburg Land. This obligation also benefits the producers and
distributors of audio and audiovisual productions in the northern region of the Land, which
is part of the Low German speech and cultural area.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Some of the productions of Radio Bremen - Plattdeutsche Nachrichten [Low German
News], Plattdeutscher Sprachkursus für Anfänger [Low German Language Course for
Beginners] - (cf. the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (b) (ii) - "1. - Bremen") are
disseminated, as texts with audio versions, on the Internet. The standard German version of
the Low German news can, at any time, be retrieved from Radio Bremen-Online.

209

3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Hamburg, as an important media site, welcomes the production of pertinent audio and
audiovisual works by Hamburg-based media companies.
Radio and TV broadcasts in the regional language Low German are aired by Norddeutscher
Rundfunk - N 3. Radio-play musicassettes are used in classroom instruction for the subjects
'German' and 'music'.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
As part of cultural promotion, various projects for language promotion by audiovisual
means have been carried out. Interesting materials for Low German instruction are, for
instance, the video "Norddeutsche Märchen und Sagen" ["North German Folk Tales and
Legends"] produced by Hagenow Kreis Adult Education Centre, the audio cassette
"Plattdütsch for juch" ["Low German for you"] produced by Landesheimatverband
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and
Regional Traditions, reg'd], the cassette "Oll Hinning vertellt" ["Old Hinning telling his
tales"] by Karl- Heinz Madauß / Parchim, and the CD edited by Werner Völschow and
published by the "Nordkurier" newspaper and containing texts from Fritz Reuter's work
"Dörchläuchting" ["Serene Highness"].
The Stiftung Mecklenburg in Ratzeburg, a foundation jointly subsidized by SchleswigHolstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, collects Low German films which also can
be viewed at the Foundation headquarters. The 'Media Workshop' provides comprehensive
information on the fullest range possible of persons and groups working in the Low German
sector (reciters/readers, theatre groups, singer-songwriters, radio and TV programmes, etc.).
The technical information levels depend on the collected material (CD, video, cassettes,
etc.). The material and information offered by the Stiftung Mecklenburg are designed, in
particular, for children and youngsters. Another aim is to collect speech samples through
interviews. Also, video cameras are available for reviewing one's own rehearsals of theatre
scenes.
5. Lower Saxony
The programming principles for public broadcasting corporations, as stipulated in the NDR
Inter-State Treaty, and those for private broadcasters, as laid down in the Land
Broadcasting Act - which are described above (cf. the comments under para. 1, subparas. b
and c) - are also intended to provide incentives for the production and dissemination of
audio and audiovisual works in the Low German language.
Upon application, the Land of Lower Saxony, in view of supporting such productions within
the framework of cultural promotion, grants subsidies to the production costs.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
In the context of the preservation of regional traditions, the Landschaftsverband [regional
local authority] Westfalen-Lippe which promotes the Low German language mainly in the
cultural sector (see also the comments below on Article 12) subsidizes the production costs

210

of sound recordings regarding Low German subjects. The production and dissemination of
audiovisual works in Low German are also encouraged in this way.

7. Saxony-Anhalt
Pursuant to the Decision of 19-11-1991 adopted by the Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt
(Parliamentary Publication 1/24/908 B), the Land Government is obliged to promote, in
particular, the Low German language, together with its cultural traditions. The Directives on
the Allocation of Grants, inter alia for the cultivation and preservation of local/regional
customs, explicitly lay down that promotion of Low German - in the form of musical,
literary or language-related activities in the pre-school and extracurricular sectors, for
instance in clubs, workshops and self-organized groups - is eligible for allocation of funds.
On the basis of these Directives, natural persons and associations can receive Land funding
to a maximum amount of 70 per cent of the expenses eligible for allocation of funds. Within
the frame work of such Land funding, it is also possible to grant subsidies for the production
of visual or audiovisual media in the Low German language. The production and
dissemination of audiovisual works in Low German are also encouraged in this way.
8. Schleswig- Holstein
This provision is implemented in Schleswig-Holstein in the following way:
The programming principles embodied in the Land Broadcasting Act provide an indirect
incentive to public service broadcasting and to private broadcasting: the Act lays down that
(...) the broadcasting programmes shall contribute (...) to the protection and promotion of
(linguistic) minorities. The programming principles provide for the production of
audiovisual works in the minority/regional languages, e.g. "Talk op Platt" ["Talk in Low
German"].
The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide
financial support to non-profit organizations with cultural aims, especially in the audiovisual
sector. Additional support is provided by the Gesellschaft zur Förderung audiovisueller
Werke in Schleswig-Holstein mbH (MSH - Limited Liability Company for the Promotion of
Audiovisual Works in Schleswig-Holstein). MSH obtains funds from the NDR broadcasting
corporation and from ULR [the Schleswig- Holstein supervisory authority for private
broadcasters]. These funds are used for the promotion of commissioned productions and
coproductions in the cinema sector, television and sound broadcasting, which are made by
producers who are native to, or resid ent in, Schleswig-Holstein.
Legal Bases:
Land Broadcasting Act (of 13 October 1999): Section 24, para. 3; Section 53, para. 2; Section 73, para. 2.
Otherwise, it is left to the (linguistic) minorities, on the basis of the cultural promotion by
the Land and of the principle of self- government, to decide on pertinent measures and to
implement these within the limits of the overall funds available.

211

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) ii - Newspaper Articles –
(ii)
to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper
articles in the regional or minority languages on a regular basis;
1. Brandenburg
On account of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the Constitution, there is little scope
for the Land directly to influence the design/organization of printed media. However, the
Land Government takes a favourable view of the publication of articles in the Low German
language. Low German articles actually appear quite frequently in the printed media of the
Low German speech and cultural area.
The most important daily newspapers of the region are "Uckermark -Kurier" * , "Oranienburger Generalanzeiger" * and "Der Prignitzer".
The newspaper "Der Prignitzer" which is read in the North Western region of the Land at
regular intervals prints articles in the Low German language. These are, in particular,
articles on regional history, nature study, and local history and geography, and literary
items. In addition, there is reporting, also in standard German, on the work of clubs
dedicated to the preservation of local and regional traditions and of similar associations
devoted, inter alia, to the cultivation of the Low German language and culture, so as to
familiarize also non-speakers of the Low German language with the work of such clubs and
associations.
Every two weeks, the newspaper "Uckermark -Kurier" which is read in the North Eastern
region of the Land publishes one page with Low German items. For the major part, these are
stories written by contemporary authors from the region, but the works of authors from
earlier epochs are included as well. There are also reports on the impact of Low German.
Oranienburger Generalanzeiger does not regularly print items in the Low German
language.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Publication of the monthly INS PRESSE by the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache e.V.
(INS - Institute for the Low German Language) for the information of the regional and
supraregional media on Low German matters.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Low German articles appear every day in the daily evening paper "Hamburger Abendblatt"
(cf. no. 7 below, information provided by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein) and regularly in
various weeklies of the city districts (e.g. in the weekly "Niendorfer Wochenblatt" ) and in
relevant information bulletins.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania

*

Kurier = Courier; Messenger; Post - Generalanzeiger = Gazette

212

Both in towns and rural areas, dailies, advertising papers and Sunday papers play an important role in the dissemination of Low German texts. About once per week, the newspapers of the Land publish Low German texts which are very popular with the reading public. As a rule, Low German texts (e.g. stories, poems, "Läuschen un Rimels" [the title of
droll stories by Fritz Reuter], features) appear in the local/regional section or the feature
supplement [feuilleton]. The "Mecklenburg-Magazin" of Schweriner Volkszeitung also
assigns a regular section to Low German. The "Mecklenburg-Magazin" is published once
per week. Also, the local/regional sections of newspapers often publish articles on Low
German stage performances and events/meetings organized by Low German clubs and
authors.
The use of Low German as an occasional 'language of politics' is also reflected in the
newspapers when these publish entire articles in Low German or often chose a Low German
headline which, for instances, might be quoted from a speech.
The wide-spread popularity of Low German is demonstrated by Low German personal
(birth, marriage, death) announcements or personal congratulations. Occasionally, readers
also draft their letters to the editor in Low German.
Business and industry, too, have discovered the Low German language as a means having
great publicity appeal. A number of advertisements - of special events or specialties of the
Land - contain Low German texts.
5. Lower Saxony
On account of the freedom of the press as guarantueed by the Constitution, there is, on
principle, no scope for direct [state] action/influence. Moreover, it is not possible, with a
view to competitiveness, to impose binding requirements on publishing houses.
Also the supraregional newspapers, but especially the regional and local papers carry many
and various articles in the Low German language, in part as regular columns.
On appropriate occasions, the Land Government repeatedly makes appeals to include and
present the Low German language also in press publications. This appeal is addressed both
directly to the publishing houses and through the Verband Nordwestdeutscher Zeitungsverleger [Association of North West German Newspaper Publishers].
6. Saxony-Anhalt
Both in towns and rural areas, the regional daily press plays an important role in the
dissemination of Low German texts. Every week, the weekend edition of the "Volksstimme"
["People's Voice"] , for its entire circulation area, runs at least one page entitled "PLATT
SPRÄKEN" ["Speaking Low German"] covering various Low German texts. In addition,
Low German texts (e.g. short stories, legends, poems, songs, recipes, features) can be found
in the local/regional section or in the feature section of both the "Volksstimme" and other
local or regional newspapers.
7. Schleswig- Holstein

213

There is little scope for Land action/influence on account of the freedom of the press
guaranteed by the Constitution (in this respect, cf. the comments above in Part C on Article
11 [pp. 46 seqq.]).
However, the Verband der Zeitungsverlage Norddeutschland e.V. [Association of
Newspaper Publishers for Northern Germany] takes the protection of minorities and of
linguistic groups very seriously. As a result, and on account of requests to this effect by
readers, reports in the Low German language have become an integral part of newspapers in
Schleswig- Holstein.
In addition, the Minister-President of Schleswig- Holstein Land , in a letter of 29 September
1999 addressed, inter alia, to the Zeitungsverlegerverband Schleswig-Holstein e.V.
[Schleswig-Holstein Association of Newspaper Publishers, reg'd], has encouraged
newspaper publishers to integrate "linguistic particularities which are among the features
determining the specificity of our Land" in their publications; intensification of first action
already taken in this respect would be welcomed by her.
The press share of Low German is as follows:
Hamburger Abendblatt (Hamburg Evening Paper; 248,430 copies), weekly Low German
section in the main edition, a 2-column article on Saturdays (100-120 characters)
Uetersener Nachrichten (Uetersen News; 5,848 copies), a "Low German Corner" every
Saturday
Pinneberger Tageblatt (Pinneberg Newspaper; 16,850 copies), every Sunday about one
quarter of a page
Elmshorner Nachrichten (Elmshorn News; 12,222 copies), occasionally Low German
items
Barmstedter Zeitung (Barmstedt Newspaper; 2,053 copies), a Low German column about
every two weeks (irregularly)
Lübecker Nachrichten (Lübeck News; 114,124 copies), once per week a Low German
column (60-80 lines); three times per month "Platt lesen" ["Reading Low German"]
(100 lines)
Dithmarscher Landeszeitung (Newspaper of Dithmarscher Land; 26,197 copies), about
5,800 lines/year
sh:z (Schleswig- Holstein Paper; 165,983 copies), a daily "Extrablatt" [extra page;
supplement], once per week "Maandagmorrn" ["Monday mornings"], and irregularly
items in the sh:z-magazin.
Schleswiger Nachrichten (Schleswig news; 15,892 copies), about once per month "Brev up
Barup"
Schlei-Bote (Schlei Herald; 4,445 copies), about once per month "Brev up Barup"
Kieler Nachrichten (Kiel News; 113,083 copies), irregularly one page (about 12 pages per
year)

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) ii - Financial Assistance for Audiovisual Productions –
(ii)
to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to
audiovisual productions in the regional or minority languages;
1. Brandenburg

214

The existing measures for financial assistance for audiovisual productions are not confined
to works in the German language. Works in Low German are also eligible for such
assistance.
It is planned to issue film promotion directives. These are now in the approval and
certification stage. Subsidizing of Low German productions will not be curtailed under these
directions.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
'Open Channel' (radio and television) productions are granted subsidies.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
Tape-recordings and videograms of readings by authors and of stage productions in the Low
German language are on sale.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
The making and funding of audiovisual productions in the regional language Low German
can be applied for within the framework of project-oriented promotion. The basis for such
applications is the cultural promotion directive. One example of successful video
productions is the video "Norddeutsche Märchen und Sagen" ["North German Folk Tales
and Legends"] produced by Hagenow Kreis Adult Education Centre, which is used in Low
German classroom instruction.
5. Lower Saxony
In this respect, reference is made to the comments above on sub-para. (d) - "5. Lower
Saxony".
6. Schleswig- Holstein
Direct financial assistance by the State is problematic, due to the freedom of broadcasting
guaranteed by the Constitution. However, the following promotional/subsidizing
possibilities exist:
The Unabhängige Landesanstalt für das Rundfunkwesen (ULR) is entitled to provide
financial support to non-profit organizations with cultural (...) aims, especially in the
audiovisua l sector (...).
Additional support is provided by the Gesellschaft zur Förderung audiovisueller Werke in
Schleswig-Holstein mbH (MSH - Limited Liability Company for the Promotion of
Audiovisual Works in Schleswig-Holstein). MSH obtains funds from the NDR broadcasting
corporation and from ULR [the Schleswig- Holstein supervisory authority for private
broadcasters]. These funds are used for the promotion of commissioned productions and
coproductions in the cinema sector, television and sound broadcasting, which are made by
producers who are native to, or resident in, Schleswig-Holstein.

215

re: Art. 11, para. 2 - Freedom of Direct Reception of Broadcasts, and Freedom of
Expression –
(2)
The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language
used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and
not to oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from
neighbouring countries in such a language. They further undertake to
ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language. The exercise
of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it carries with it duties and
responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions
or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic
society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public
safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health
or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
Free reception of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries is guaranteed
by the Basic Law throughout the Federal Republic of Germany. In this regard, cf. the
detailed comments in Part C on Article 11 [pp. 46 seq. above].
In addition, this obligation has once more been explicitly adopted by the Land of Brandenburg, the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg and the
Länder of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia,
Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig- Holstein; this acceptance did not entail the need for any
special implementation measures.

Article 12
Cultural Activities and Facilities
(1)
With regard to cultural activities and facilities - especially libraries,
video libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres
and cinemas, as well as literary work and film production, vernacular
forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture industries, including
inter alia the use of new technologies - the Parties undertake, within the
territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
re: para. 1, sub-para. (a) - Types of Expression, and Access to Works in the Languages (a)

to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works
produced in these languages;

The Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German Language),
with headquarters in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, plays a prominent role as regards

216

cultivation of the Low German language and implementation of the accepted undertakings.
The Institute is subsidized by the Länder of Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony, North
Rhine/ Westphalia and Schleswig- Holstein under an Agreement concluded to this effect.
The Institute for the Low German Language in Bremen is highly esteemed by the academic
community as well as by writers, the theatre, choral societies, etc. The activities of the INS
refer to the entire Low German speech area, have explicitly been put on a cross-State,
supraregional basis, and essentially are oriented towards all aspects of Low German language culture. A major research focus is on the facts and issues related to the social functions of regional languages in modern times. The findings and research results are passed on
by the INS to the interested public. Recently, the INS placed its site on the Internet and can
be contacted by e-mail so that many items of information can be obtained decentrally.
The INS publishes, inter alia, the "Plattdeutsch-Hochdeutsches Wörterbuch" ["Low
German/ Standard German Dictionary"] and the "Hochdeutsch-Plattdeutsches Wörterbuch"
["Standard German/Low German Dictionary"]. In addition, it has developed a
comprehensive exhibition on Low German. Its library comprises some 14,000 media units.
Section 2, "Purpose", of the Statute of the providing body (sponsoring Association)
describes the Institute's terms of reference as follows:
"The Institute shall be organized as an academic/scholarly centre and shall fulfil the
following tasks:
e) collection, classification and scientific analysis of works in the Low German
language, with particular reference to the present time;
f) editing the work results for the general public;
g) co-ordination of, and support for, all efforts aimed at cultivating and preserving
the Low German language;
h) maintenance and development of links with similar institutions, also abroad.
In this way, the Association promotes scientific/scholarly objectives. Thus, it is of
service, at the same time, to education in general and to popular education, and to
international understanding. It exclusively and directly pursues nonprofit/publicbenefit and scientific purposes."
1. Brandenburg
Promotion of Low German culture is project-oriented, within the framework of the Land's
general cultural promotion. For instance, a number of printing-cost subsidies were granted
for publications in the Low German language or for objects of the North German culture.
Also, other literary projects or other forms of cultural expression will, upon application, be
subsidized within the limits of the available resources; Low German is not placed at a
disadvantage in relation to works in the standard German language.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In Bremen, access to works in the Low German language is ensured through the promotion
and maintenance of the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS) which has adequate stocks
of literature at its disposal. Also, a large number of works are held by the archives and
libraries in Bremen. In addition, the adult education centres offer literature courses which
make it possible for all sections of the population to have access to works in the Low
German language.

217

3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
In Hamburg, this obligation is implemented through financial support provided to the INS
[Institute for the Low German Language] and to the Hamburg Ohnsorg-Theater. Due
account is taken of the applications by various institutions for funding of Low German
activities (e.g. Quickborn-Vereinigung, Fehrsgilde).
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
It is with great commitment, in the context of voluntary activities, that the people of the
Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania use and cultivate the regional language Low
German as "their" language. Numerous associations, literary societies, libraries, the music
sector, the theatre and the literature sector pursue regional and supraregional activities
which include many and various possibilities for active encounters with the Low German
language and culture.
4.1 The Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Folk
Culture Institute of the Kulturbund, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania] in Rostock
devotes its efforts to the preservation and cultivation of the Low German language in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. In particular, the Folk Culture Institute directs its
efforts to fostering the learning and use of Low German by children and youngsters
and in teacher follow-up training. With a library comprising 2000 Low German or
region-specific books, brochures, journals and stage plays, the Folk Culture Institute is
an important source of information for all persons and groups interested in the Low
German language. Also, (phonograph) records, sound recordings and other media are
available, which contain regional music and songs as well as items dealing with folk
culture, cus toms and traditions, and regional cultural events. A documentation on
bibliographic data on Low German authors can also be consulted at the Folk Culture
Institute.
The current Low German projects of the Volkskulturinstitut include its participation together with the Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V.
[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions], the
Landesinstitut für Schule und Ausbildung (L.I.S.A. - Land Institute for Schools and
Training) and the savings banks of the Land - in the Land-wide Low German
competition "Kinner, wi snacken platt!" ["Children, we're talking in Low German"].
The Volkskulturinstitut regularly organizes follow-up training for Low German
teachers and other interested persons. The programme also includes the Rostocker
Plattdeutsch-Tag [Rostock Low German Day] which is prepared and organized in cooperation with the representatives of the Low German groups and the Adult Education
Centre of the Hanseatic city of Rostock.
The work with, and support of, Low German authors are ensured by regular workshops
organized in collaboration with the Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenha gen. The
workshops of Low German authors form the basis of the publication "kikut" ["look
out"].

218

Another event included in the work programme is the Low German song festival "Nu
kaamt to hoop" [song title "Come now in large numbers"] in Güstrow. The aim of the
song festival is to show the beauty and diversity of the regional song heritage and
present new Low German songs.
Another association which is also dedicated to Low German is the Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land
Union for Local and Regional Traditions]; this is a recognized Land association for
cultural affairs and the preservation of regional traditions in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania which, since 1991, has made a significant contribution to the preservation
and fostering of the Low German language in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
In this context, the Landesheimatverband has, inter alia, established a Fachgruppe
"Niederdeutsch" ["Low German" Subject-Matter Group] which significantly caters for
the great communication needs of the Low German clubs/associations, friends of the
Low German language, etc., also in relation to the general public and in the educational
sector. The Fachgruppe "Niederdeutsch" holds several meetings per year to help with
the preparation of regional and Land-wide events organized by the Landesheimatverband (Low German Competition, and expert meetings). In addition to representatives
of the Landesheimatverband and the co-organizers of the Low German Competition,
membership of the Fachgruppe includes the two university professors for Low
German.
In addition to close contacts with the Schleswig-Holsteinische Heimatbund (SHHB Schleswig- Holstein Union for Local and Regional Traditions), the Niedersächsischer
Heimatbund (NHB - Lower Saxony Union for Local and Regional Traditions), the
Heimatbund für Niederdeutsche Kultur des Oldenburger Landes [Local/Regional
Traditions Association for Low German Culture of the Oldenburger Land] and with
citizens' groups, these activities include membership of the Landesheimatverband and
participation in the latter's work by institutions such as the Amateurtheaterverband SH
[Schleswig-Holstein Association of Amateur Theatrical Societies], the
Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund [Union of Low German Theatres], the Bund
Niederdeutscher Autoren [Union of Low German Authors] and other associations
devoted to the cultivation of the Low German language.
The interests of Low German have, already since 1993, been safeguarded by a [female]
representative of the Landesheimatverband to the NDR-Rundfunkrat [Broadcasting
Board of Norddeutscher Rundfunk] (including the Landesrundfunkrat [Land
Broadcasting Board]). Thus, the Landesheimatverband at the same time represents the
interests of the North German Land Unions for Local/Regional Traditions on the
Broadcasting Board.
In addition to having prepared and organized the Land-wide Low German Competitions "Wi snacken Platt" ["We're talking in Low German"], the Landesheimatverband in co-operation with its co-organizers (Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und
Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Folk Culture Institute of the Kulturbund,
Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania], the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land
Institute for Schools and Training (L.I.S.A.), and the savings banks of the Land with
their partners) - has significantly contributed to the promotion of the Lo w German
language in children's day-care centres, schools and recreational facilities.

219

The Land-wide Low German Competition has since 1992/1993 been organized every
two years. This includes the organization of regional competitions in various places of
the Land and, as the conclusion and highlight, the Land competition of the respective
year.
Since 1994, the study of Low German texts, treatment of the subject 'schools and Low
German', issues concerning Low German in the media, and the appreciation of
language researchers and folklorists have been a permanent element of the expert
meetings and events which are held at least twice a year.
In addition to preparing and organizing the Low German Competitions and expert
meetings, other traditional and topical projects are part of the self-defined mandate of
the Landesheimatverband:
Since 1995, the Reuter Festival in Fritz Reuter's native town of Stavenhagen,
under a motto chosen for each year, has been organized in co-operation with the
town of Stave nhagen and the Stavenhagen Culture and Local Traditions Club.
These Reuter Festivals are not only one of the highlights of the activities for the
preservation and cultivation of Low German but, at the same time, also provide a
forum and stage for Low German clubs/associations, authors, individuals and
choirs. The NDR broadcasting station has been a media partner in the context of
this Festival for many years already.
As part of the yearly Land Cultural Days, two events have, already since 1994,
been a regular item on the events schedule of the Landesheimatverband:
 meeting of Low German associations and groups (exchange of experience), and
 Landeschortreffen, a Land-wide meeting of choirs specializing in Low German
works.
Readings by authors, and the presentation of new young authors in the regions of
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
Every five years (for the first time in 1995 in Stavenhagen), organization of
"Norddeutsche Werkstatttage niederdeutscher Autoren" ["North German
Workshops of Low German Authors"].
Since 1995, in co-operation with the Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenhagen, call for nominations for "Plattdeutsches Wort des Jahres" ["Low German
Word of the Year"].
In 1998, events on the subject of "Niederdeutsch in den Landkreisen mit Kitas,
Schulen und Volkshochschulen - Singen, Lesen und Spielen" ["Low German in the
Landkreise with children's day-care centres, schools and adult education centres Singing, Reading and Playing"] were initiated as pilot projects (inter alia, in the
Landkreise of Ludwigslust and Uecker-Randow; planned to be organized in
Parchim Landkreis).
Co-operation, on a continuing basis, with schools, associations, institutions and
the two universities of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Greifswald and
Rostock. A regular feature are the temporary offices in the various Landkreise,
which are available as partners or consultation agencies also for Low German and
folklore.
Publication of reading materials and sound recordings for the Low German
Competition, and other Low German publications and work materials such as
Niederdeutsche Leseblätter [Low German Reading Papers] (1992),
Plattdüütsches Snückerbauk [Low German Browsing Book] (1994), Plattdeutsche
Wechselverse [Low German Couplets] as a painting book (1994), Niederdeutsche

220

-

Kinderlieder [Low German Nur sery Rhymes] recorded on an MC, Plattdütsch för
grote un lütte Kinner [Low German for Children Big and Small] (1998/1999).
The quarterly series published by the Landesheimatverband and entitled
"Heimathefte f ür Mecklenburg und Vorpommern" ["Booklets on Local History
and Geography for Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania"] covers the Low
German language in addition to articles on culture, history, nature and the
environment. Since 1991, more than 500 articles, poems and short stories have
been published in this series. This amounts to about 25 % of the contents of one
issue. More than 1000 items regarding, or on, our Low German language are held
in the archives of the editorial department.

The Kulturbund Landesverband Mecklenburg und Vorpommern e.V. also works for
the preservation and cultivation of the Low German language and literature. Twentytwo groups, with more than 500 members, cultivate Low German through readings,
programmes and the writing of texts. In addition, the Kulturbund gives co-operative
support to the Low German Competition "Wi snacken platt" ["We're speaking Low
German"]. Since 1991, the Kulturbund has published the journal "Stier und Greif"
["Bull and Griffin"]. This scholarly publication regularly publishes items on Low
German.
One of the declared objectives of the foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg in Ratzeburg is
to foster the Low German culture and to strengthen the cultural infrastructure, especially in the communities, towns/cities and Keise of the two Länder concerned
[Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]. The current Low German
projects of Stiftung Mecklenburg concern the development of a Low German school
reader for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania - i.e. a 3-volume school reader to be used
for all grades (lower and upper secondary grades) in Schleswig-Holstein and
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The project is developed in close co-operation with
the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German Language)
in Bremen. The involvement of the two Länder in this schoolbook project is clear
evidence of the communality of the Low German cultural heritage in the North
German region.
The Zentrum für Niederdeutsch [Centre for Low German], established at the
foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg in Haus Mecklenburg in Ratzeburg, has the task to
cultivate the Low German language and culture in the Holstein region of the Land and
also to foster co-operation with Mecklenburg.
Work priorities are:
provision of information on the Low German language, literature and culture;
documentation on Low German activities in the region;
school-based promotion: the Low German activities of schools and adult
education centres are promoted by the Centre for Low German;
supraregional co-operation: there are regular exchanges with institutions in other
regions/Länder - for instance with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania - so as to
ensure co-ordinated efforts in promoting Low German.
4.2 The following examples of initiatives in the field of linguistic and cultural activities are
supported by the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the basis of the Cultural
Promotion Direcive:

221

4.2.1 Clubs/associations and institutes
Verein für niederdeutsche Sprachforschung e.V. (Association for Low German
Language Research, reg'd):
The objective of the Association for Low German Language Research, which was
founded in 1874, is "to research and study the Low German language and its
literature in the past and modern times". Priority is expressly given to research.
The aims of the Association are achieved, in particular, by:
- publication of a yearbook and a correspondence bulletin;
- publication of older manuscripts and prints;
- publication of research and other papers on the various subjects covered;
- organization of annual meetings of the Association's members, with public
lectures;
- activities in local groups.
Examples of comprehensive publications referring to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are, inter alia, the essay by Jürgen Gundlach on the Mecklenburgisches Wörterbuch [Mecklenburg Dictionary], or the publication by Renate Herrmann-Winter on
the subject of "Sprachen und Sprechen in Pommern" ["Languages and Speech in
Pomerania"]. The Pentecost meeting of the Verein für niederdeutsche
Sprachforschung was held in the Hanseatic town of Wismar in 1997. The 2000
Pentecost meeting is planned to take place in the Hanseatic town of Greifswald.
Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache e.V. (INS - Institute for the Low German
Language) in Bremen:
Close working contacts are maintained with the Institute for the Low German
Language.
The Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has not yet acceded to the joint
Administrative Agreement of 1979 on the Funding of the Institute (cf. the general introductory remarks in the comments on Article 12, para. 1, sub-para. (a) [pp. 194
above]). So far, the tight financial situation in the 'new Länder' * has precluded
cofunding of the INS. However, the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has
offered the Ins titute to subsidize projects carried out in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania. An example is the series of public lectures on "Niederdeutsch in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 1933 bis 1945" ["Low German in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania, 1933 - 1945"], which took place in Schwerin in 1995 on the occasion of
the millenary "1000 Jahre Mecklenburg". The topic of that meeting was the
approach to the cultivation of Low German in Mecklenburg and Pomerania during
the Third Reich.
4.2.2 Literary Societies
Two literary societies and a literature museum are devoted to the cultivation of the
heritage of the classical epoch of new Low German literature which is represented,
in particular, by the authors John Brinckman and Fritz Reuter.
*

i.e. those of the former East German GDR [Translator's Note]

222

John-Brinckman-Gesellschaft e.V. (John Brinckman Society):
The declared aim of the John Brinckman Society which was founded in 1990 is to
"bring together the friends of Brinckman in order to share in the re-discovery of the
poet's life and work and to make them accessible to the general public." Also, one of
the tasks of the John Brinckman Society is to maintain and preserve the heritage of
standard German and Low German works. The priority aim of the John Brinckman
Society is to cultivate the Low German language.
Together with the publishing house Hinstorff-Verlag Rostock, the John Brinckman
Society in the autumn of 1993 published a jubilee edition on the occasion of the
125th anniversary of the complete edition of "Kasper-Ohm un ick" ["Uncle Kasper
and I"]. In 1995, a reader entitled "John Brinckman - ein Lesebuch" was published.
Fritz-Reuter-Gesellschaft e.V. (Fritz Reuter Society):
The Fritz Reuter Society was founded in Lübeck on 15 July 1960 to mark the 150th
anniversary of Fritz Reuter's birthday and, in 1991, moved its headquarters to the
town of Neubrandenburg. The Fritz Reuter Society fulfils its mandate by organizing
evening lectures and recitals and by the publication of fiction and scholarly works.
Every year, Fritz Reuter Days are organized by the Fritz Reuter Society in varying
places. These Reuter-Tage are important centres of innovation and transformation of
Reuter research. The Fritz Reuter Society has published bulletins since 1966 and
articles (prints of presentations given at the Reuter-Tage) since 1989, and promotes
and supports the publication and dissemination of Low German literature. In
addition, regular monthly events, with Low German recitals and presentations, have
been organized since 1997 at Neues Tor in the town of Neubrandenburg. Also (since
1981), the Society awards the "Ehrenbrief [Scroll of Honour] der FritzReuterGesellschaft" to honour persons, literary societies or institutes who/which
have made substantial contributions to the dissemination of Fritz Reuter's works
and/or to the preservation and cultivation of the Low German language.
Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum (Fritz Reuter Literature Museum):
The Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum in Stavenhagen was founded in 1960. It collects
all materials which, generally and specifically, provide information on Fritz Reuter's
life and work and on the recension of his works. In addition, objects are on display
which serve to illustrate Fritz Reuter's life and work and to enrich the permanent
exhibition on this subject. The Fritz Reuter Literature Museum also has a museum
library (some 13,000 volumes) and extensive achives of articles and pictures. The
permanent exhibition is complemented by special exhibitions on specific Low
German topics. Also, the Fritz-Reuter-Museum at regular intervals holds the
"Plattdütscher Stammtisch" ["Low German Discussion Group Meetings"], which
make it possible for people interested in Low German to meet, and talk to, regional
and local politicians.
The Fritz-Reuter-Literaturmuseum also organizes a children's event entitled "Unkel
Hers', wat seggst du?" ["What do you say, Uncle Hers'?"], which is aimed at

223

initiating children of grades 1 to 4, in the form of play and entertainment, into
reading and speaking Low German texts, understanding stories or visiting museums.
The Fritz Reuter Literature Museum has a major share in the organization of the
Reuter Festival. This event is organized once per year in Reuter's native town of
Stavenhagen.
As a public relations activity for the Low German language, and at the initiative of
the Fritz Reuter Literatur e Museum, the Fachgruppe Niederdeutsch [Subject-Matter
Group "Low German"] of the Landesheimatverband Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V.
[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions,
reg'd] issues an annual public call for the nomination of the year's Low German word
in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
Johannes Gillhoff Gesellschaft e.V. (Johannes Gillhoff Society):
The Johannes Gillhoff Society was founded in Glaisin, where it has its headquarters,
in 1993. The Society's tasks are the preservation and dissemination of Johannes
Gillhoff's works, research on the migration history of, and the contacts maintained
with, the descendants of U.S. immigrants from Mecklenburg, youth work, and the
organization of cultural events in the Griesen area. In Glaisin, the Johannes Gillhoff
Society maintains the Gillhoff Archives, a memorial museum regarding the life,
work and impact of this author and the migration history, and organizes monthly
Low German readings in Glaisin. During the Gillhoff-Tage which have been held
every year since 1993, the Kulturkreis Mecklenburg with headquarters in Hamburg
awards the Johannes-Gillhoff-Preis für niederdeutsche Literatur und Publizistik
[Johannes Gillhoff Award für Low German Literature and Journalism] which was
instituted in 1980.
Bund Niederdeutscher Autoren e.V. (Low German Writers' Union, reg'd):
The Low Germans Writers' Union was founded in Neubrandenburg in 1990, with
headqua rters in Verchen. The tasks of the Bund Niederdeutscher Autoren e.V. are the
preservation and cultivation of the Low German language and the promotion of Low
German writers.
4.2.3 Publishing Houses
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, there are a number of publishing houses
dedicated to the promotion of Low German literature. Ranking prominently among
these is Hinstorff Verlag GmbH Rostock. The Low German section of the
publication programme of this publishing house which can look back on a rich
tradition not only features authors like Fritz Reuter but also writers such as Richard
Wossidlo, John Brinckman, Rudolf Tarnow, Joha nnes Gillhoff and other Low
German authors. In addition, this publishing house, which in 1990 was transformed
into a limited liability company, promotes contemporary authors using the Low
German language.
The publishing house Hinstorff-Verlag GmbH regularly publishes Low German
books. As a rule, both the spring and the autumn programmes cover two Low
German titles each.

224

Quite a few publishing houses of more recent date, i.e. founded after 1990, also
direct their efforts to the Low German language. This is done in the form of fiction/
poetry and increasingly by means of publications intended to promote learning of the
Low German language.

225

4.2.4 Libraries
Science libraries:
Since the beginning of the 20th Century, the Rostock University Library has been
collecting Low German literature of Mecklenburg. It holds some 3,320 titles which
cover the Unive rsity's entire spectrum of subjects and, dating back as far as the 18th
Century, mainly deal with topics of divinity, law, natural sciences and history.
Holdings of more recent date are exclusively literary works.
The Rostock University Library has some 55 Low German manuscript, deeds and
fragments, half of which date back to the Middle Ages, on subjects of divinity, law,
medicine and history.
The library of the Germanistisches Institut holds some 500 literary works in the Low
German language.
With about 10,000 volumes, the Fachbibliothek Volkskunde [Special Library for
Folklore (study of the material culture and customs)] of the Rostock University
Library in the Institut für Volkskunde (Wossidlo-Archiv) [Institute for the Study of
the Material Culture and Customs (Wossidlo Archives)] constitutes the Land's
largest specialist library on folklore and cultural history. Its basic stock is formed by
Richard Wossidlo's library for scholarly research. Some 400 volumes of the
reference library are Low German source texts or linguistic works, including rare
dialect dictionaries.
The university library of Ernst Moritz Arndt University in Greifswald holds some
5,000 Low German volumes. The main subject areas are:
- linguistics and study of literature;
- Low German fiction and poetry;
- study of the material culture and customs.
In addition, the Institut für Deutsche Philologie [Institute for German/Germanic
Philology], with its Chair of Low German Language and Literature, has its own
study library.
Public libraries:
The overall holdings of literature in the Low German language at the MecklenburgWestern Pomerania Land Library in Schwerin are estimated to comprise 2,500 titles.
For the major part, these are works of fiction and poetry (belles- lettres). Various
works deal with subjects of history, theology and linguistics.
The Low German literature is one of the collection priorities of the Regional Library
in Neubrandenburg. Among the tasks of the Special Collection on Regional History
and Geography are archiving of, and providing access to, vernacular literature as an
element of the cultural/historical heritage. This Special Collection comprises some
16,000 volumes (i.e. about 20,000 books) on the history, general and political
geography, the customs and traditions, and cultural history of Mecklenburg.

226

4.2.5 Music
The Low German song heritage in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is preserved
and cultivated through the work of local/regional cultural clubs and associations, at
schools and adult education centres and through many and various events.
For the Mecklenburg region of the Land, the valuable archives of Mecklenburg folk
songs, kept at the Institut für Volkskunde [Institute for the Study of the Material
Culture and Customs], cover several hundreds of song recordings. Another 5,000
song texts are held in the Wossidlo Archives.
For Pomerania, the Volkskundliches Archiv Pommern [Pomerian Folklore Archives]
was established in Greifswald in 1929; it owned, inter alia, 15,000 recordings of folk
songs and dances. Remaining parts of the collection of folk songs and dances are
kept at the Low German Department of Ernst Moritz Arndt University.
Already in the 1920s and 1930s, a duplicate of the collections of folk songs and
dances of Pomerania, of which only parts have been preserved in Greifswald, was
given to the German Folk Song Archives in Freiburg so that Pomerania's song and
dance traditions continue to be accessible.
The Low German folk song tradition was significantly promoted by the publication,
in 1981, of the songbook by Heike Müns. The Low German song festival "Nu kaamt
to hoop" [song title "Come now in large numbers"] and the Low German programme
"Uns Küst - uns Hüsung" ["Our Coast - Our Homeland"] reflect the broad range and
diversity of Low German and of regional songs and dances. Performances are given
by choirs, musicians, dancers, shanty and folklore singers and many singer-songwriters.
4.2.6 Theatres
Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. (MecklenburgWestern Pomerania Union of Low German Theatres)
The main members of the Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,
which was founded in 1991, are: Niederdeutsche Bühne in Rostock e.V. [Low
German Theatre in Rostock], "Plattdütsch Späldäl" to Stralsund e.V. [Low German
Drama Club of Stralsund], Niederdeutsche Bühne [Low German Theatre] Wismar
e.V., Niederdeutsche Bühne der Stadt Neubrandenburg e.V., "Schönberger Späldäl
e.V." [Drama Club of Schönberg] and Niederdeutsche Bühne Grevesmühlen e.V. The
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Union of Low German Theatres helps its affiliated
theatres with all aspects of Low German stage play.
Since autumn 1989 [peaceful revolution in East Germany], the Niederdeutscher
Bühnenbund Mecklenburg-Vorpommern e.V. has organized two 'Theatre Days' and
has become a well-known and high-profile institution for the Low German language
and the Low German theatre. The Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Union of Low
German Theatres and its affiliated theatre companies with great devotion and
enthusiasm work for the fostering, preservation and cultivation of the traditions of
the Low German language.

227

Fritz-Reuter-Bühne Schwerin (Fritz Reuter Theatre, town of Schwerin)
The Fritz Reuter Theatre of Schwerin, which was founded in 1926 and which,
besides the Ohnsorg-Theater of Hamburg, is one of the most important Low German
theatres in the North German seaboard Länder, has its own cast. At present,
negotiations are underway regarding regular performances of the Fritz Reuter
Theatre in the programme of the TV station N 3. During its 1998/99 season, the Fritz
Reuter Theatre of Schwerin gave 154 performances and entertained 26,396
theatregoers with its Low German plays.
5. Lower Saxony
The Land of Lower Saxony generally takes a particular interest in promoting initiatives in
the cultural sphere, and especially with regard to the literature in the regional and the
minority languages. Literature and language play a central role in the identification of the
individual and of the community. Thus, the notion of 'language' must not be confined to the
standard language; rather, it also includes regional languages such as Low German or the
languages of the other ethnic groups residing here. On this basis, Low German literature can
be included in all areas of the promotion of literature (promotion of production, distribution
and reception) in the Land of Lower Saxony. In 1983, the East Frisian author Oswald
Andrae was awarded the Lower Saxony artists' grant "Künstlerstipendium des Landes
Niedersachsen" for his Low German poetry. Promotion of writings as well as the
publication of literary works by Low German publishing houses are evaluated by an expert
jury proficient in the Low German language. However, the literary quality of the submitted
works not all too often meets the criteria applied by the jury.
Many clubs, societies and associations - which in instances are also granted Land subsidies pursue various activities, also in public, for the cultivation and preservation of Low German.
Among these are the Low German theatres which have been established in many places of
this region.
The Ministry for Scientific and Cultural Affairs encourages events regarding the subject of
Low German and organized by Land-subsidized institutions such as the Literaturrat
[Literature Council] or the Literaturbüros [Literature Offices]. Thus, for instance, several
Low German readings were held in the course of the Land-wide literature event
"Bücherfrühling" ["Spring of Books"]. Next year [2001], a meeting will be held to discuss
the ranking of the literature in the regional or minority languages.
Implementation of the undertakings entered into is also accomplished with the support of
the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German Language) in
Bremen (cf. the introductory remarks in our comments on Article 12, para. 1, sub-para. (a)
[p. 194 above]) and of the Land- funded libraries (cf. the comments above on Article 12,
para. 1, sub-para. (g)).
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
Responsibility for the cultivation of cultural traditions in North Rhine/Westphalia essentially
lies with the cities, towns, Kreise and Landschaftsverbände. Regarding Low German in
North Rhine/Westphalia, promotion in the cultural field is pursued, in particular, by the
Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe [regional local authority of Westfalen-Lippe]. This
Regional Authority has six Commissions for studies covering the history, geography and

228

political sys tem of a region, with the sole task of carrying out research on the history and
geography of Westphalia, publishing the findings, and holding conferences on their fields of
activity. One of the subjects covered is attended to by the Commission for "Dialectology
and Names Research [Onomastics, Toponymy] of Westphalia", covering research on the
Westphalian language history, especially archiving of Low German word material, and
registration of the Westphalian dialects, local field names and proverbs. The Commission
publishes the journal "Niederdeutsches Wort. Beiträge zur niederdeutschen Philologie"
["The Low German Word. Articles on Low German Philology"] and two series,
"Norddeutsche Studien" ["Low German Studies"] and "Westfälische Beiträge zur
niederdeutschen Philologie" ["Westphalian Contributions to Low German Philology"].
Dedicated funds of the budget of the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe are employed for
the promotion of Low German writings and language cultivation. Part of these funds are
allocated to the Augustin-Wibbelt-Gesellschaft. The activities of this Low German literary
society are focused on the work of the Low German writer Augustin Wibbelt and on the
cultivation and promotion of, and research on, the Low German literature and language of
Westphalia. Inter alia, a yearbook and a new edition of Augustin Wibbelt's work are published by the Society.
The institutional promotion of the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (INS) in Bremen
helps - also within the meaning of Article 12, para. 1 - to encourage types of expression
specific to the regional language Low German and to foster means of access to works
produced in this regional language.
7. Saxony-Anhalt
Promotion of cultural activities regarding music, literature, language history and history/
geography is one of the sectors laid down in the Directives on the Allocation of Grants (in
this regard, reference is made to the comments on Article 11, para. 1, sub-para. (d) - "7.
Saxony-Anhalt").
A major part of the activities to cultivate and preserve the vernacular in Saxony-Anhalt is
looked after by committed individuals, assocations, societies and interest groups, the
declared aims of whom/which include the cultivation, fostering and preservation of Low
German in the sense of cultivating the linguistic milieu. The pertinent activities range from
scholarly research and documentation on the use of the language in everyday life, to Low
German working panels and Dialect Days which are also attended by large numbers of
children and youngsters from the various regions. In this regard, mention is to be made of
the annual expert conferences organized by the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V.
[Saxony-Anhalt Land Union for Local and Regional Traditions, reg'd] on specific Low
German subjects; a co-organizer is the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch [Workshop for Low
German] of the Germanistisches Institut of the Magdeburg Otto-von-Guericke-Universität.
The findings/conclusions of these expert conferences (subsidized with funds of the Ministry
of Education and Cultural Affairs) are published so that the interested individuals and
groups can then have access to them through universities, libraries, clubs/associations and
schools of the Land.
The Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch of the Germanistisches Institut of Otto von Guericke
University in Magdeburg was founded already in 1990 with the task of looking into and
dealing with matters regarding the use, acceptance and development of Low German in
Saxony-Anhalt. The focus is on sociolinguistic issues and also on aspects of language

229

cultivation and preservation; the results of this work are used, on the one hand, in teacher
training (cf. also the comments on Article 8, para. 1, sub-para. (h) [p. 170 above]) and, on
the other hand, form the basis of facultative course offers for persons interested in the
language. The efforts of the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch, aimed at the fostering,
dissemination and cultivation of Low German, include research on dialects and the
establishment of a reference library for vernacular literature.
Another research project regarding sociolinguistic studies on Low German in SaxonyAnhalt (sociolinguistic surveys in the Southern and Eastern regions) was carried out on the
basis of the project "Untersuchungen zum Niederdeutschen im Norden von Sachsen-Anhalt"
["Studies on the Low German Language in the North of Saxony-Anhalt"].
As part of its programme, the Sächsische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig [Saxon
Academy of Sciences of Leipzig] promotes the project "Mittelelbisches Wörterbuch"
["Dictionary for the Middle Elbe Region"]. This project covers the recording and analysis of
the vobabulary of the dialect spoken in the Middle Elbe region (Altmark, Börde, Harz
mountains, Jerichower Land, Anhalt) and the presentation and description of the phonetic
forms, distribution and meaning of words, including their origin and the respective subject
matter to which they refer. Implementation of the project is based on the material collected
in the period 1935-1958 under the direction, and with the personal commitment, of Karl
Bischoff. The "Mittelelbisches Wörterbuch" was subsidized by joint ? und/Länder funding
in the period 1992-1998. Since 1999, project-related subsidies have been allocated out of
research funds of the Land. The "Mittelelbisches Wörterbuch" project closely co-operates
with Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. The work of "Mittelelbisches
Wörterbuch" is intensively sup ported, in all aspects regarding the Low German language in
Saxony-Anhalt, by the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch of the Germanistisches Institut of Otto
von Guericke University of Magdeburg and by the experts for Low German and folklore
employed by the Landesheimatbund Saxony-Anhalt e.V. [Saxony-Anhalt Union for Local
and Regional Traditions].
As of the beginning of 1998, the Landesheimatbund Saxony-Anhalt e.V. established the post
of the head of a section for the cultivation of dialects/Low German, which is funded by the
Land as part of the institutional promotion of the Union. Under a co-operation agreement
with Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg, the [female] Head of Section was assigned to work with the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch and thus is directly involved in all
projects of academic relevance while the university research community can share the results of the direct practice-oriented activities in the cultural sector.
At present, a research project of several years' duration is being carried out by the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch, with the support of the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V., on the
subject of "Sprachsoziologische Untersuchungen zum Niederdeutschen in Sachsen-Anhalt"
["Sociolinguistic Studies on Low German in Saxony-Anhalt"]. First interim findings are
already available. Over a period of 16 years, an overall number of 5,197 persons were
interviewed in the Northern part of Saxony-Anhalt. Of these, 36.5 % have a very good
command of Low German. Low German is understood well or very well by 62.1 %.
Extrapolating from these figures with reference to the adult population of the
Regierungsbezirk [Land administrative unit] of Magdeburg, it can be assumed that at least
250,000 inhabitants speak Low German, and more than 500,000 understand Low German.
In addition to the aforementioned Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch, the Mittelelbisches Wörterbuch, and the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V., also the Arbeitskreis "Ostfälisches

230

Platt" e.V. [Working Panel on "Low German spoken in Ostfalen"] and the Ostfälisches
Kulturinstitut Ummendorf [Ostfalen Cultural Institute of Ummendorf] of the
Landschaftsverband "Deuregio" e.V. [regional local authority "Deuregio"], the work of
which is subsidized with project-related funds of the Land, are working on the identification
and support of activities for the cultivation of dialects and, in particular, the Low German
language.
Many scientific and popularized publications such as the "Schriftenreihe der Arbeitsstelle
Niederdeutsch"
["Publication
Series
of
the
Arbeitsstelle
Niederdeutsch"],
"Sprachsoziologische Untersuchungen zum Niederdeutschen in Sachsen-Anhalt"
["Sociolinguistic Studies on Low German in Saxony-Anhalt"], "Publikationen zur
Dialektsituation in Sachsen-Anhalt" ["Publications on the Situation regarding Dialects in
Saxony-Anhalt"] (a series published by the Landesheimatbund), "Zur Situation des
Norddeutschen zwischen Wittenberg und Salzwedel" ["On the Situation regarding the Low
German Language in the Region between Wittenberg and Salzwedel"] (in: "Festschrift für
[anniversary publication in hono ur of] Dieter Stellmacher zum 60. Geburtstag", Mannheim
1999) were subsidized by the Land.
Land funding is provided - usually within the framework of the preservation of local and
regional traditions - also for Low German publications.
In addition, Low German articles are regularly published in the "Sachsen-Anhalt-Journal"
of the Landheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt, and - to a lesser extent - literary texts appear in the
literary journal of Saxony-Anhalt "Ort der Augen" ["Where Eyes Dwell"].
In the towns and villages of the Low German speech area in Saxony-Anhalt, there are many
groups dedicated to the cultivation of dialects, which are among the registered clubs
working for the preservation of local traditions or similar associations. The efforts of such
groups are mainly directed at publicizing the vernacular authors of the region, at
establishing activity groups in schools, and at activities, addressed to all generations, for the
cultivation and preservation of the vernacular. In addition, with funds provided by the Land,
scholarly conferences are held every year, such as those of the Verein für Niederdeutsche
Sprachforschung e.V. [Association for Low German Language Research] and of the
Hansischer Geschichtsverein [Hanseatic Historical Society], which were held in
Quedlinburg on 25 - 27 May 1999.
8. Schleswig- Holstein
Like other undertakings under Article 12, this obligation is implemented indirectly through
Land-sponsored promotion of institutions and associations working in the field of the Low
German la nguage and activities. If and where required, the provisions of Article 12 can be
implemented by these bodies.
These include, in particular, the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the
Low German Language) in Bremen, the Regional Centres for Low German in Leck and
Ratzeburg, the Schleswig-Holsteinischer Heimatbund (SHHB - Schleswig-Holstein Union
for Local and Regional Traditions), and the foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg.
The Centres for Low German in Leck (Schleswig region of the Land) and in Ratzeburg
(Holstein region) were opened in 1994. These Centres are two regional institutions founded
for the task of actively fostering Low German in Schleswig-Holstein and supporting the
work of the groups, instit utions and individuals devoted to this subject matter in the Land. A

231

Board of Curators, composed of representatives from Low German interest groups and
institutions of the Land, monitors and supports the work of these Centres. This body is
chaired by the President of the Schleswig- Holstein Landtag.
The Ministry for Education, Science, Research and Cultural Affairs supports the work of
these Centres, has technical supervision responsibility for them and allocates funds for their
current activities. Teachers have been assigned (as of 1 May and 1 August 2000,
respectively) to the Centes by the provision of one established post each. This was also done
in response to the endeavours to support, in particular, fostering of Low German among
children and youngsters in school. The focus of the work of the two Centres is focused on
information, establishing contacts, documentation, promotional activities in schools, and
public information/education.
In the theatre sector, the multi- genre theatres in Kiel and Lübeck and the Landestheater
actively and continuously dedicate their efforts to the Low German theatre. The
Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund [Union of Low German Theatres] and the Schleswig-Holstein
Landesverband der Amateurtheater [Land Association of Amateur Theatrical Societies] are
supported with Land funds. About half of the performances of the members - some 110 - of
these theatre unions are in the Low German language. The two unions also are granted
additional funds for further training, and the Union of Low German Theatres is refunded
part of the personnel costs for guest directors and the staging of plays at Low German
theatres. In addition, project-related subsidies can be granted for events such as
Niederdeutsches Theatertreffen held at the Molfsee Open-Air Museum, where Low German
stage productions from Schleswig-Holstein and the neighbouring Länder were presented.
In the music sector, several associations receiving institutional promotion by Land funding,
especially the Sängerbund [choral society] Schleswig-Holstein e.V. and the Musikerverband
[Musicians' Union] Schleswig-Holstein e.V. also foster the musical heritage comprising Low
German texts. During the 1994 Schleswig-Holstein-Tag, a much noted event was a Landfunded project of the Land Youth Orchestra, presenting songs of Low German texts 'made
up' in modern jazz arrangements.
In the library sector, the Low German language is promoted, inter alia, by the SchleswigHolstein Central Library Office which offers, and provides access to, literature in the Low
German language and on the Low German language, and organizes writers' readings in Low
German. For this purpose, a special readers' department was established because this sector
of literature is not supported by nation-wide services.
In addition, the Schleswig-Holsteinischer Heimatbund (SHHB - Schleswig- Holstein Union
for Local and Regional Traditions) and other institutions receive project-related funds, in
instances sub stantial amounts, for Low German seminars (especially for children and
youngsters, but also for families, and events addressed to all generations) and for Low
German theatre and directing workshops.

(b)

to foster the different means of access in other languages to works
produced in regional or minority languages by aiding and
developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling
activities;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Bremen allocates funds for required translations, from Low German, of published wo rks.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
On the basis of the Cultural Promotion Directive, the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in this context subsidizes the following projects:
- publication of Middle Low German texts, together with standard German translations;
- publication of Low German texts, with their standard German translations;
- translation of Low German stage-plays into standard German.
As regards stage productions, however, there are only few translations from Low German
into standard German.
No cases of Low German/standard German dubbing, post-synchronization and subtitling are
known.
3. Lower Saxony
As part of literature promotion, funds are available to translators for the translation of literary works - both into and from Low German. Also, a grant can be obtained for a study
placement at a translators' centre.
In this regard, the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German
Language) in Bremen sees itself as a service establishment for all matters relating to
translation. In Ostfriesland, translations are arranged for or made (with Land funds) by the
Plattdütskbüro [Low German Office] of Ostfriesische Landschaft. An updated East Frisian
dictionary, 'Low German - Standard German' and 'Standard German - Low German', was
published by Ostfriesische Landschaft.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
To the extent desired and required, the Low German institutions can use promotional funds
provided by Schleswig- Holstein Land for the translation, dubbing, post-synchronization and
subtitling of works into, or in, the Low German language.
At present, several Schoolbook Commissions develop a three- volume Low German reader
for Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It will be suited for pupils of
all age groups and is planned to be completed in 2000. Co-ordination of the related work
and financial promotion are mainly in the hands of the foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg.

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
With funds allocated to the production of Low German stage performances of plays
originally written in other languages, Bremen promotes the required translations.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
On the basis of the Cultural Promotion Directive, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land in
this context supports the following projects:
- Since the Low German theatres are interested also in staging plays of the standard
German or English speech areas, there are quite a few examples of standard German or
English texts ha ving been translated into Low German.
- In the church sector, translations from standard German into the Low German language
play a special role. A translation of "Dat oll Testament dei Lihrbäuker" [The Old
Testament] by Karl Homuth from Rostock was published already in 1963. A
"Plattdüütsch Gesangbauk" ["Low German Hymn Book"], with Low German liturgy
and Low German prayers, appeared in 1989. The work "Dat ni Testament för plattdüsch
Lüd in ehr Muddersprak oewerdragen" ["The New Testament for Low German
Speakers, translated into their native tongue"] by Ernst Voß (1886 - 1936), which
appeared in 1929, was used for church work. Several - including contemporary - new
editions have appeared.
- Especially with regard to the publication of children's literature, translation of standard
German texts into Low German plays a particular role.
- In the commercial music sector, there is, for instance, the trend that shanty groups have
folk songs or standard German folklore and sailor's songs translated into Low German
since there are only relatively few Low German shanties.
- The full text of the Constitution of the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was
translated into Low German.
3. Lower Saxony
Reference is made to the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (b).
4. Schleswig- Holstein
If so desired and requir ed, the Low German institutions can use promotional funds of the
Land of Schleswig-Holstein for the translation, dubbing, post-synchronization and subtitling
of works into, or in, the Low German language.
The Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German Language) in
Bremen, which is subsidized also by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein, published a Standard
German/Low German Dictionary.
At present, several Schoolbook Commissions develop a three- volume Low German reader
for Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It will be suited for pupils of

234

all age groups and is planned to be completed in 2000. Co-ordination of the related work
and financial promotion are mainly in the hands of the foundation Stiftung Mecklenburg.
In early 2000, the Schleswig- Holstein Landtag published a Low German translation of the
Schleswig- Holstein Land Constitution.
Already since 1995, the frank(ing stamp) of the State Chancellery has included a Low
German translation of parts of Article 1 of the Basic Law [Constitution of the Federal
Republic of Germany].

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Taking Account of the Regional or Minority Language in Cultural
Activities –
(d)

to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for
incorporating the knowledge and use of regional or minority
languages and cultures in the undertakings which they initiate or
for which they provide backing;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
The Parliament of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and the Cultural Department take
account, in their work, of applications by organizations of this language group regarding
promotion of the Low German language and other undertakings.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Hamburg [Senate] Authority for Cultural Affairs itself, in handling applications for
support for Low German literary projects, gives equal priority to such projects and to those
related to standard German. In addition, it encourages the institutions, which are firmly
included in the budget, of the literature sector (Hamburger Öffentliche Bücherhallen
[Hamburg Public Libraries], Literaturhaus [House of Literature], Freie Akademie der
Künste [Academy of Liberal Arts]) to strive for equal treatment of Low German.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
For the accomplishment of their language-related and cultural work, the associations,
poets'/literary societies, publishing houses, theatres, etc., have the required linguistic
expertise at their disposal (cf. the comments below on Article 13, para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "4.
-Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania"). Counselling is offered by the Low German Chairs of
the Rostock and Greifswald Universities, by the Volkskulturinstitut [Institute of the
Kulturbund for Folk Culture, Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania] in Rostock and, for
several Länder, by the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache in Bremen.
Nearly all of the members of the Niederdeutsch-Beirat [Low German Consultative Council]
are individuals ha ving a command also of Low German. Also, the criteria for membership
of the Kulturbeirat [Cultural Consultative Council] of the Ministry of Education include
proficiency in the Low German la nguage, in addition to specialist qualifications.

235

4. Lower Saxony
Throughout Lower Saxony, regional cultural associations of local communities (so-called
Landschaften) have been established, which include regional- language activities and products in their cultural work and are supported in this field by the Land of Lower Saxony.
The Ostfriesische Landschaft in Aurich is subsidized as an institution by the Lower Saxony
Ministry of Scientific and Cultural Affairs. On the basis of the history and structure of this
Landschaft, its tasks refer both to the cultural sector and to science and education. This
ensures that the Low German language and the Low German culture are taken into
consideration in keeping with the accepted obligation.
On account of its history as the last remaining representation of the historic entity of East
Friesland, "Ostfriesische Landschaft" is deeply anchored in the awareness of the popula tion.
It continues to represent the entire population of its region. Nowadays the Assembly of
Ostfriesische Landschaft, which is democratically legitimized by local elections and
organized as a chamber of deputies, constitutes a regional cultural parliament with a regular
statute.
Within the organizational structure of Ostfriesische Landschaft, the Plattdütskbüro [Low
German Office] is part of the Cultural Department. It has the cross-sector task of developing
the use of "East Frisian Low German" as a regional language in private, public and working
life. This requires networking with all other activities pursued by the Landschaft.
Under Agreements concluded with the Land of Lower Saxony, Ostfriesische Landschaft has
been assigned tasks such as the operation of a regional science library and of a regional
educational centre, the organization and implementation of the Regional Teacher Follow-up
Training scheme, or the implementation of the pilot project "Plattdeutsch in der Schule"
["Low German in School"].
The Plattdütskbüro of Ostfriesische Landschaft sees itself as a regional- language
information and networking agency for institutions, groups and individuals in and outside
Ostfriesland. It is involved in many cultural activities organized by clubs, associations or
local authorities, such as the Störtebeker-Freilichtspiele [Störtebeker Open-Air Theatre
Festival] taking place in Marienhafe since 1996.
5. North Rhine/Westphalia
The Landschaftsverband [regional local authority] of Westfalen-Lippe is a co-provider of
the Westphalia and Lippe Local/Regional Traditions Associations which also support the
cultivation of Low German in cultural areas. This ensures, within the meaning of Article 12,
para. 1, sub-para. (d), of the Charter, that appropriate provision is made for the cultivation of
the regional language in undertakings organized by these bodies.
6. Schleswig- Holstein
With subsidies provided by Schleswig-Holstein, the institutions of the speakers of Low
German ensure that appropriate provision is made for incorporating the knowledge and use
of the Low German language and culture in their cultural activities.
The regional language Low German still is, as a secondary language, widely used mainly in
rural areas and by the older pouplation.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (e) - Employment of Staff Proficient in the Language(s) Concerned –
(e)

to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organising or supporting cultural activities have at their disposal
staff who have a full command of the regional or minority language
concerned, as well as of the language(s) of the rest of the
population;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
The Ernst-Waldau-Theater in Bremen has a drama school where young actors are
familiarized with the Low German language.
2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
As already stated with reference to para. 1, sub-para. (d) - "3. Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania", the institutions for language-related and cultural work have at their disposal
staff members having a command of the Low German language. Further examples of the
active involvement of staff speaking Low German are the Fachgruppe Niederdeutsch of the
Landesheimatverband [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and
Regional Traditions] and the body co-ordinating the Low German Competition in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
Speakers of the Low German language are also represented on the Landesarbeitskreis
Kultur, a joint body of Land Associations which every year prepare and organize the
Landeskulturtage [Land Cultural Days] in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The 1999
Landeskulturtage were held in Waren-Müritz where Low German was the subject of two
events concerning Richard Wossidlo.
3. Lower Saxony
Like the many other unions and associations organizing events, such as Oostfreeske Taal
[East Frisian Low German] or De Spieker, Heimatbund für niederdeutsche Kultur e.V. [a
local/ regional traditions association for Low German culture], Ostfriesische Landschaft has
staff members speaking the Low German language.
4. North Rhine/Westphalia
The activities described above with regard to para. 1, sub-para. (d) - "5. North
Rhine/Westphalia", promote measures, also within the meaning of Article 12, para. 1, subpara. (e), in order to ensure that the bodies responsible for organizing cultural activities also
have Low German speaking staff at their disposal.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (f) - Participation of Representatives of the Group Speaking the Given
Language in Cultural Activities –
(f)

to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities;

1. Brandenburg
Legislation to regulate the participation by Low German speakters in cultural institutions is
considered unnecessary: dealing with the Low German language and culture requires
proficiency in this language; thus, participation of users of the Low German language is
already ensured within the institutions concerned.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
As regards the institutions described under para. 1, sub-paras. (a) to (g), and their activities
and events, it is primarily persons having a command of the Low German language who are
the initiators and who carry out the pertinent activities.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Hamburg [Senate] Authority for Cultural Affairs provides co- funding for the Institut für
niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low Germa n Language) in Bremen; the
Institute's full-time and voluntary staff and members carry out a considerable range of
cultural planning and counselling.
4. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
The comments on para. 1, sub-para. (e) - "2. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania", show that
representatives speaking the regional language Low German participate in the planning and
co-ordination of Land-wide activities (e.g. Low German Competition, Land Cultural Days)
and are represented at many local and municipal jubilees. In 1999, the first Land-wide 'Low
German Day' was organized at the initiative of the Landesheimatverband MecklenburgVorpommern e.V. [Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Land Union for Local and Regional
Traditions].
5. Lower Saxony
As already stated with reference to para. 1, sub-paras. (d) and (e), many full-time staff and
voluntary members are involved in the planning and implementation of events in the
regional language. In this context, mention should be made of an event held in 1996 at the
Land Mission of Lower Saxony in Bonn and organized in co-operation with the
aforementioned associations with the aim of increasing the awareness of Members of the
Bundestag with regard to Low German.
6. North Rhine/Westphalia
The activities of the Landschaftsverband [regional local authority] of Westfalen-Lippe, as
described under para. 1, sub-para. (d) - "5. North Rhine/Westphalia" above, also provide,
within the meaning of Article 13, para. 1, sub-para. (f), for encouraging direct participation

238

by representatives of the users of the Low German language in the provision and planning
of cultural activities.
7. Saxony-Anhalt
Direct participation in the provision of facilities and planning of cultural activities is ensured
through the Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V. [Saxony-Anhalt Land Union for Local
and Regional Traditions] (especially the Head of the Low German Section) and the
Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch [Workshop for Low German] of Otto von Guericke University
in Magdeburg. Both institutions usually are also the main actors as regards a wide range of
Low German activities.
Participation in the planning of cultural activities is, in addition, possible through the
Landesheimatbund Sachsen-Anhalt e.V. since the Arbeitskeis "Ostfälisches Platt" e.V.
[Working Pane l "Low German of Ostfalen"] automatically is a member of the Executive
Board.
8. Schleswig- Holstein
Every two years, the Land of Schleswig- Holstein organizes the Schleswig-Holstein-Tag as a
central cultural event. Among the clubs, associations and unions are many having their roots
in the Low German culture. The functions of the executive secretariat of the
Landeskuratorium for the Schleswig-Holstein Day are performed by the SchleswigHolsteinischer Heimatbund (SHHB), an association which vigorously supports Low
German interests. The Land provides moral, financial and organizational support for the
organization of the Schleswig-Holstein-Tag and for the work of the Landeskuratorium.
Since 1993, the Schleswig- Holstein Land Mission [at the site of the Federal Government],
in co-operation with the SHHB, has (previously in Bonn) organized a "Low German
evening" with music, theatre and literature. Members of the Bundestag, from all
parliamentary groups, are thus brought into contact with Low German.
On 12 September 1999, the first Land-wide "Plattdeutscher Tag" ["Low German Day"] was
held at the initiative of the SHHB. For the duration of one month (September), more than
100 events were organized in many places throughout Schleswig-Holstein.
re: para. 1, sub-para. (g) - Creation of Archive Bodies –
(g)

to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or
publishing works produced in the regional or minority languages;

1. Brandenburg
Publishers are required to offer at least one copy of every printed work that is newly
published in Brandenburg to the Staats- und Landesbibliothek [State and Land Library].
This also covers publications in the Low German language. The extent to which use is made
of such offers is not known. Otherwise, there is no central registration of Low German
writings and documents.

239

Otherwise, there are no libraries or archives dedicated exclusively to the collection of Low
German writings; rather, they are collected in public libraries and archives of various
providing bodies, especially Kreis and municipal archives and libraries. No central surveys
are made on the size and contents of such archives so that no information can be provided
on the subject.
These archives provide the interested public with access to Low German writings and other
materials held in the archives in accordance with the provisions of the "Act of 7 April 1994
on the Safeguarding and Use of Public Archives in the Land of Brandenburg". Public access
to libraries is ensured anyhow.
2. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
The archives in the Land of Bremen include many works by Low German writers and
various writings/manuscripts in the Low German language. The public has unrestricted
access. The holdings of such writings/documents and of pertinent aids (inter alia,
dictionaries, lexicons) are complemented on a continuing basis. As a result of the close cooperation between archives and institutions, whose tasks include the cultivation and
fostering of the Low German language, the records and documents of these institutions are
taken over by the archives so as to make them available to the public. The Stadtarchiv
[Municipal Archives] in Bremen promotes historical research carried out by the various
associations and "Krings" ["Circles"] as well as research on the Low German language.
The libraries in the Land of Bremen make a basic stock of Low German titles available, the
selection of which is based on target groups and which are treated on an equal basis with
regard to other categories of books. The libraries co-operate with the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German Language) within the framework of
external loan services.
The collection activities of the historical museums of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen include the fields of dialect literature and dialectology. The museum libraries maintain similar
collections which are constantly expanded.
In the two cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven, the respective Department for Cultural
Affairs provides advice and funding to the associations and initiatives dedicated to the
promotion of the Low German language. These institutions include "KRINGS" [Circles] and
"Speeldeels" [drama clubs] as well as local/regional traditions clubs which devote their
efforts to the presentation of Low German literature. In Bremerhaven, the Niederdeutsche
Bühne [Low German Theatre] is supported by the Breme rhaven Stadttheater [Municipal
Theatre]; in Bremen, the Ernst-Waldau-Theater which presents a major part of its stage
productions in Low German is granted an annual subsidy.
Publications in the Low German language are subsidized, for a major part, by the Institut für
niederdeutsche Sprache.
3. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
This obligation is implemented through the promotion of the Institut für Niederdeutsche
Sprache (in this regard, cf. the introductory remarks to our comments on Article 12, para. 1,
sub-para (a) above).
4. Lower Saxony

240

Central tasks of the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache (INS - Institute for the Low German
Language) in Bremen, which is also subsidized by the Land of Lower Saxony, are the
collection, classification and scholarly analysis of Low German linguistic material. At
present, the INS library comprises some 15,000 media units.
Both the Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek [State and University Library] in Göttingen and
the library of Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg have abundant holdings of Low
German literature. In addition, the Municipal Libraries of the Land capital Hanover own the
Börsmann Collection, comprising some 5,000 media units. The (Land-funded) library of
Ostfriesische Landschaft also owns a collection of Low German literature.
The publishing house Verlag Schuster in Leer attends to the dictionaries published by the
INS and by Ostfriesische Landschaft and the Low German Grammar; it also publishes
standard works of the Low German language and folklore as well as a number of works by
well-known old and new Low German authors.
5. North Rhine/Westphalia
One of the priority tasks of the "Dialects and Study of Names [Onomastics, Toponymy]"
Commission of the Landschaftsverband of Westfalen-Lippe - cf. the comments on para. 1,
sub-para. (a) - "5. North Rhine/Westphalia" - are archival recording of Low German
linguistic material [and] the registration of Westphalian dialects, local field names and
proverbs.
6. Saxony-Anhalt
The establishments and institutions subsidized by the Land of Saxony-Anhalt (cf. also the
comments on sub-para. (f) above) collect Low German works and, within the framework of
public information/education, make them known to a large reading public.
7. Schleswig- Holstein
The Low German language is promoted in many and various ways by the library system of
Schleswig- Holstein, inter alia by the Büchereizentrale Schleswig-Holstein [Library Centre
of Schleswig-Holstein]. This is done by offering and publicizing literature about, and in,
Low German and by organizing writers' readings in Low German. For this purpose, a
special Readers' Department was established since this sector of literature is not supported
by nation-wide services. A comprehensive review of the market - advertising leaflets of
publishing houses, magazines and contacts with the relevant authors - ensures that account
is taken also of publications on the non-professional sector. These books are reviewed by
the Readers' Department, and lists are drawn up of those recommended for purchase by
libraries.
Literature about, and in, Low German is kept as a separate category so that the library customers have quick and direct access to such books.
Mention is to be made of the following libraries:

241

242

Schleswig-Holsteinische Landesbibliothek (Schleswig-Holstein Land Library)
One of the priorities of the Schleswig-Holstein Land Library is the collection of works
related to the Low German language and Schleswig-Holstein Low German literature.
The printed works referring to the Low German language, covering the fields of
language history, grammar, dictionaries, onomastics/toponymy, dialects and church
language number some 500 titles.
To the extent possible, the aim is complete procurement of the works of all SchleswigHolstein writers and of the literature about them. In addition, there are collections of
Low German legends, folk tales, nursery rhymes, proverbs and anecdotes, and Low
German songbooks and works on the history and geography of the Land.
The Manuscript and Unpublished Works Section of the Landesbibliothek owns the unpublished works of several authors writing in Low German, such as Klaus Groth, Johann Hinrich Fehrs, Hans Ehrke, and others.
Universitätsbibliothek Kiel (Kiel University Library)
Kiel University Library owns several manuscripts and incunabula in the Low German
language. Of particular importance is the Middle Low German Bordesholmer
Marienklage [Mary's Lament, of Bordesholm], of which a TV production video and a
CD are available. In addition, there are several thousands of books, mainly on the
subjects of linguistics, study of literature, fiction and poetry [belles lettres], and the
study of the ma terial culture and customs.
The Germanistisches Institut of Christian-Albrechts-Universität in Kiel has a
Department for (and Chair of) Low German Language and Literature, to which the
Klaus-Groth-Archiv for research on the beginnings of new Low German dialect
literature is affiliated. With more than 5,000 Low German titles, the Department for
Low German Language and Literature is one of the largest specialized libraries in this
field. Almost half of the books are literary works in the Low German language
published since 1850. Also, past and contemporary works referring to the Low German
language and literature are collected. These holdings also include manuscripts of Low
German radio plays. In addition, the Department has various collections referring to
Low German.
Zentrale Hochschulbibliothek Flensburg (Central University Library of Flensburg)
The Flensburg Central University Library is developing a basic stock of Low German
literature. So far, only few titles acquired recently and a small number of old holdings
are available. The planned priorities are:
- Low German linguistics and study of literature;
- Low German fiction and poetry; and
- the study of material culture and customs (folklore).

243

re: para. 1, sub-para. (h) - Translation and Terminological Research Services –
(h)

if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to
maintaining and developing appropriate administrative, commercial,
economic, social, technical or legal terminology in each regional or
minority language.

1. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
As regards the regional language Low German, the requirement is not for any newly created
translation and terminological research services. Rather, the issue is to make use of the
existing capacities also for the areas of administration, commerce, economy, society,
technology and law. The aim is, in particular, to develop appropriate terminology, in cooperation with the Low German Chairs of the Rostock and Greifswald Universities and with
the Institut für Volkskunde [Institute of Folklore] of the Rostock University (Wossidlo
Archives). Additional sources available are the Mecklenburgisches Wörterbuch
[Mecklenburg Dictionary] and the Pommersches Wörterbuch [Pomeranian Dictionary].
Help with translations and terminology is also provided by the Volkskulturinstitut Mecklenburg und Vorpommern im Kulturbund e.V. [Folk Culture Institute of the Kulturbund,
Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania] and by the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache e.V.
(INS - Institute for the Low German Language) in Bremen.
2. North Rhine/Westphalia
As regards the tasks of the Commission on "Dialects and Name Research
[Onomastics/Toponymy]", mentioned in the comments above on para. 1, sub-para. (a) - "5.
North Rhine/Westphalia", terminological research services within the meaning of Article
12, para. 1, sub-para. (h), of the Charter have been established.
3. Saxony-Anhalt
If required, the establishments and institutions listed under sub-para. (f) above provide
translation and terminological research services as part of their ongoing Land- funded
activities.

re: Art. 12, para. 2
(2)
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow,
encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in
accordance with the preceding paragraph.
In Germany, cultural activities keeping within the framework of the law in force are not
subject to any permit procedure or restrictions. Thus, the above obligation is already
fulfilled by the system of law in the Federal Republic of Germany. More extensive

244

implementation of this obligation by encouraging or providing such activities will have to
be decided by the Länder on a case-by-case basis.

1. Lower Saxony
Since cultural promotion in Lower Saxony generally includes Low German, there are no
regional limitations to the territory in which Low German is mainly spoken.
2. North Rhine/Westphalia
Under the existing system of law, cultural activities in North Rhine/Westphalia are admitted
also in territorial areas other than those where the regional language Low German is
traditionally used.

re: Art. 12, para. 3
(3)
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing
their cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the
cultures they reflect.
1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
Within the "Neue Hanse Interregio" (NHI - New Hanseatic Interregio), an association of the
Länder of Bremen and Lower Saxony, and of West-Friesland (Netherlands, provinces of
Drenthe, Fryslân, Groningen and Overijssel), cultural events also include Low German as
the typical language of Northern Germany.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
The Hamburg Senate Authority for Cultural Affairs makes provision for the accepted
obligation in its activities. So far, however, no concrete information is available on
participation in the cultural policy abroad.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
Within the framework of cultural exchanges with the Baltic Republics, the Scandinavian
countries and Poland, folklore ensembles from the Land of Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania give performances abroad. In addition to presenting the customs and traditions as
a part of the Low German culture, choral works and songs also use the Low German
language.
4. Lower Saxony
Cultural activities within the "Neue Hanse Interregio" (NHI), an association of the Länder
of Bremen and Niedersachsen and West-Friesland (Netherlands), also include the Low
German language.

245

Mention is to be made also of an Art School Project subsidized by the Land of Lower
Saxony-Anhalt; under this project, Internet contacts are to be established with the
descendants of Lower Saxony emigrants to America. The Low German language is used for
mutual communication in this context.
5. Schleswig- Holstein
In the 19th Century, many inhabitants of Schleswig- Holstein emigrated to the United States.
The focus of Schleswig-Holstein immigration was the State of Iowa, with Davenport, West
of Chicago, as its central place. Until our days, people there - often the fourth or fifth
generation - have been using German or Low German as their language of everyday oral
communication.
Until this day, close contacts have been maintained between Schleswig-Holstein and the
descendants of the former immigrants. This year, the 3rd Plattdüütsch Konferenz [Low
German Conference] took place in Wausau (Wisconsin), in which also a group from
Schleswig- Holstein took part. The Conference featured a number of presentations and
examples, also with regard to the use of the Schleswig- Holstein variety of Low German in
Iowa.
In 1998, with funds provided by the Minister-President, a Low German Conference was
held at the Schleswig-Holstein open-air museum of Molfsee. Participants included a
delegation of the American/Schleswig-Holstein Heritage Society (ASHHS) of Davenport.
The ASHHS was founded in 1986 by descendants of immigrants from Schleswig- Holstein,
and has a membership of some 1,000 in fourty U.S. States. Within the ASHHS, the Low
German language is cultivated; even a Low German/English Dictionary was published. The
Society keeps up close co-operation with associations in Schleswig-Holstein.
The Department of Low German Language and Literature of the Kiel University carried out
a research project, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG - German
Research Found ation), on Low German speech islands in North America (Iowa) and
Paraguay.
There is lively co-operation with scholars from Scandinavia, the Baltic countries, Russia,
the Netherlands and Belgium in the field of Low German philology. These contacts are
comple mented by student exchange programmes with Groningen (Netherlands), Gent
(Belgium) and Halden (Norway). Also, the Internationaler Wissenschaftlicher Ferienkurs
der Universität Kiel [International Academic Holiday Course of Kiel University"] entitled
"Deutschland heute - Sprache, Gesellschaft, Staat, Kultur" ["Present-Day Germany Language, Society, State, Culture"] offers a series of courses and lectures on Low German,
which are attended by the foreign participants.

Article 13
Economic and Social Life
(1)
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake
within the whole country:
(a)
to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or
limiting without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority

246

(b)

(c)

languages in documents relating to economic or social life,
particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
to prohibit the insertion, in internal regulations of companies and
private documents, of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of
regional or minority languages, at least between users of the same
language;
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;

The obligations under sub-paras. (a) and (c) have been accepted by the Länder of Bremen,
Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia and
Schleswig- Holstein.
These obligations are in compliance with the established law of the Federal Republic of
Germany and thus are fulfilled nation-wide for all regional or minority languages.
Therefore, no special measures had to be taken by these Länder.

re: para. 1, sub-para. (d) - Facilitating the Use of the Regional or Minority Language –
(d)

to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority
languages by means other than those specified in the above
subparagraphs.

This obligation has been accepted by the Länder of Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony, North Rhine/Westphalia and Schleswig- Holstein.
In Germany, the freedom to use one's own language - in public and in private life - is
guaranteed by Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Basic Law. Use of minority languages in public
is generally accepted by the German population. There are no reservations in this regard.
There are many and various ways in which the learning and use of minority languages are
promoted by the State (cf. the comments on the various obligations), and thus, as a result of
this implementation measure, use of Low German is encouraged and facilitated. In
particular, efforts are encouraged among the general public to keep these languages alive by
using them within the family and in extra-familiar everyday- life situations. In this regard,
the cultural value of the minority languages for Germany's cultural life is particularly emphasized so that, as a result of the ensuing self- esteem and self- assurance, the younger
generation will be more willing to adopt these languages and pass them on.
For the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the following information is to be added:
In the areas of product advertising and tourist advertising, use is made of the Low German
language. Thus, for instance, guided city tour s of Schwerin are in Low German. In addition,
the Staatliches Museum Schwerin offers guided tours of the museum in the Low German
language.
When choosing a name for themselves, restaurants, inns and pubs often use Low German
words, and local/regional specialties are presented in Low German on the menu.

247

In terms of private enterprise, Low German is a top product which is a determining feature
of the special character of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Thus, for instance, a
possibility would be to develop an alternative tourism programme under which tourists
would not only enjoy the beautiful landscape but would, during their vacation, take a
beginners' course in the Low German language, literature and culture. After two annual
courses, participants could acquire the Low German Diploma - Stage 1 while the Diploma Stage 2 would be granted only after an additional stay.
At the tourist centres, Low German theatre groups might give performances, and specific
language learning courses in Low German might be taught.
Another example of tourist activities might be a summer nursery-school for holiday guests.
In these summer nursery-schools, the children of tourists could learn Mecklenburg songs
and dances, familiarize themselves with Low German, and get to know the Low German
language and be introduced to the special features of this Land.
Also, it surely would be a good thing if various Low German festivals could be organized at
the holiday centres within a reasonable timeframe (theatre, music, literature, etc.) so as to
draw attention to the special features of the Land also in this way.
Pertinent initiatives should be discussed with the Tourist Association.

re: Art. 13, para. 2
(2)

With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake,
in so far as the public authorities are competent, within the territory
in which the regional or minority languages are used, and as far as
this is reasonably possible:

re: para. 2, sub-para. (c) - Use of the Regional or Minority Language in Social Care
Facilities –
(c)

to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement
homes and hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in
their own language persons using a regional or minority language
who are in need of care on grounds of ill-health, old age or for other
reasons;

1. Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
In Bremen, hospitals, retirement homes and nursing services offer their services in such a
way that speakers of Low German can be admitted and treated in their own language.
Various establishments are preparing lists of the staff members having a knowledge of this
language. Special account is taken of the Low German language in the information brochure
on the existing care and nursing facilities, which was prepared by the Verbraucherzentrale
Bremen [Bremen Consumer Protection Centre] on behalf of governmental agencies.
2. Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg

248

A number of retirement homes have occupants who still speak Low German. In such cases it
is ensured, as a rule, that the nursing staff/attendants can provide such language-specific
care. What the city of Hamburg cannot do, however, is to ensure that all persons in need of
care can generally be provided such care also in the Low German language. Yet in view of
the actual state of affairs, this would not seem necessary since, even among the elderly,
there usually is nobody who understands and speaks Low German but not the standard
German language. Should such cases exist, however, the respective establishment will
endeavour to find an adequate solution.
3. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
At present, use of the regional language Low German in social care facilities, such as
hospitals, retirement homes and hostels, depends on whether these facilities accommodate
persons having a command of Low German. Use of the regional language Low German in
social care facilities is more frequent and widespread in rural areas than in towns and cities.
4. Schleswig- Holstein
Staff members speaking Low German are available in the specialized clinics of the Land.
It should be pointed out that direct nursing and other care of persons in need of nursing and
care is not a public-sector responsibility, but rather is mostly carried out by private-sector
providing bodies and free nonprofit institutions. Thus, for instance, only 8 % of the more
than 1,000 approved nursing facilities in Schleswig-Holstein are provided by incorporated
public- law institutions. None of these facilities is provided directly by the Land. Therefore,
it is not possible to lay down any requirements to be met by the various providing bodies as
regards the use of the regional language Low German. However, the Ministries with
responsibility in this field have until now not been notified of any cases which might give
cause for requiring certain institutions to provide permanently for staff with knowledge of
this language. Anyhow, there are no language barriers regarding oral communication in the
various regions of the Land.
Article 14
Transfrontier Exchanges
The Parties undertake:
(a)

(b)

to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind
them with the States in which the same language is used in identical
or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude such agreements,
in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of the same
language in the States concerned in the fields of culture, education,
information, vocational training and permanent education;
for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or
promote co-operation across borders, in particular between regional
or local authorities in whose territory the same language is used in
identical or similar form.

1. Lower Saxony

249

The obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b) have been accepted only by the Land of Lower
Saxony.
The Neue Hanse Interregio (NHI - New Hansa Interregio) was founded in 1991 by the
Heads of Go vernment of the German Länder of Lower Saxony and Bremen, and of the
Netherlands provinces of Drenthe, Fryslân, Groningen and Overijssel. The agreement
concluded by these co-operation partners is geared to transfrontier co-operation designed to
strengthen the regions involved. The NHI's central policy areas are trade and industry,
transport, research and development, environmental protection and nature conservation,
agriculture and farming, culture and education, and labour market and social policy.
For the area of 'culture and education', the following was agreed, inter alia: "In the context
of European integration and in view of the networking of regions, interregional cultural
exchanges and transfrontier co-operation in the cultural area have an outstanding function
because they help to bring people together and to foster mutual understanding."
In this context, increasing attention must also be given to the instruction in the various
languages in schools and in all areas of adult education. Against this background, the
Länder and Provinces work towards achieving increased co-operation among cultural
institutions and in educational matters of the co-operation area. This co-operation is to focus
on promoting the cultivation of regional la nguages and dialects in their respective speech
area.
Local governments, municipalities, local authority unions, Landkreise, Chambers and other
public- law corporations in the Netherlands Provinces of Groningen and Drenthe and, in
Germany, in the Landkreise of Aurich, Leer, Wittmund, Emsland and Cloppenburg and in
the kreisfreie Stadt of Emden in Ostfriesland have formed the special-purpose association
Ems-Dollart Region (Eems-Dollard Regio - EDR). In addition to economic co-operation,
the task of this community syndicate is to promote the region's culture in a transfrontier
context.
The common language spoken in this border region was used, for instance, during the 1997
EDR Festival, an event commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Ems-Dollart Re gion and
providing the occasion for holding the European Cultural Days in the town of Leer.
Reciters, readers, writers and similar artists from the Province of Groningen were, and still
are, invited to participate in events within the framework of the Bücherfrühling ["Spring of
Books", a Land-wide literature event] in Lower Saxony.
2. Schleswig- Holstein
These obligations have not been explicitly adopted by the Land of Schleswig-Holstein. Nevertheless, reference is made, in this context, to the comments above on Article 13, para. 3 "5. Schleswig-Holstein".

[Draft State Report, as of 30 June 2000]

Additional Declaration by the Federal Republic of Germany for the Implementation of
Obligations under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, regarding
Part II of the Charter
"Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages shall be
applied to Romany, the minority language of the German Sinti and Roma, in
the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the
