A. Introduction
The Fifth Report of the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with Article 15 (1) of
the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (the Charter) was prepared by
the Federal Ministry of the Interior in cooperation with other federal ministries and the
responsible state authorities, and in consultation with the federal associations of the
speakers of the languages protected by the Charter. The drafting process started with an
implementation conference of all stakeholders which took place in Berlin on 26 and 27
April 2012. The federal associations were invited to share their views about the
implementation of the Charter in Germany, which do not have be in line with those of the
authorities. Their comments are included in Section F of this report. A second
implementation conference took place in Berlin on 13 December 2012 to finalize the
state report.
The report covers the period from July 2010 to December 2012.
General information about the regional and minority languages protected in Germany
are included in the First Report of the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with
Article 15 (1) of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages on pages 3 to
28. The report is available at
http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/Report/PeriodicalReports/GermanyPR1_en.pdf

in English and at
http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Broschueren/2000/erster_staatenbericht.html?nn=110428

in German.

B. Updated geographic and demographic information
In the period under review, the Frisian settlement area in north-western Lower Saxony
was defined more precisely. According to a soon-to-be-published study commissioned
and funded by the Federal Ministry of the Interior the settlement area includes the rural
districts of Aurich, Leer, Friesland and Wittmund, the urban districts of Emden and
Wilhelmshaven as well as individual areas such as the rural districts of Cuxhaven and
Wesermarsch. Low German has been spoken in this area since at least the 18th
century.

11

C. General trends
I. Division of competences between the federal and state levels
In its last report, the Committee of Experts notes that the division of competences
between the federal and state governments remains an issue in relation to practical
implementation of the Charter in Germany.
In the majority of cases, the federal states are responsible for implementing the
undertakings of the Charter in practice. The chosen undertakings are specified in the
German implementing act. This act is federal law. Responsibility for the implementation
of the Act rests with the sates pursuant to Articles 83 of the Basic Law. They execute
federal laws in their own right, i.e. they are free to become active and decide how to
implement the laws. However, this includes the duty to become active (Rulings of the
Federal Constitutional Court 75, 108 (150); 55, 274 (318); 41, 291 (312); 37, 363 (385)),
including the obligation to provide for the necessary authorities and administrative
resources.
Since responsibility for enforcement lies with the states, the federal level cannot
intervene, i.e. it cannot invoke sovereignty rights when the states enforce federal law
reluctantly or incorrectly and remains bound by the right to issue instructions and the
right to supervision under Article 84 of the Basic Law.
Thus, the Basic Law provides clear guidance on how to implement the undertakings in
practice. Given the federal system enshrined in the constitution, speakers do not have
only one point of contact for addressing their concerns but may have to contact several
states. This is a particular burden for the representatives of Low German speakers
because Low German is spoken in as many as eight states. In addition, the individual
states apply different standards.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior is trying to compensate for this disadvantage of
Germany’s federal system for the stakeholders. To this end, it organizes an
implementation conference at least once a year, inviting representatives from several
federal ministries, from the states and from the four national minorities and language
groups in Germany. Participants may put any topics related to the Council of Europe
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities or the Charter on the
agenda. During the consultations, representatives of the language groups have the
opportunity to talk to all responsible government bodies. Another annual event is the
Länder-Bund Referententagung Niederdeutsch, a meeting of federal and state officials
on Low German . It is a platform for exchanging information, both among the states
where Low German is spoken and with federal authorities and the speakers.
Moreover, all domestic policy issues related to the respective languages are discussed
in consultative committees. So far, the following committees have been set up at the
Federal Ministry of the Interior: the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning the
Danish Minority, the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning the Sorbian People,
the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning the Frisian Ethnic Group in Germany,
and the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning the Low German Language
Group. Meetings are held ad hoc, but at least once a year and if at least three members
apply for convening a meeting. Usually, each committee meets once a year. The
composition of the committees is governed by their respective statutes and may vary.

12
However, representatives of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, of the language group
and of the responsible state authorities always participate. A member may request that
members of the German Bundestag, other ministries and experts be invited to the
meetings. The meeting agendas are prepared by the chair in consultation with the
members of the committee. At the committee meetings, representatives of the national
minorities and the language groups may directly address senior officials of the Federal
Ministry of the Interior and members of the Bundestag. The minorities and language
groups appreciate this direct exchange, which thus complements the regular contacts at
working level.

II. Cooperation across states
In its last report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
present the cooperation between state authorities with regard to the protection and
promotion of Low German.
The regional language Low German is spoken in eight states of the Federal Republic of
Germany (Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower
Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein). This is very
challenging for federal and state authorities and the representatives of the Low German
speakers because they have to coordinate very closely to protect and promote the
language. Hence, to simplify cooperation and to share experience, the meeting of
federal and state officials on Low German has been held annually in one of the states
concerned since 2007. Participants include representatives of the ministries concerned
and of the states, the Federal Ministry of the Interior and representatives of the
Bundesrat für Niederdeutsch (Federal Council for Low German), a representative body
of the Low German speakers. So far, six two-day meetings have taken place in different
states. The meetings repeatedly focused on education. In addition, participants
discussed the role of Low German in the media, administration and justice as well as in
old age. The next meeting will take place at the invitation of Schleswig-Holstein in
Lübeck in May 2013.

III. Changed framework conditions
The following legislative amendments as well as practical and actual changes in the
report period have an impact on the languages protected under the Charter:
In July 2012 the parliament of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen adopted an amended
Media Act imposing new diversity requirements on private broadcasters. The new
Section 13 (3) calls on broadcasters to include an appropriate amount of broadcasts in
Low German in their programmes. Paragraph 3 emphasizes the promotion of the Low
German language and codifies the call for more broadcasts in Low German.
In addition, the Senate of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen concluded a framework
agreement with the German Sinti and Roma Association of Bremen on 17 July 2012.
Through the agreement, the Senate expresses its respect of the history of German Sinti
and Roma and recognizes their ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity.
Moreover, it aims at promoting participation of Sinti and Roma living in Bremen in
cultural, social and economic life and in public affairs. In the fields of language, culture
and education the state government intends to improve the participation and success of
Sinti and Roma children by implementing educational measures tailored to their needs.
The Senate confirms its commitment to the undertakings accepted under the Charter for

13
Regional or Minority Languages. Bremen is the second state concluding the partnership
through such an agreement, after Rhineland-Palatinate.
In its budget for 2012 and 2013 Lower Saxony provides for € 450,000 in funding to
promote Low German and Sater Frisian in schools. In addition, funding of the
Landschaften and Landschaftsverbände (municipal associations) for promoting regional
culture has been increased by € 600,000 to provide more targeted project support for
Low German and Sater Frisian. Overall, € 1.15 million are earmarked for research and
education to better integrate the Low German and Sater Frisian languages in these
areas.
On 24 April 2012 the government of Saxony adopted a plan to stimulate and encourage
the use of the Sorbian language. The plan calls for measures to improve language skills,
increase the use of the Sorbian language in public life and to impart knowledge about
the Sorbian language, culture and tradition.
On 14 November 2012 the Schleswig-Holstein parliament unanimously adopted the
amended state constitution. The state now expressly protects and promotes also the
national minority of German Sinti and Roma. Following the parliament’s unanimous vote,
the parliament’s president will establish a committee for this minority. Like the existing
committees for the Frisian ethnic group and for the German minority in Northern
Schleswig, this committee will be composed of members from all parliamentary groups
and minority representatives.
In addition Schleswig-Holstein reported that the state’s School Act (SchulG) of
24 January 2007 was amended on 28 January 2011. The state also noted that the new
state government, a coalition of SPD, Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and SSW, has announced
another amendment of the School Act effective 1 January 2013, restoring the 2007
version of Section 124 “Subsidies irrespective of need, amount of subsidy”. The
statement reads: “We will restore full equality of pupils at Danish schools by introducing
cost-per-pupil rates (Schülerkostensatz) based on the 2007 School Act. In 2012, the
state government will look into how Section 114 of the Schools Act can be amended to
cover allowances for the transport of pupils to schools of the Danish minority, in an effort
to establish the equality of Danish minority schools and public schools.”

IV.

Brochure of the Federal Ministry of the Interior

In 2012 the Federal Ministry of the Interior published a new brochure on minorities and
regional and minority languages on its website to draw the attention of a broad audience
to the minorities and their languages, including the regional language of Low German
and its speakers. The brochure will be published in print in 2013.

V.

Sinti music festival

Since 2001 the Verein Hildesheimer Sinti e.V., the Lower Saxony regional association of
the Sinti Allianz Deutschland, has been organizing an international Sinti music festival.
The festival has an international reputation and every year attracts German and
European visitors to Hildesheim. Funding is provided by the city of Hildesheim, the
Lower Saxony Ministry for Research and Culture, the Friedrich-Weinhagen-Stiftung, the
regional local authority Landschaftsverband Hildesheim and Sparkasse Hildesheim.

and the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (INS – Institute for the Low German
Language) organized the conference “Mit den Regional- und Minderheitensprachen auf
dem Weg nach Europa – Mehrsprachigkeit, Sprachwandel und Sprachenschutz als
Herausforderung für die Bildungssysteme” (regional and minority languages on their way
to Europe –multilingualism, language change and language protection as a challenge of
education systems) in Berlin to promote and protect regional or minority languages. The
Federal Ministry of the Interior provided funding for the event.

VII.

Language contest

The second language contest “Serbska rěc jo žywa – Serbska rěč je žiwa –
Sprachenfreundliche Kommune” (language-friendly community) took place in 2011/2012.
It is organized once in a legislative term under the auspices of the parliament presidents
of Saxony and Brandenburg, the two councils for Sorbian/Wendish and Sorbian affairs,
and Domowina. The aim is to raise awareness among municipalities of the Sorbian
languages and to encourage their use. Some municipalities participating in the contest
significantly increased their activities, e.g. in using the languages when presenting
themselves to the public.

VIII.

Europeada

In June 2012, the time of the European football championships, members of the Sorbian
people organized the second European football championships of language
(autochthonous) minorities in Upper Lusatia, Saxony. The event was an opportunity for
participants to meet members of other minorities and learn more about Lusatia and the
Sorbs. It was hosted by Domowina, the umbrella organization of the Sorbian
associations and organizations in Lusatia, together with the Federal Union of European
Nationalities. Saxony’s Minister-President Stanislaw Tillich, also a member of the
Sorbian people, agreed to serve as patron. Europeada 2012 was also supported by the
Free State of Saxony, the Westlausitzer Fußballverband e.V., the Federal Ministry of the
Interior and the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk broadcasting station.

Discussion at the German Bundestag

On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signing of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages by Germany, the German Bundestag discussed
language protection in Germany and adopted a list of requirements at its 211th session
on 29 November 2012. Taking account of their responsibilities specified in the Basic
Law, the federal and state governments were asked to


present national minorities in Germany a report on the situation of regional and
minority languages once per legislative term;



present the responsible Bundestag Committee on Internal Affairs the fourth and
all subsequent monitoring reports of the Council of Europe Committee of
Ministers;



develop a global strategy promoting regional and minority languages together
with the representatives of minority and regional languages in Germany, setting
goals for certain areas of society and outlining possible approaches;

15


examine whether it makes sense to protect minority and regional languages as
intangible cultural heritage;



ensure that a national conference of representatives of regional and minority
languages widens the perspective on language protection and promotion beyond
minorities and ethnic groups;



ensure that regional and minority languages have a greater impact in educational
institutions, schools, universities, administration and the media in line with the
undertakings entered into under the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages;



adopt and implement the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers
regarding the application of the Charter in Germany in line with the fourth report
of the Committee of Experts;



improve strategies for learning regional and minority languages in Germany in the
medium term and tailored to the needs of the individual languages;



develop strategies for securing the future of regional and minority languages in
cooperation with the language and minority policy bodies of the individual groups;



intensify the promotion of German language cultivation and preservation among
German minorities in Europe in the framework of support policy and cultural
policy abroad.

The federal government and the state governments will seek to implement these
requirements in the framework of their constitutional competences.

X. Music contest
The Friesenrat Sektion Nord e.V. (Frisian Council) organizes a Frisian music contest
funded by the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media. Bands,
solo singers, choirs and other musicians may submit their songs until 15 January 2013.
The winners will be announced at a concert in autumn 2013. It is also planned to publish
a CD.

16
D. Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers
I. Recommendation 1
The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities adopt specific
legal provisions, where their absence hinders practical implementation of the
undertakings which Germany has entered into under the Charter.
Under the Act Ratifying the Language Charter of 9 July 1998, the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages in Germany has the status of federal law taking
precedence over subordinate law, including state legislation, and is to be applied as the
more specific law overriding other federal laws. This means that there are
comprehensive legal provisions in place ensuring compliance with the Charter at the
national level. The federal lawmaker has made sure, by virtue of these provisions, that
the undertakings which Germany has accepted are directly applicable on the judiciary
and the administration. No further legal provisions are needed to protect or promote
regional and minority languages.

II. Recommendation 2
The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities ensure that the
reduction of subsidies for private schools and cuts of the transport allowances will not
jeopardize the continued functioning of the Danish-language education at the current
level.
In 2011 and 2012, the state of Schleswig-Holstein cut funding for the Danish Schools
Association; that meant that the Danish school system faced slashes in funding. The
extensive Danish school system is especially important for preserving the Danish
language. For instance, approximately 5,700 pupils in Schleswig-Holstein attend primary
schools and Gemeinschaftsschulen (comprehensive schools) run by the Danish Schools
Association. Two Gemeinschaftsschulen have upper secondary levels in place. Also, the
Association runs a boarding school as an external branch of the Gemeinschaftsschulen.
During the negotiations surrounding the 2011 federal budget the Federal Government
decided, in November 2010, to earmark € 3.5 million for the Danish Schools Association.
In November 2011, the Budget Committee of the German Bundestag to set aside
another € 3.5 million for the Danish Schools Association in the 2012 budget. That meant
that repercussions of the budget cuts at the regional level were largely headed off, and
Danish-language education in Schleswig-Holstein was not at a vital threat. However, the
Christian-Paulsen-Skolen in Flensburg was closed down.
From 2007 to 2010, the Danisch Schools Association received the following amounts in
annual grants from the State Education Ministry:
2007: € 25.57 million (5,635 pupils)
2008: € 27.79 million (5,596 pupils)
2009: € 28,46 million (5,588 pupils)
2010: € 30,23million (5,568 pupils)
In 2011, the schools run by the Danish Schools Association received € 31.1 million in
grants, including the above-mentioned federal grant of € 3.5 million. The federal grant
largely made up for the cut in the regional budget. In 2012, the Danish schools received

17
€ 33.45 million, which meant that the grant - excluding the money set aside by the
Federal Government - was almost that paid out in 2010, and much higher than the sums
earmarked in 2008 and 2009, with the number of pupils being more or less the same.
As regards the problems associated with transport allowances cf. E. II. 1. a.

III. Recommendation 3
The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities adopt and
implement a structured policy for the promotion and preservation of North Frisian, Sater
Frisian and Lower Sorbian, including in particular measures which ensure as a matter of
urgency that primary and secondary education is systematically available in these
languages.
As regards a structured policy for the preservation of Lower Sorbian, Brandenburg
gives details in the chapter dealing with the individual undertakings.
In Lower Saxony the decree "Die Region und ihre Sprachen" (The Region and its
Languages) took effect on 1 August 2011, on the basis of which specific mandatory
subjects in primary education may be taught in the regional or minority language. As a
rule, subjects are taught bilingually, or using i.a. the immersion method.
The rules which apply to primary schools basically also apply to lower secondary schools
and may also be applied to optional compulsory courses or subjects (excluding foreign
languages).
Pupils wishing to attend classes in order to acquire or consolidate Low German or Sater
Frisian need to have the consent of their parents.
Meanwhile Lower Saxony's school authority has recruited 20 teachers for advisory work.
Schools conducting projects to implement Low German and/or Sater Frisian may
compensate the teachers for the time they spend on these special tasks and activities.
These projects include:


extended language encounter or language acquisition in the classroom,



the regular use of Low German and Sater Frisian in classroom instruction and in
daily school life,



regular participation in contests and conducting events also with external
organizers,



organizing music or drama working groups/projects outside normal classes,



organizing working groups/projects for specialized subjects addressing particular
aspects of the region or of the regional languages,



trying out the immersion method in various specialized subjects in primary or
lower secondary education,



conducting language courses taught also by lay teachers or external experts with
regional language skills,



proving that it makes sense to teach Low German/Sater Frisian as local
languages in addition to foreign languages,



making full reference to and use of the region and the regional languages in daily
school life and in the classroom.

18
Furthermore, schools may apply for the "Low German/Sater Frisian" label.
The decree "Friesisch an Schulen im Kreis Nordfriesland und auf Helgoland" (Frisian at
schools in the district of Nordfriesland and in Heligoland) was adopted on 2 October
2008. It forms the basis for teaching Frisian at schools in Schleswig-Holstein. It requires
schools in this language area to inform parents that they may enrol their children for
Frisian instruction. Frisian instruction will be offered if a suitable number (usually a
minimum of 12) pupils is available to form a class. Instruction may include pupils from
different grades and from different types of schools.
On top of supplementary Frisian instruction in primary education, Frisian may be offered
as an optional subject in grades five and six. Starting in grade seven, Frisian may be
offered in the framework of optional compulsory subjects.
At the upper secondary level, the minority language Frisian can be chosen as a
substitute for a foreign language, if sufficient staff is available. Attendance of Sater
Frisian lessons is voluntary.
Schools providing Frisian language instruction in Schleswig-Holstein are working hard to
place it on a broader footing in order to make it even more attractive and to make its
contents and results accessible to a broader public. The following may serve to illustrate
this approach: The reading competition "Lees frasch, freesk, fering, öömrang, sölring“, a
music competition, "Bjarnebiike" - a cultural event for children organized by schools in
Risum-Lindholm, the Christian-Feddersen Award of the students' competition organized
by the Nordfriisk Instituut, Christmas of Languages, Open House events with a Frisian
emphasis, Frisian reports for the Offener Kanal Westküste radio broadcasting station,
and Frisian film projects.

IV.

Recommendation 4

The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities ensure that the
provision of education in Upper Sorbian is not jeopardized by the changes in the
educational system concerning this language.
The school system in Saxony has been stable for many years. The School Regulations
governing individual types of schools have been adapted i.a. in order to increase
permeability between types of schools and to harmonize examinations. The changes
have benefited the provision of education in Upper Sorbian. The design, introduction and
evaluation of the 2plus strategy deserve particular mention here.

V. Recommendation 5
The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities upgrade the
teaching of Low German to the status of a regular school subject being taught as an
integral part of the curriculum and increase the number of hours devoted to Low
German, in the Länder concerned.
The governments of the states concerned have made the following comments in this
context:
Brandenburg does not intend to introduce Low German as a separate subject in
primary or secondary education owing to the low number of pupils interested in learning
the language.

19
In the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, Low German is part of the overall curricula for
primary education and part of German education in secondary schools. The focus is on
Low German as a cultural asset and on structural particularities (comparing Low German
and English). Regional variants and particularities are also addressed. The teaching
details are left to the schools.
In 2010, the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg introduced Low German as a regular
subject with a separate curriculum, allocating approved subject hours. The classes,
which are geared to language acquisition, are offered in the rural regions of
Finkenwerder, Neuenfelde, Cranz, Vier- and Marschlande, which form part of the Low
German linguistic landscape.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Low German is taught in German classes. This
approach has proved successful in implementing the schools' legal mandate to promote
Low German. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is not planning to introduce Low
German as a separate subject.
Lower Saxony refers to its reply regarding Recommendation No. 3 in Chapter D,
Section III; furthermore, before taking a decision on introducing Low German as an
additional subject, Lower Saxony wishes to analyse the language acquisition possibilities
in regular classes granted under the decree.
In the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia, the use of Low German in everyday life has
decreased compared with the previous reporting period. A school trial is to be launched
to find out whether this trend can be stopped by administrative action. Cf. the comments
regarding Chapter E, paragraph 2.a.
Saxony-Anhalt has signed Part II of the Language Charter and feels particularly
committed to meeting the arising obligations. The aim is to prepare - and where possible
put into practice - targeted language acquisition measures already for nursery schools.
For several years, working groups have been offered at schools, regrettably with little
resonance. At the beginning of the 2011/2012 school year, there were 26 Low German
working groups at 25 schools, attended by 221 students. These figures are not
satisfactory. For this reason, Saxony-Anhalt is seeking to provide more offers and attract
more pupils.
Schleswig-Holstein's state government is not planning to make Low German a regular
subject and finds the number of school hours allocated to Low German sufficient.

VI.

Recommendation 6

The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities ensure that an
effective monitoring mechanism exists in the field of education for all regional or minority
languages covered under Part III.
The Committee of Experts acknowledged, in its latest reports, that existing administrative
structures could be used to monitor regional or minority language education. The
education ministries at state level and the supervisory school authorities monitor the
measures taken to increase regional and minority language instruction. Furthermore,
Germany regularly reports back to the Council of Europe with regard to the measures
taken in the field of education. In addition, the governments of Saxony and SchleswigHolstein regularly report to their parliaments concerning the situation of the minorities
within their states and their languages. The reports themselves are made public.
Furthermore, there is parliamentary control in place in every state: The state

20
governments need to reply to all parliamentary enquiries. Germany does not
acknowledge the need for further reporting requirements. From the German point of
view, Article 8 (1) (i) of the Language Charter cannot be construed to mean that a central
body needs to be set up. It would not be in line with the federal structure provided by the
German constitution to have a central mechanism in place to control the states with
regard to education. Also, such a mechanism would bring undesirable effects: further
bureaucracy and extra costs.

VII.

Recommendation 7

The Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities take resolute
action to establish a structured policy for making it practically possible to use regional or
minority languages in dealings with the administration and, where relevant, in the courts.
Initially, it should be noted that the law applicable in the Federal Republic of Germany is
fully in line with the obligations arising from the Language Charter.
As regards Danish, North Frisian, Sater Frisian and Low German, Germany has
undertaken to make the submission of certificates and evidence in the above-mentioned
regional or minority languages permissible in civil procedures as well as in administrative
court proceedings, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations. Furthermore
it is not permissible to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within Germany
solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority language.
It is true that, according to Section 184 first sentence of the Judicature Act
(Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz, GVG), the official language in court is German. However,
based on the constitutional right to a fair trial (Article 2 (1), Article 20 (3) of the Basic
Law), the right to a legal hearing (Article 103 (1) of the Basic Law) and the right of
recourse to the courts (Article 19 (4), Article 20 (3) of the Basic Law), the courts are
obligated to take into account statements by persons involved in proceedings which are
in a foreign language, including documents and evidence in a foreign language.
It is merely for Lower and Upper Sorbian that the Federal Republic of Germany took on
further reaching obligations. The right of the Sorbs to speak Sorbian in court in their
areas of settlement is guaranteed in line with Section 184 second sentence of the
Judicature Act. This means that the requirements are met also with regard to Lower and
Upper Sorbian.
It would be up to the states to establish a structured policy for making it practically
possible to use regional or minority languages in dealings with the administration and,
where relevant, in the courts.
The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen does not consider it necessary to take measures
to establish such a policy. The authorities are not aware of any cases where Low
German could not be used owing to practical obstacles to be removed in this manner.
In Lower Saxony Low German and Sater Frisian can be used in dealings with the
administration and in the courts in line with the Charter. The general use of these two
languages concern above all the dealings with local authorities. This is illustrated by the
possibility of conducting marriage ceremonies in Low German/Sater Frisian or of
submitting certificates in Low German/Sater Frisian.

21
North Rhine-Westphalia has not taken any measures to establish a structured policy
for making it practically possible to use regional or minority languages in the courts, and
does not intend to do so because it feels there is no practical need for it.

VIII.

Recommendation 8

Finally, the Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities take
measures so that adequate radio and television broadcasting are available in Danish,
Low German, Lower Sorbian, North Frisian, Romani, and Sater Frisian.
Owing to the freedom of broadcasting and the freedom of the press guaranteed by the
German constitution it is not possible to interfere in or determine the programming by
providers. All the authorities can do is encourage the broadcasting institutions to make
sure that their programmes reflect regional and minority languages in an adequate
manner. Neither the federal nor the state authorities are in a position to exercise
coercive measures.
In July 2012 the parliament of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen adopted the Media
Act amending i.a. the diversity requirements on private broadcasters. The new
Section 13 (3) calls on broadcasters to include an appropriate amount of broadcasts in
Low German in their programmes.
In addition, the Senate of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen concluded a framework
agreement with the German Sinti and Roma Association of Bremen on 17 July 2012,
calling on the public service broadcasters and the state media authority to include the
particular concerns of Sinti and Roma in their programmes. Furthermore, the Senate
confirms that it supports the use of the Offener Kanal radio broadcasting station to give
the German Sinti and Roma a higher profile.
Within his constitutional powers, the then Minister-President of Lower Saxony sent a
letter to media professionals in September 2009 to acknowledge the efforts they
undertook to promote the use of Low German in the media. He also called on them to
continue and step up these efforts, saying that the regional language identity could make
a major contribution to cultural and social diversity. Furthermore, in June 2010, he visited
the citizens’ radio station Ems-Vechte-Welle as part of his 2010 summer tour - attracting
a great deal of media attention.
The government of Lower Saxony amended the Lower Saxony Media Act
(Niedersächsisches Mediengesetz, NMedienG), thereby documenting its commitment to
the adequate representation of regional and minority languages. The amendment was
adopted by Lower Saxony's parliament in 2010. Section 15 (2), second sentence, of the
Media Act requires broadcasters to include the regional and minority languages used in
the coverage area in an adequate manner.
With regard to North Rhine-Westphalia it should be noted that Low German is only
spoken in certain parts and that its use in everyday life continues to decrease. Therefore
it is difficult to produce programmes in Low German. However, the Westdeutscher
Rundfunk (WDR) broadcasting station and the Media Centre of the regional local
authority Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe have entered into negotiations about
opening the large WDR audio archive up to the interested public. The idea is to produce
a CD covering the most important radio play and feature productions of 60 years. Most
of the rather complex legal issues surrounding the project have already been solved, the
Media Centre stated.

22
With regard to the private sector it should be noted that some regional newspapers have
resumed giving a higher profile to Low German in their productions by re-introducing
Low German columns. For instance, the "Westfälische Nachrichten" newspaper, the
biggest newspaper in the Münsterland region, publishes a commentary in Low German
every Saturday, which is also made available in the audio version on the newspaper's
website. Also, websites providing Low German content have been linked to the
homepage of the Westphalia association in Münster - an offer appreciated by many
users according to the clickstream analysis.
Saxony-Anhalt's Ministry of Culture invited a representative of the Magdeburg centre of
Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) broadcasting station to take part in meetings of the
"Low German" Working Group, which was set up at state level approximately ten years
ago. The reasons for doing so had been discussed in previous meetings. Unfortunately,
the invitation has not been acted upon so far. Saxony-Anhalt will continue in its efforts.
At the latest meeting of the "Low German" Working Group it was suggested to introduce
a radio church service in Low German to be broadcast by the MDR's culture radio
programme "Figaro".
Schleswig-Holstein has very limited possibilities to provide financial incentives to
increase the provision of the Low German regional language and minority languages.
With regard to the representation of these languages in Schleswig-Holstein, reference is
made to the below-mentioned statements concerning the recommendations.
Furthermore, Schleswig-Holstein's government decided, in October 2012, to second the
Minister-President’s Commissioner for National Minorities and Ethnic Groups, Border
Area Work and Low German to the Broadcasting Board of the Deutschlandfunk
broadcasting station, in an effort to give the concerns of minorities and ethnic groups a
higher profile in public service broadcasting institutions.

23
E. The Committee of Experts' evaluations
I. Evaluations with respect to Part II of the Charter
1. Article 7 (1) (c)
a. Upper Sorbian
In its last report the Committee of Experts asked the Saxony authorities to provide it with
further information in the next State Report on the strategy to encourage the use of
Sorbian in public life (Nos. 34–36).
The above-mentioned strategy was presented by the Saxony State Ministry of Science
and the Arts at a Cabinet meeting on 24 April 2012 as a set of measures to encourage
and revive the use of the Sorbian language. This mandate was formulated in the
coalition agreement forming the state government for the fifth legislative session of the
Saxony State Parliament. It states that "Sorbian language and culture shall continue to
receive significant funding. The Sorbian language is indispensable for strengthening and
ensuring Sorbian everyday life."
The measures are based on proposals from participating ministries in Saxony's state
government, from the commissioners for Sorbian affairs from the rural districts of
Bautzen and Görlitz, from Domowina – Bund Lausitzer Sorben e.V. and from the Section
for Sorbian Matters at the Saxony State Ministry of Science and the Arts. The plan calls
for measures to promote the acquisition of the Sorbian language, increase its use in
public life and to impart knowledge about the Sorbian language and culture. Some of
these measures are already being implemented, while others require more detailed
specification and greater awareness among possible partners.
The set of measures is published on the website of the Saxony State Ministry of
Scientific Affairs and Arts at www.sorben.sachsen.de/.

b. Low German
In its last report, the Committee of Experts suggested to the German authorities that they
should include in their next State Report information on specific measures taken to
increase the use of Low German in education, including universities (Nos. 37–38).
In the state of Brandenburg, Low German is offered in the form of activity groups at
some primary schools (Grundschulen) in the northern school districts of Eberswalde and
Perleberg. As the name indicates, these are not language courses, but a service offered
by the school in which pupils may take part voluntarily. Low German activity groups are
not based on framework curricula, nor is performance graded on the same basis that
applies to classroom work. Activities may be led by teachers or non-school personnel
(parents, clubs, native speakers, etc.).
In the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, there were no additional measures to promote
the use of Low German at the University of Bremen beyond the cooperation agreement
between the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (Institute for the Low German
language) and the University of Bremen as mentioned in the last State Report. Bremen
also refers to its comments in Chapter E. II. 6. Low German in the Free Hanseatic City of
Bremen

24
The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg refers to its comments in Chapter E. II. 7.
Low German in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.
The state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania refers to the comments in Chapter E. II.
8. Low German in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
The state of Lower Saxony refers to its comments on Recommendation 3 in Chapter D.
III and adds that the decree "Die Region und ihre Sprachen im Unterricht" (The region
and its languages in the classroom) made the following binding effective 1 August 2011,
in addition to rules on language acquisition:
Schools that render outstanding and long-term services to Low German and Sater
Frisian, i.e. not only language encounter but also acquisition as part of their school
mission, can be given the title of a Low German or Sater Frisian school.
The school authority of Lower Saxony has allotted 265 teaching hours to advising and
support (as at 1 February 2012). In addition to advising schools and expert conferences,
advisers for Low German and Sater Frisian are also responsible for helping with regional
and state competitions, initiating and organizing regional expert networks for Low
German and continuing professional education, maintaining contacts with the regional
associations (Landschaften and Landschaftsverbänden) and conducting public
information efforts.
When hiring teaching staff, it is now possible to specify knowledge of Low German/Sater
Frisian as an additional qualification in addition to the subjects to be taught. The Lower
Saxony school authority is called on to advise schools accordingly and advertise open
teaching positions with this additional qualification.
A supervisory body monitors how Lower Saxony is meeting the education-related
requirements set by the Charter. This body is made up of representatives from the state
administration, the regional associations and the Niedersächsischer Heimatbund.
Monitoring is based on the report of the Lower Saxony school authority, which provides
information on the activities of the advisers, on how the allotted teaching hours are used
and on measures to promote the regional and the minority language as intended by the
Charter over the previous year.
In July 2012, Lower Saxony's State Ministry of Education and the Ostfriesische
Landschaft agreed to cooperate on an education project for the acquisition of the
regional language Low German and the minority language Sater Frisian as early second
languages. The aims are to draw up guides for competence-oriented multilingual
instruction on the model of Low German and Sater Frisian (work on curricula), to develop
curriculum for language immersion in Low German/Sater Frisian in primary schools
(work on curricula), to introduce and/or expand language immersion in order to facilitate
language acquisition, to increase and intensify Low German offerings in schools, and to
draw up high-quality, certifiable advanced training for (primary school) teachers in Low
German and Sater Frisian.
Since 2009, advanced training courses have been offered on the basis of the core
curriculum which take into account both language encounter and language acquisition.
These courses are in two parts and are aimed above all at primary school teaching staff
with little or no knowledge of Low German. Average enrolment for the courses is about
35 participants.

25
At the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, the university chair in Germanic
linguistics: Linguistic pragmatics and sociolinguistics/Low German was temporarily filled
from 16 December 2007 until 15 December 2012. The position was initially limited to five
years. In the meantime, the process of making the position permanent was initiated and
completed in September 2012. In 2012, state funding for the University of Oldenburg to
strengthen Low German increased by € 100,000; starting in 2013, funding will increase
by € 150,000 every year. As a result, the university advertised a permanent half-time
position for a research assistant and a permanent half-time position for a lecturer for
special tasks. In addition, a temporary half-time position for a lecturer for special tasks
was made permanent.
Over the past three and a half years, various types of Low German and Sater Frisian
courses were tested. The courses given under the auspices of the university chair
focused on linking Low German and Sater Frisian issues with topics of general relevance
for education in the field of German. The testing phase ended in the 2012 summer
semester. To follow up, a study programme is to be developed from the existing building
blocks which will allow every group of students to participate in these specialized studies
with various areas of concentration during the bachelor programme. The master
programme of study has so far been oriented towards students majoring in the subject
and those training to become teachers at Gymnasium (grammar school). Planned
reforms of other degrees will lead to expanding the master programme course offerings.
Every semester, practical Low German language courses have been offered for
beginners and advanced learners consisting of four hours of instruction per week, with
an expanded course offered once a year. Course instruction is based on the levels of the
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
A certificate in Low German was introduced with the start of the specialized studies; it
requires successfully completing specialized courses, practical language exercises and
a final thesis on some aspect of Low German. This certificate is likely to become
increasingly relevant for hiring at schools in Lower Saxony which are striving for a higher
profile in the field of Low German. The specialized studies are striving to establish a
programme of advanced training for teachers at the University of Oldenburg. At the
state's initiative, a certified training programme is to be developed in Oldenburg, to be
carried out with the help of external instructors and with the support of the specialized
studies. The main task of the specialized studies will be to work with experts from
schools and regional associations and in consultation with the state's school authority to
develop curriculum initially for primary school teachers, followed by curriculum for other
groups of teachers, which satisfies the requirements for certification. Additional plans
include developing a series of textbooks for teaching Low German in primary and
secondary schools, initially for a selected language region and later for other language
regions.
A research group applied for funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) for a
project on Low German in northern Lower Saxony and Westphalia.
The project aims to develop a standard process for lay persons to collect audio
recordings in the region Bersenbrücker Land and is intended to serve as a model for
other projects in other Low German language regions. The resulting archive of audio
recordings is intended not only to add to current stocks of dialect recordings, but also to
be available for use in university courses and as a resource for final theses and to
enable concrete implementation of "language encounters" with Low German at school as

26
required in the core curriculum. With this in mind, the recordings will be available on the
Internet and a guide for teachers in various types of schools will be developed. Nearly
complete data files of 77 speakers from 16 different sites are already available. Further,
selected data from the 16 sites can be accessed using an interactive map that can be
found at www.niederdeutsch.uni-oldenburg.de/55984.html. This map is regularly
updated.
A significant proportion of research resources was dedicated to the project "Intonation in
varieties of Dutch", begun at the University of Nijmegen in 2006 by the Dutch
Organization for Scientific Research; after its move to Oldenburg, this project was
expanded to include the town of Weener in Ostfriesland in order to capture the Low
German and local High German in this region.
With its concentrations in Low German and Sater Frisian, the University of Oldenburg
serves as a partner for the following projects as well, in which aspects of language
promotion, language protection and cultural work predominate:
 Low German–High German online dictionary for Ostfriesland (cooperation
project between the university and the Ostfriesische Landschaft)
 Immersion courses at the Gymnasium Warstade-Hemmoor (external
dissertation project)
 Low German in Lower Saxony (cooperation with the tourism marketing firm
TourismusMarketing Niedersachsen GmbH (TMN), Hanover)
The major goals for the next few years include:


Stabilizing student demand for specialized studies in Low German at the level
attained in the bachelor programme and gradually increasing demand in the
master programme



Establishing a certified programme in Low German for advanced teacher training
at the University of Oldenburg



Increasing research output in the field of Low German, Sater Frisian and High
German. In recent years, the focus has been on building up the specialized
studies programme and creating a regional network. Expanding research into
Low German and Sater Frisian is viewed as one of the most important tasks for
the coming years. It is also related to the goal of strengthening Low German as a
subject of university study. First, research on the Low German foundations of
High German in terms of phonetics, phonology and prosody is intended to help
strengthen the role of Low German in the study of German language and
literature. Second, experimental research in these areas is intended to raise the
profile of Low German in the international research community.

The NHL Hogeschool Leeuwarden is a leader in training teachers for multilingual
instruction in Dutch, Frisian and English at schools in the Dutch province of Friesland. In
2011, instructors at the Instituut Educatie en Communicatie, Afdeling Talen, agreed on
joint school-oriented courses in the field of Low German, Sater Frisian and West Frisian.
The state of North Rhine-Westphalia reports that the Low German competitions for
primary school pupils continue to be very important for the schools in the Münsterland.
These competitions are usually held every two years in the rural areas of the

27
Münsterland administrative district under the auspices of the state programme for culture
and schools.
In Münster, a new official for the preservation of local culture developed a model for
experienced teachers and artists who are speakers of Low German to offer activities for
schools. With support from the district government, this project has been carried out in
Münster's primary schools and has been recommended to its secondary schools.
In addition, the guide on Low German in the classroom is to be revised in coordination
with the initiative on regional projects for Low German. In coordination with the regional
agency, Low German texts, conversations and documents are to be published as
multimedia on the Internet to offer an occasion for children, young people and adults to
speak and work with the language.
See the comments on Chapter I. 1.2.a regarding a planned school pilot project.
With regard to university education and training, it should be noted that in North RhineWestphalia, the post of professor for Low German at the University of Münster was
upgraded to the level of W-2. Professor Spiekermann began his work in summer
semester 2012 with a concentration on Low German. As a result, it is once again
possible to complete doctoral and post-doctoral (Habilitation) studies in Low German at
Münster. The following activities in the Low German language and literature section
during the reporting period should be mentioned: the project "Mittelniederdeutsches
Glossarienkorpus", which aims to collect and publish the terminology preserved in Latin–
Middle Low German and Middle Low German–Latin vocabulary manuscripts of the late
Middle Ages; and an atlas of early Middle Low German written languages, which will
display the regional Low German written languages of the 14th century in cartographic
form. A new project on Low German in Westphalia is creating a digital text archive of
medieval documents, chronicles, inscriptions and religious literature.
In conjunction with the commemoration of the 150th birthday of Augustin Wibbelt,
probably the most important writer in Münsterland Low German, in 2012, the University
of Münster and the Augustin Wibbelt Society planned a campaign for schools and
cultural associations across Westphalia.
At the University of Bielefeld's Department of Linguistics and Literature, Professor
Seelbach is temporarily continuing the activities of Professor Wirrer, who has retired.
Until December 2012, Professor Wirrer also supervised the research project on
language variations in northern Germany and Low German, which was in its final phase.
The joint project with the University of Münster, "Niederdeutsch in Westfalen.
Historisches Digitales Textarchiv" (Low German in Westphalia: A historical digital text
archive) has been under way since 2009 and is continuing successfully at both locations;
during the reporting period, it received funding from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
and the Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe. The project "Repertorium der
mittelalterlichen Autoritäten" has been completed and all Low German texts are now
accessible. At the University of Bielefeld, bachelor and master theses are drawing
connections between writings in dialect by authors of a particular region and texts from
the 15th and 16th centuries. Classes on Middle Low German are given regularly. Quality
improvement funds from North Rhine-Westphalia are to be used to add Low German
language classes to German department course offerings. Lastly, cooperation was
recently established with the University of Tallinn on topics of Low German language and
literature in Reval (17th-century journals and writings in dialect).

28
In 2010, Professor Tophinke was hired as the chair for German and General Language
Studies at the University of Paderborn. Professor Tophinke has applied for DFG funding
for a project on Low German syntax. At the same time, a lectureship in Low German was
established starting in winter semester 2011/12; the post is held by Dr Nagel of Münster.
All three universities continue to offer lectures and seminars on Low German, which
have found an interested audience even among non-specialists. For example, the
University of Münster is involved in the cross-cutting project on language variations in
northern Germany. Several studies of actual language praxis in Westphalia are currently
under way.
In the field of cultural education, Low German theatre activity in the reporting area has
increased over the past two years. According to the Fachstelle Niederdeutsch of the
Westfälischer Heimatbund, there are about 200 theatre companies in Westphalia. These
local theatres are independently managed and financed and currently offer the broadest
opportunity to learn, speak and perform in Low German. Happily, the Low German
theatres enjoy surprisingly large audiences, are very popular with the local population
and often offer outstanding results.
The Low German theatre company of Münster, which stands out from the many
independently managed and financed theatre companies, had its production of the Low
German play Spiells van Dr. Faustus from the 2006/07 season professionally recorded
and produced a DVD; North Rhine-Westphalia contributed € 3,000 towards the
production costs. This linguistically valuable production is available in particular to
schools in the Westmünsterland region.
A "regional" entitled "Zukunftsland Westmünsterland" (Westmünsterland: Land of the
future) will be held in 2015/16. Representatives of participating institutions are to present
a language project for qualification which attempts to follow the phenomena of Low
German in the district.
At the initiative of the Münster district government, it was possible in autumn 2011 for the
first time to bring together all institutions working in the field of Low German to produce a
cultural programme for the joint federal–state meeting of desk officers in April 2012. The
programme was advertised throughout the Münsterland region, attracted large
audiences and received a great deal of media attention.
Also deserving of mention are numerous research activities of the Westphalia
commission for dialect and name research (Kommission für Mundart und
Namensforschung Westfalens), an institution devoted to documenting and researching
Low German in the region Westfalen-Lippe and based at the Landschaftsverband
Westfalen-Lippe.
In the state of Saxony-Anhalt, a course on early childhood acquisition of Low German
was offered both winter and summer semesters from 2010 to 2012 as a module of the
bachelor programme in cultural studies/German. During the course, students developed
projects to promote early childhood acquisition of Low German (course materials,
instructional games, picture books, etc.) that were used in selected nursery schools and
primary schools.
In the master programme in culture, transfer and intermediality, the optional compulsory
module on Low German between oral and written language that was announced in the
state's previous comments has now been completed.

29
Together with the Landesheimatbund, the Arbeitsstelle Niederdeutsch (office for Low
German) at the Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg regularly offers advanced
training in Low German for teaching and child-care staff.
In 2010, the text Unsere plattdeutsche Fibel - Wir lernen Plattdeutsch in Sachsen-Anhalt
1. – 6. Schuljahr (Our Low German primer: Low German in Saxony-Anhalt for grades 1
through 6) was revised; the Landesheimatbund has so far delivered complete classroom
sets to 41 schools by request.
The state is funding a project of the Landesheimatbund on early childhood education in
the field of Low German which was conducted in close cooperation with the Arbeitsstelle
Niederdeutsch in 2011 and 2012. Two advanced teacher training courses on this topic
were carried out in 2012 and a CD of teaching materials was produced.
Advanced training courses on this topic were offered at the University of Magdeburg in
2010 and 2011 for primary school teachers and child-care staff.
In 2010, 37 schools took part in the annual competition for reading Low German aloud
("Schülerinnen und Schüler lesen PLATT"), which is funded by the Ostdeutsche
Sparkassenverband and sponsored by the state education minister of Saxony-Anhalt; in
2011, 33 schools participated. In 2011, a new brochure for the competition was drafted
and printed, with child-friendly texts.
Additional events in the field of education:


2011: Low German theatre competition for children



2011: Low German theatre workshop for children and youth, sponsored by the
Landesheimatbund and carried out in cooperation with the Puppentheater
Magdeburg



2012: Low German theatre competition for children



2012: Low German project day held at a Magdeburg primary school.

In the state of Schleswig-Holstein, the decree "Niederdeutsch in der Schule" states that
Low German is the teaching principle in all schools in Schleswig-Holstein. It also
provides for the possibility of setting up activity groups. Although this does not make Low
German an independent subject of study, schools are obligated to teach about Low
German language and culture.
The Schleswig-Holstein state government continues to make every effort to increase the
use of Low German in the education sector. Specific measures taken in 2012 to
strengthen and promote Low German:


Model school in the field of Low German

From 1 August 2012, the regional school in Niebüll, Nordfriesland, is the first model
school for Low German in Schleswig-Holstein. It receives extra funding from the state
government to develop courses and for documentation, advanced training and research
support.
Language acquisition is the primary focus of instruction in Niebüll. The competences of
the University of Flensburg and the Low German centres in Schleswig-Holstein are used
for support, as is the expert counsel of the Institute for Low German.

30
The aim of this model project is to share the expertise developed in Niebüll with other
schools in Schleswig-Holstein in order to strengthen Low German in the educational
sector.


"Plattdüütsch-Emmi"

The state parliament of Schleswig-Holstein, the State Ministry of Education and
Research and the Schleswig-Holstein Heimatbund have together initiated a new prize to
promote Low German in day-care centres, schools, higher education and youth groups,
the "Emmi för Plattdüütsch in Sleswig-Holsteen".
It takes the place of the Niederdeutsche Schul-Siegel and "Do mol wat op Platt" awards.
Together with the State Minister of Education and Research and the Schleswig-Holstein
Heimatbund, the president of the state parliament awards the prize once a year.
The Low German section is located within the Institute for German at the University of
Flensburg. All German majors must take an introduction to Low German or Frisian in
their first semester. In their third year of study, German majors may choose a
concentration in Low German: In this concentration they can deepen their knowledge of
Low German in two modules (six classes). In addition to a regular bachelor of arts in
German, the university also awards a Low German certificate to those who successfully
complete both modules. Classes in the Low German concentration are also open to
German majors who have not chosen this concentration. Students are regularly informed
during classes and office hours and at information events about classes in Low German.
In June 2012, the University of Flensburg was awarded an "Emmi för Plattdüütsch in
Sleswig-Holsteen" on the basis of the successful bachelor thesis by a student in the Low
German concentration.
There are three instructors for the Low German section. In winter semester 2012/2013
the University of Flensburg is offering ten classes in Low German. For winter semester
2013/2014, the university is revising its teacher training courses in line with the types of
schools in Schleswig-Holstein (Grundschule, Regionalschule and Gemeinschaftsschule)
and expanding its master programme from two semesters to four. In this context, the
university is examining whether to lend even greater weight to the Low German
concentration.
Low German (chair for German philology, in particular Low German language and
literature) is firmly anchored within the department of German language and literature at
the Christian Albrechts University of Kiel (CAU). In a number of bachelor and master
programme modules, German majors can choose classes with an emphasis on Low
German. Further, majors of German and other subjects who are not studying to be
teachers can choose modules having a Low German focus in order to gain additional
qualifications in Low German philology. Majors in all departments who are studying to be
teachers may take Low German as an additional subject during or after their teacher
training.
Students in the master of arts programme in German now also have the option to
choose a concentration in Low German. University of Kiel students are regularly
informed about all these options via special information events, in class and during
instructors' office hours. In winter semester 2012/2013, the university is offering 13
classes related to Low German.

31
Further, the Low German section of the University of Kiel's German department entered
into a cooperation agreement with its counterpart at the University of Flensburg. Under
this cooperation agreement, the two universities can exchange Low German instructors,
and students of each university can take Low German classes at the other institution for
credit. The two universities coordinate their semester offerings in Low German.
The University of Kiel offers two courses in Low German, which are also open to
students from other departments. This option is available through the module "Low
German language acquisition", which offers two courses, Low German for beginners
("Wi lehrt Platt") and for advanced learners ("Nedderdüütsch in’n Düütschünnerricht").
Students who have not registered for the teacher training course in the additional subject
area may take these classes by permission if space permits.
The Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities of Schleswig-Holstein to review
the plans for a complete discontinuation of the support for the Institut für Niederdeutsche
Sprache (No. 39).
While negotiating the budgets for 2011/12 and the mandatory budget cuts, the state
government examined the possibility of cutting all state funding for the Institut für
Niederdeutsche Sprache. When it announced its decision to end its funding, the state
government assumed that its only option was to terminate its agreement to provide
funding.
Following successful negotiations based on Article 6 (2) of that agreement with the aim
of revising the operating plan for the further funding of the Institute for Low German, the
termination of the agreement was reversed. The subsidies for the institute are being
reduced starting in 2012, so the state can reduce its financial contribution. In this way,
Schleswig-Holstein will continue to be a member of the institute.
At the same time, the state government and the Low German Council of the SchleswigHolstein state parliament asked the states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt to provide financial support to
the Institute for Low German.

2. Article 7 (1) (f)
a. Low German
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts advised the authorities of Saxony-Anhalt,
Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia to offer Low German on a voluntary basis at
preschools and as a regular elective in its own right at primary and secondary schools,
and to ensure sufficient basic and further training for teachers (Nos. 45–46).
With regard to Low German at primary schools, Brandenburg refers to the comments
on Article 7 (1) (c). In addition, it is noted that in Brandenburg the education offices, with
their advisers in the framework of the regional structure of further training for teachers,
have the option of organizing and carrying out events as needed and if persons with the
necessary language skills are present. If external training providers can offer courses,
they may be recognized as advanced teacher training.
North Rhine-Westphalia's Ministry for Schools and Continuing Education is currently
reviewing the possibility of conducting a school pilot project in Low German. This project,
initially limited to five years, would be carried out at six to ten primary schools, building
on the German core curriculum investigating language and language use as part of the

32
originary instruction. At the moment, the usual questions that arise before launching a
school pilot project need to be dealt with, for example concerning the didactic
programme, advanced training for teachers, project coordination, cooperation with
school and non-school partners (universities, publishers) and financing. In the medium
term, the pilot project would serve to assess whether it is possible to create a separate
subject of study in Low German that could be continued to the lower secondary level. It
should be noted that North Rhine-Westphalia has no preschools as such.
The state of Saxony-Anhalt also refers to its efforts to meet the obligations from Part II
of the Language Charter; these efforts were already described in the response to
Recommendation 5 of the Council of Ministers. The rest of the measures described in
detail with regard to Article 7 (1) (c) demonstrate the diverse activities the state has
undertaken to advance the teaching of Low German at preschools and primary schools.
At the same time, the Committee of Experts called on the Lower Saxony authorities to
develop a structured policy intended to improve the state of Low German education in
primary and secondary schools (No. 47).
Lower Saxony refers to its comments on Article 7 (1) (c) in Chapter E. I. 1. b.

b. Sater Frisian
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the German authorities to take the
necessary structural measures, in particular in the field of teacher training, to ensure the
sustainabilityof bilingual education in nursery schools and primary schools in Saterland
(Nos. 48–49).
Lower Saxony explains that one of the schools participating in the project on early
bilingualism is a primary school in Saterland; as a result, primary school children in
Saterland have been learning Sater Frisian since January 2012.
In August 2011, the University of Oldenburg submitted an application to the DFG for an
initial project on language contact between Sater Frisian, Low German and High German
in Saterland; this application was approved in March 2012.
With its concentrations in Low German and Sater Frisian, the University of Oldenburg
serves as a partner for the following projects as well, in which aspects of language
promotion, language protection and cultural work predominate:


Saterland as a model region for early bilingualism (project in cooperation with the
Oldenburgische Landschaft and the Ostfriesische Landschaft)



Completion of the dictionary of Sater Frisian (with state funding)



Sater Frisian language course (support for a native speaker of Sater Frisian in
developing a textbook in cooperation with the Oldenburgische Landschaft).

3. Article 7 (4)
a. Romani
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the German authorities to take
into consideration, in the promotion of Romani, the needs and wishes expressed by all
relevant groups which use Romani in Germany (Nos. 56–58).
The state government of North Rhine-Westphalia continues to fund the Counselling
Bureau for Sinti and Roma, which advises members of the minority, mediates between

33
the minority, majority and their institutions, and also promotes school and extra-curricular
education, among other things. To supplement the Bureau's efforts, since January 2012
the North Rhine-Westphalia State Ministry of Labour, Integration and Social Affairs has
provided funding for a social worker in Wuppertal, who advises and assists children,
young people and families in Romani on behalf of the social Counselling Bureau of the
state association. The Sinti Alliance in North Rhine-Westphalia has not requested any
financial support, so the state has not worked with the Alliance in recent years.
The state of Rhineland-Palatinate continues to provide funding to the Association of
German Sinti and Roma in Rhineland-Palatinate, reg'd society (member of the Central
Council of German Sinti and Roma) and the Sinti Union of Rhineland-Palatinate, reg'd
society (member of the Sinti Alliance of Germany, reg'd society).
The Association of German Sinti and Roma in Schleswig-Holstein, reg'd society, which
does not belong to any umbrella organization and equally represents the interests of all
Sinti and Roma in Schleswig-Holstein.

34

II. Evaluations with respect to Part III of the Charter
1. Danish in Schleswig-Holstein
a. Article 8
In its latest report the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
ensure that the foreseen budgetary cuts of the state of Schleswig-Holstein do not
jeopardize the current level of provision of Danish-language education. (Nos. 61 - 65). It
also called on the authorities to find a long-term solution to the problems associated with
transport allowances for pupils attending Danish schools (Nos. 66 - 67).
Reference is made to Recommendation 2 of the Committee of Ministers.
In the years 2009 to 2011, Schleswig-Holstein reimbursed the districts of SchleswigFlensburg, Nordfriesland and Rendsburg-Eckernförde for half of the costs they had
voluntarily paid to the Danish Schools Association in transport allowances for 2008,
2009 and 2010. The total amount of € 1.1 million was paid. The governing coalition
parties - Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD, Social Democratic Party of
Germany), Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance 90/The Greens) and Südschleswigscher
Wählerverband (SSW, South Schleswig Voters' Association) - stated the following in
their coalition agreement:
"In 2012, the state government will look into how Section 114 of the Schools Act can be
amended to cover allowances for the transport of pupils to schools of the Danish
minority, in an effort to establish the equality of Danish minority schools and public
schools."
Section 114 of the Schools Act regulates the transport of pupils to publicly maintained
schools as an obligatory task incumbent on (local) school providers.

b. Article 10 (1) (a) (v)
In its latest report the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
ensure that documents in Danish can be submitted to administrative authorities in
practice (Nos. 74 - 76).
With reference to the previous reports, the government of Schleswig-Holstein regards
the obligation under Article 10 (1) (a) (v) of the Charter as fulfilled. As required by the
Charter, users of Danish may validly submit a document in Danish with a German
translation. However, the state government will hold specific talks with respect to this
issue in the first six months of 2013, as requested by the Danish minority.

c. Article 11 (1) (b) (ii) and (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in Danish on a
regular and sufficient basis (Nos. 77 – 83).
According to their coalition agreement covering the period of 2012 - 2017, the governing
coalition parties at state level - Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD, Social
Democratic Party of Germany), Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance 90/The Greens) and
Südschleswigscher Wählerverband (SSW, South Schleswig Voters' Association) - are
planning to argue with vigour in the bodies of the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)

35
broadcasting station to make sure that public service broadcasting reflects the linguistic
and cultural diversity prevailing in Schleswig-Holstein.
Reporting on the Danish minority on NDR 1 Welle Nord regularly includes news and
reports on current events, extensive features in the programme “Von Binnenland und
Waterkant” (From inland and the water’s edge) and one-hour productions on special
occasions. In this context, parts of interviews are frequently broadcast in Danish; they
are previously translated and explained but not voiced over.
The Danish town of Sønderborg launched a bid to become the 2017 European capital of
culture; the underlying concept also involved districts in Schleswig-Holstein and the town
of Flensburg. On this occasion, journalists of NDR 1 Welle Nord and the Danish Radio
P4 Syd broadcasting station produced a one-hour German-Danish radio feature, which
was broadcast on NDR 1 Welle Nord in August 2012 as part of the "Ostseemagazin" - a
programme concerning issues in the Baltic Sea states.
Europe's largest bridge, the Fehmarn belt link, is bound to make the cooperation
between the NDR and their Danish counterparts even closer. There already is joint
research into how this bridge will change the lives of those on either side of the belt. The
results will be exchanged and fed into the radio and television coverage.
The NDR broadcasting studio in Flensburg deserves particular mention with regard to
German-Danish cooperation. Close cross-border contact with Danish colleagues makes
sure that Danish and/or cross-border issues are regularly covered by the programmes
“SH-Magazin” and “SH 18:00”. The German-Danish cooperation and the mutual news
coverage serve the understanding between Germans and Danes and their recognized
minorities on either side. As a rule, the reports are spoken in Standard German, with
Danish subtitles or voice-over.
Radio Schleswig-Holstein (R.SH) produces programmes and features in Danish in
cooperation with the Danish newspaper "Flensborg Avis". These are broadcast several
times a day on weekdays, covering above all regional news. In addition, regional
windows are offered on special occasions, such as elections.

d. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
take measures to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works (Nos. 84 - 86).
The Flensburg branch of the Offener Kanal (OK) Schleswig-Holstein broadcasting
station regularly produces and broadcasts Danish programmes, which can be received
by members of the Danish minority in the coverage area (Flensburg, Schleswig, Niebüll,
Kappeln). The cooperation between the OK Flensburg branch and AI-TV, a non-profit
making television station in Apenrade, Denmark, plays a special role here.

2. Upper Sorbian in the Free State of Saxony
a. Article 8 (1) (b) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to take the
necessary measures so that the practical implementation of the “2 plus” model ensures
adequate language proficiency of the Upper Sorbian-speaking pupils (Nos. 105 – 112
and 113 - 119).

36
According to the Free State of Saxony the evaluation of the bilingual “2plus” model
project has been completed successfully. The goals of the project have been reached:


gaining empirical results regarding the promotion of active bilingualism and the
best development, promotion and revitalization of the Sorbian language, culture
and identity.



developing and testing differentiated approaches to the promotion of bi- and
multilingualism in order to find a strategic reply to differing education
backgrounds.

The project was accompanied by bi- and multilingualism experts and scientists of the
Institute for Sorbian Language and Culture at Leipzig University.
The “2plus” model project was launched in the 2002/2003 school year, involving all six
Sorbian primary schools, the Schleife primary school, the four Sorbian Mittelschulen
(secondary schools), the Schleife Mittelschule, and the Sorbian Gymnasium (grammar
school). Bilingual classes were set up, leaving the diverging linguistic backgrounds of the
pupils aside. All curricular and extracurricular education processes were bilingual.
The project involved 109 pupils in primary education, starting from grade one, and
91 pupils in grades five and six. In addition, a monolingual control group was established
in grades five and six, consisting of 41 pupils; this group was not taught in line with the
2plus model.
Annual benchmark tests were conducted and evaluated for both languages, beginning
with grade one. To this end, standardized analysis tools designed to monitor language
development in the context of bilingual education were adapted to accommodate the
Sorbian-German language pair. Initial analyses by the schools and detailed
questionnaires filled in by teachers and pupils were also evaluated.
Under the lead of the school coordinators for bilingualism the project schools
documented all measures taken to put the project into practice in everyday school life,
the teaching methods in bilingual classes, the curricular and extracurricular framework
conditions, the use of bilingual worksheets for specific subjects, the involvement of
parents and the strategic school work geared to bilingualism.
The surveys show that all pupils made considerable progress in their language
development with the help of the 2plus strategy. They had a better access to and attitude
towards the Sorbian language. The pupils taking part in the 2plus model project were
better able to read and write texts both in German and Sorbian. 2plus achieved a
contextual bi- and multilingualism enabling pupils to use their language skills in line with
the situation in hand.

b. Article 8 (1) (d) (iv)
In its latest report the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to continue
identifying proactively other areas where vocational training in Upper Sorbian might be
offered (Nos. 120 - 124).
The competent Saxon Education Agency (Bautzen Regional Office) is not aware of the
Domowina project mentioned by the Committee of Experts in No. 122, and was
obviously not involved in it. It points out that such an offer would not be realistic, given
the great variety of subjects covered and the great distances involved. Rather, the

37
authorities promote the preservation of Sorbian education at the Sorbian College for
Social Pedagogy (Sorbische Fachschule für Sozialpädagogik).

c. Article 8 (1) (h) (i)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the Saxon authorities to provide
further information on the implementation of the recruitment agreement which
guarantees Sorbian-speaking graduates a position (Nos. 125 - 126).
Leavers of the Sorbian Gymnasium (grammar school) may conclude such an
agreement, provided they intend to undergo teacher training. The Saxon Education
Agency (Bautzen Regional Office) and the Sorbian institutions provide annual
informational events. The students are guaranteed places for practical training. There
were problems in very rare cases where the would-be teachers had not concluded the
agreement, had not performed well in their studies or where they failed to contact the
Saxon Education Agency (Bautzen Regional Office) in time. However, remedies were
provided in all cases where the young teachers so wished. The Coordinator for Sorbian
Affairs at the Bautzen Regional Office has meanwhile established the routine of
requesting all Sorbian-speaking students doing teacher training to report back annually
about their progress in order to minimize the above-mentioned problems.

d. Article 8 (2)
In its latest evaluation report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to
take measures to make available Upper Sorbian education in a pro-active manner in
those places where the number of users would justify such an offer (Nos. 132 - 135).
According to the Saxon authorities this requirement is already met. Education offers are
provided or can be provided if and when the actual demand is signalled.

e. Article 9 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the Saxon authorities to take
measures to make it easier to use Upper Sorbian in the courts in practice (Nos. 136 139).
The right of Sorbs to use the Sorbian language in the courts in their home districts is
enshrined in Section 184 of the Judicature Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz, GVG) and
Section 9 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free State of Saxony (Gesetz über die
Sorben im Freistaat Sachsen (SächsSorbG), and is unconditionally ensured in practice.
Sorbian citizens have the right to present their concerns in Sorbian or in German. It is
particular in the regular jurisdiction that there are staff members (of various service
grades) who speak Sorbian well and are thus able to help Sorbian citizens. These
citizens are already well aware that they may use the Sorbian language in the courts.
Furthermore, most of the parties before the local courts and Bautzen Labour Court are
represented by lawyers who are also aware of the rights of Sorbian citizens.
Public events and law courses at grammar schools are used to make the population
aware of the fact that applications may be filed in Sorbian with the local courts and that
hearings may be conducted in the Sorbian language.

f. Article 10 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report the Committee of Experts encouraged the Saxon authorities to provide
specific information on the possibility to submit applications in Upper Sorbian to local and

38
regional authorities in other parts of the Upper Sorbian language area outside the core
area (Nos. 140 - 141).
Section 9 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free State of Saxony means that Saxony
has returned to the pure territorial principle with regard to official languages. Section 9 of
said Act governs the official use of the Sorbian language. Section 3 of the Act gives
citizens the right to use Sorbian in their dealings with the Saxon authorities and its
corporations, institutions and foundations. Using the Sorbian language has the same
effect as using German. The authorities may respond to, and adjudicate, such petitions
in Sorbian. Sorbian contact persons are only provided in the Sorbian settlement area,
however. Outside the area defined in Section 3 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the
Free State of Saxony, the state authorities need not accept or process letters submitted
in the Sorbian language.

g. Article 10 (2) and Article (3) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
measures in order to encourage the Upper Sorbian speakers to use their language in
their dealing with the authorities in practice (Nos. 142 - 145) and to ensure that replies
from public bodies are given in Upper Sorbian (Nos. 146 - 148).
The state administration, its bodies and local authorities may respond in Sorbian to
letters submitted in the Sorbian language, but they do not have to, as stipulated by
Section 9 of the Act on the Sorbs' Rights in the Free State of Saxony. As a rule it is
ensured, though, that where petitioners so request, the Sorbian language is used. The
authorities have little room for discretion here.
The state administration and the rural districts in the Sorbian settlement area have
commissioners for Sorbian affairs in place (e.g. Section 10 of the Statutes of the rural
district of Görlitz). In practice, the procedure is as follows: Incoming letters are handed
over to the commissioner for Sorbian affairs who sees to a translation into German
without delay. Generally, the competent agencies reply in German, unless the applicant
has requested a response in the Sorbian language.
A recent survey in the rural district of Görlitz has shown that, of the 2000 public service
employees, 27 actually speak Sorbian - a seemingly low, but actually sufficient number.
According to the rural districts in Saxony there have not been any complaints that cases
submitted in the Sorbian language took too long or were dealt with unsatisfactorily.

h. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
ensure compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of Lower Sorbian to be appointed in the territory in which that
language is used (Nos. 149–151).
The employment of Sorbian-speaking public service employees within the Sorbian
settlement area is a major concern of the Saxon government. This concern is worded as
goal 1.1 "More Sorbian language skills in the public service" as part of the "Plan of
Measures by the Saxon Government to Stimulate and Encourage the Use of the Sorbian
Language", which also serves the implementation of the measures requested under
letters g - h with regard to Article 10.

39
Two measures have been taken to reach the goal "More Sorbian language skills in the
public service" (measure 1.1.1 and measure 1.1.2). For instance, Sorbian language skills
are considered an asset for job applicants. Also, public service employees are to be
given the opportunity to acquire the Sorbian language skills they need for their job, e.g.
by attending adult education courses in the Sorbian settlement area.
Figures reflecting the number of applications filed by public service employees wishing to
move into the Sorbian-speaking area are not available, however.

i. Article 11 (1) (b) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to promote the
broadcasting of Upper Sorbian programmes by private radio broadcasters (Nos. 152 156).
The Act on Private Broadcasting in Saxony (Sächsisches Privatrundfunkgesetz
(SächsPRG), in its Section 7 (1), states that private broadcasters should represent the
views of minorities. There is one representative of the Sorbian associations in the
members' assembly of Saxony’s media authority (Sächsische Landesmedienanstalt ,
SLM), as stipulated by Section 29 (1) of said act. The Saxon training and trial channel
(Sächsischer Ausbildungs- und Erprobungskanal) , a Bautzen-based non-profit making
limited-liability company launched by the SLM, continues to be dedicated to broadcasts
in the Sorbian language.

j. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to promote the
broadcasting of Upper Sorbian television programmes on a regular basis (Nos. 157 162).
Section 6 (3) of the Inter-State Treaty on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) requires the
broadcasting station to represent the concerns of all groups of society, including that of
minorities. For this reason and also owing to constitutional requirements the MDR also
broadcasts programmes in the Sorbian language. The programmes are produced at the
regional studio in Bautzen. Since 2009 there have been few changes regarding the
Sorbian language TV broadcasts by MDR, which are as follows:
MDR airs a "tele-window" programme, "Wuhladko", in the Sorbian language on every
first Saturday of the month, at 12:25, which is repeated on the following Tuesdays at
09:15 throughout the MDR coverage area. The programmes can be received also via
live stream on the Internet. The monthly TV programme Wuhladko is now also available
on the internet for seven days after the first broadcast.
"Łužyca", a TV programme produced by Sorbs for Sorbs in the Lower Sorbian language,
is taken on by the Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg (RBB) broadcasting station and
broadcast at 13:20, and is repeated by the MDR regional service one week after it was
first broadcast by the RBB, usually on the 4th Saturday of the month.

k. Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities to provide information
on the application of financial existing measures for financial assistance also to
audiovisual productions in Upper Sorbian (Nos. 163 - 165).

40
The second agreement between the Federal Government and the state of Brandenburg
and the Free State of Saxony on joint funding for the Foundation for the Sorbian People
was signed on 10 July 2009. This means that the annual allocations to the Foundation
for the Sorbian People are ensured. That said, it is not possible to increase the funds to
support film productions. For this reason, Saxony put the focus on film projects for
children and young people in both Sorbian languages in the period under review. The
production of films is very costly. Synchronizing films might be another way of increasing
Sorbian-language offerings. Furthermore, technical developments in the audio-visual
sector had to be accommodated. From 2009 to 2011, eight co-funded projects were
completed. It has to be kept in mind that it is not always possible to complete a project
within a calender year.
In 2012, the Federal Ministry of the Interior gave financial assistance towards a
Domowina film production in the run-up to the 10th Lusatian International Folklore
Festival in 2013.

l. Article 13 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to strengthen
their efforts to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of Upper Sorbian in
connection with economic or social activities (Nos. 174 - 176).
The Saxon authorities have not taken any new measures in the period under review.

m. Article 13 (2) (c)
In its latest report the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to take
measures to ensure that social care facilities can receive and treat the persons
concerned in Upper Sorbian (Nos. 177 - 182).
The "Plan of Measures by the Saxon Government to Stimulate and Encourage the Use
of the Sorbian Language", contains the "use of the Sorbian language in social care
facilities (care homes, public health institutions) in the Sorbian settlement area" as goal
2.5, and specifically "intensifying the contact with the operators of hospitals and care
homes in the Sorbian settlement area" as measure 2.5.1. Social institutions such as
hospitals, retirement and other homes are to be made more aware of the benefits of
looking after Sorbian-speaking persons who need care owing to illness, old age or other
reasons in the Sorbian language.
The Saxon Education Ministry draws attention to its contribution to the Fourth Report,
according to which care in the Sorbian language in hospitals and social institutions in the
Upper Sorbian region is ensured on top of the "Plan of Measures by the Saxon
Government to Stimulate and Encourage the Use of the Sorbian Language".
Privately-run facilities select their own staff. They must fulfil legal requirements only as
regards the staff’s qualification. The facilities are subject to supervision but the
supervisory body cannot request a facility to employ Sorbian-speaking staff. Article 13
(2) of the Charter obligates the Contracting Parties only to the extent that “the public
authorities are competent”. However, public authorities are not competent in this area.
Holstein, distributes state funding to the Sinti and Roma with German citizenship living in
Schleswig-Holstein.

41
3. Lower Sorbian in Brandenburg
a. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the German authorities to allocate the
necessary resources for the provision of preschool education in Lower Sorbian (Nos.
186–191).
Ten nursery schools in Brandenburg provide child care using the Sorbian language.
These centres are operated by different providers, both local government and
independent child and youth welfare agencies. These providers are responsible for the
funding of their day-care centres.

b. Article 8 (1) (b) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts recommended that the German authorities
adopt and implement a structured policy for the promotion and preservation of Lower
Sorbian, including in particular measures which ensure that primary education is
available in this language (Nos. 192–195).
In the Cottbus school district, 20 public schools and one parochial school offer instruction
in Sorbian at all primary grade levels. The primary school in Drebkau offered Sorbian in
sixth grade for the first time in the 2011/12 school year. The Witaj project offers subject
instruction in Lower Sorbian at five schools. During the 2011/12 school year, 906 pupils
in the Cottbus district participated in Sorbian instruction at the primary level and 239
pupils took part in Witaj classes.
In the Wünsdorf school district, Sorbian is taught at two primary schools, one of which
also participates in the Witaj project. The schools offer Sorbian at all primary grade
levels. During the 2011/12 school year, 53 pupils in the Wünsdorf district participated in
Sorbian instruction and 45 took advantage of Witaj offerings.

c. Article 8 (1) (c) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts recommended that the German authorities
adopt and implement a structured policy for the promotion and preservation of Lower
Sorbian, including in particular measures which ensure that secondary education is
available in this language (Nos. 197–203).
The Lower Sorbian grammar school, the Oberstufenzentrum in Cottbus and three
Oberschulen offer Lower Sorbian classes at the secondary level.
In general, these are voluntary, with the exception of instruction at the Lower Sorbian
grammar school, where all pupils are required to take Sorbian as a second foreign
language.

d. Article 8 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts said it would welcome more information
about the teaching of the history and culture of the Sorbs at university level (Nos. 204–
206).
Since winter semester 2007/08, the University of Potsdam has offered a required
optional subject in the social sciences each semester for students training to be
teachers. Regardless of the specific type of teaching certificate sought (type of school,
subjects), students may choose to take a seminar on topics related to national

42
minorities/regional and minority languages in Germany/Sorbs/Wends in Brandenburg.
So far eleven seminars have been offered and 210 students have enrolled and assessed
the significance of the topic positively. These seminars are offered as a lectureship
funded by the teacher training centre, organized by the chair for civic education and
taught by a former staff member of the University of Potsdam. In addition to the abovementioned seminars, individual classes are offered, for example in the German
department, at the instructors' initiative, in which information about Sorbs/Wends is
integrated into classes on Low German.

e. Article 8 (1) (h)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
adopt a more structured policy with regard to teacher training, in close cooperation with
speakers of Lower Sorbian (Nos. 207 – 211).
The Arbeitsstelle für sorbische (wendische) Bildungsentwicklung (office for the
development of Sorbian/Wendish education) in Cottbus offers a two-year advanced
teacher training programme supervised by the University of Potsdam and the Verein
Weiterqualifizierung im Bildungsbereich (association for further qualification in education)
leading to an additional qualification in bilingual teaching and learning: Sorbian/Wendish
as a working language in primary education and secondary subject instruction. The
subjects of instruction are life choices/ethics/religion, physical education, history,
mathematics and music. In four cycles, about 33 teachers have successfully completed
the qualification. At the moment, no other teachers are in the pipeline to take the
qualification course; nonetheless, the Arbeitsstelle will continue to offer this measure as
a way to ensure the provision of high-quality Sorbian instruction.
In addition, the University of Leipzig still offers a continuing education master programme
in Lower Sorbian as mentioned in the last report. Five students completed the
programme during the reporting period. It has been agreed in principle to continue this
programme.
Based on current demand from school administrators, funding is available for individual
advanced and continuing training for teachers. Adult education centres
(Volkshochschulen) offer additional possibilities for further training.
At the University of Potsdam's teacher training centre, four pedagogical guides on
Sorbian topics have been produced and are available for free on the Internet.

f. Article 9 (1) (a) (ii) and (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts recommended that the German authorities
take resolute action to establish a structured policy for making it possible in practice to
use regional or minority languages in the courts (Nos. 217–219).
In criminal proceedings, defendants have the right to use Lower Sorbian in the courts,
and provision is made for submitting petitions and evidence in Lower Sorbian.
Proceedings in the civil, labour, administrative, financial and social courts also permit
documents and evidence to be presented in Lower Sorbian. No difficulties have been
reported with regard to the fulfilment of these undertakings by the administrative
authorities, courts, public prosecutors or authorities of the justice administration.

43
g. Article 10 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
take the necessary steps to ensure that the possibility to submit oral and written
applications in Lower Sorbian is guaranteed in practice (Nos. 220–224).
According to Section 4 of Brandenburg's Administrative Procedure Act (VwVfGBbg),
citizens who speak a minority language may submit oral and written applications in this
language to administrative authorities and public services, and documents presented in
this language are legally valid. According to this provision, Section 23 (2) to (4) of the
Federal Administrative Procedure Act (VwVfG) applies in the Sorbian settlement area on
the condition that Sorbian participants in proceedings are not charged for interpreters
and translators. Within the Sorbian settlement area, in derogation from Section 23 (3) of
the Federal Administrative Procedure Act, the time limit is in operation even if a
complaint, motion or declaration of intent is submitted to the authority in Lower Sorbian.

h. Article 10 (2) (b) and (3) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to encourage
Lower Sorbian speakers to submit oral or written applications to the authorities (Nos.
229–231) and encouraged the authorities to provide further detailed information with
regard to the possibility of submitting a request and receiving a reply in Lower Sorbian in
the case of public services provided by the administrative authorities or other persons
acting on their behalf (i.e. postal services, hospitals, electricity, public transport) (Nos.
225–228).
For the communities and municipal associations within the Sorbian settlement area,
protecting and promoting the Sorbian language represent key aspects of implementing
political and cultural work. This includes encouraging speakers of Lower Sorbian to
submit oral and written applications in the Sorbian language. Many communities and
municipal associations in the Sorbian settlement area use their names written in both
German and Lower Sorbian. In official correspondence, bilingual letterhead is most often
used. Publications are increasingly printed in two languages, and bilingual projects in
nursery schools, schools and clubs as well as communities and municipal associations
receive support and funding. Directional signs to and within authorities are usually
printed in both German and Lower Sorbian. The communities and municipal associations
within the Sorbian settlement area have commissioners for Sorbian/Wendish affairs,
some of them full-time, who represent the concerns of Sorbian individuals. The
commissioners serve as points of contact, also in case translation is needed, and
promote good relations between Sorbs and the non-Sorbian population. However, in
practice little use is made of the possibility to submit oral and written applications to
authorities in the Sorbian language, even though the conditions for processing and
responding to such applications are met.

i. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
ensure compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of Lower Sorbian to be appointed in the territory in which that
language is used (Nos. 232–234).
The Brandenburg State Ministry of the Interior has repeatedly consulted the other
ministries as well as communities and municipal associations in the Sorbian settlement

44
area and recommended that command of Lower Sorbian should be considered positively
when filling posts if this skill might be of use for performing the envisaged job. However,
according to Article 33 (2) of the Basic Law, which is implemented in Section 12 of the
Act on State Civil Servants, every German shall be equally eligible for any public office
according to his aptitude, qualifications and professional achievements so that command
of the Sorbian language cannot be generally considered a qualification criterion for
employment with public authorities. Command of Lower Sorbian plays a role in job
announcements and hiring whenever the job description for a specific post explicitly
requires it. The openings at the Lower Sorbian grammar school in Cottbus in recent
years were advertised in multiple languages. In this case, Sorbian language skills were a
selection criterion for participation in the recruitment process. The level of desired
language skills differed depending on the tasks or function advertised. For primary
school posts, job advertisements are published in multiple languages in the official
journal of the State Ministry for Education, Youth and Sport, if the post is for an institution
in which Lower Sorbian is taught. This applies in particular to primary schools
participating in the Witaj project (bilingual education). For such posts, knowledge of
spoken and written Lower Sorbian is a mandatory selection criterion. The Council for
Sorbian Affairs is kept informed of the results of recruitment processes. The Sorbian
language skills of a labour court judge who attended a Sorbian grammar school were a
positive factor in the decision to hire.

j. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to take
measures to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in
Lower Sorbian on a regular basis (Nos. 240 – 242).
Brandenburg continues to adhere to its position, represented in previous State Reports,
that the authorities do not have the right to take measures to encourage and/or facilitate
the broadcasting of television programmes in Lower Sorbian on a regular basis. Doing
so would violate the independence of the media. Due to the constitutional principle of
government non-intervention in broadcasting, the states have no influence on
programming content. Government is prohibited from exercising any influence
whatsoever on the programmes of broadcasters, which alone are responsible for
deciding on their content. For this reason, under broadcasting law the state of
Brandenburg cannot require the public broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB)
nor private broadcasters to televise programmes in Lower Sorbian.

k. Article 13 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the authorities to provide more
information on the measures taken to encourage and/or facilitate the use of Lower
Sorbian in economic and social activities.
The authorities are unable to present any information on new measures in this regard.

4. North Frisian in Schleswig-Holstein
a. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to make
available, systematically and through adequate institutional and financial support, at

45
least a substantial part of preschool education in North Frisian to those pupils whose
families so request (Nos. 257–261).
Among other things, child day care should encourage learning, including language
promotion. This also includes promoting minority and regional languages in day care.
However, the state is unable to provide direct financial support due to the transfer of
state funds under the Financial Equalization Act (FAG).
The amended act gives local governments (Kreise and kreisfreie Städte) greater
autonomy in their use of funds. It is, therefore, the task of the bodies responsible for the
children’s day-care centres offering North Frisian or Low German activities to negotiate
funding with the local government concerned. For the funding of Low German or North
Frisian language offerings, only the point of contact has changed, because the local
governments receive state funds in order to autonomously perform the tasks specified in
the Child and Youth Services Act (Social Code Book VIII) and other legal obligations.
Due to the importance of the minority and regional languages of Schleswig-Holstein, the
state government will examine whether additional funding can be provided.
From 1993 to 1996, at the initiative of the body set up by the Schleswig-Holstein state
parliament for issues related to the Frisian ethnic group (Gremium für Fragen der
friesischen Volksgruppe beim Schleswig-Holsteinischen Landtag), nursery schools in
Süderende on the island of Föhr and in Risum-Lindholm tested whether the Frisian
language could be permanently revived in a nursery-school context. On the basis of the
results, Frisian was introduced at additional nursery schools and is now being offered, to
varying extents, in 17 nursery schools. The language offerings depend on which Frisian
speakers are available and for how long. Language offerings range from thirty minutes a
week to the entire school day.

b. Article 8 (1) (b) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
make available North Frisian teaching as an integral part of the curriculum within primary
education (Nos. 262 – 266).
The state government of Schleswig-Holstein is not currently planning to introduce Frisian
as a regular subject, thus there is no corresponding curriculum. However, the institute for
advanced teacher training (IQSH) does have guides which are structured like lesson
plans.
During the 2012/13 school year, 802 pupils at 17 schools, including nine primary
schools, took classes in Frisian. To this end, the state allotted 21 instructors and 92
teaching hours per week. Against the backdrop of demographic change (the number of
primary school pupils in Schleswig-Holstein is steadily shrinking), this reduction in the
number of pupils corresponds to the overall trend at schools in Schleswig-Holstein.
To improve the acceptance and sustainability of Frisian instruction, the Nis-AlbrechtJohannsen-Schule in Risum-Lindholm (primary school) is currently testing Frisian
immersion classes in local history and social studies from third grade on, in addition to
Frisian language instruction. In this way, Frisian language skills are acquired along with
subject knowledge. In addition, the Frisian language gives pupils access to the cultural
values of the region.

46
c. Article 8 (1) (c) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
make available North Frisian teaching as an integral part of the curriculum within
secondary education (Nos. 267 – 271).
Frisian instruction continues to compete above all with English in primary education and
the classic foreign languages of the lower and upper secondary levels. Ultimately, it is
apparent that when Frisian is not spoken in everyday life, there is little motivation to learn
Frisian at school.
Frisian is taught at the secondary level in the Gymnasium in Wyk on the island of Föhr,
at the regional school on the island of Amrum, at three schools of the Danish minority
(Risum Skole/Risem Schölj, Bredsted Danske Skole and Vesterland-Kejtum Danske
Skole) and on Heligoland.

d. Article 8 (1) (h)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to ensure that
appropriate facilities for teacher training are in place to meet the needs for education in
North Frisian in a short and long term perspective and to provide incentives aimed at
increasing the number of North Frisian teachers at all levels of education (Nos. 272 –
275).
The supply of teachers for Frisian education in Schleswig-Holstein is largely ensured.
Despite the continuing low demand, Frisian is offered at the university level via a
certificate course as a supplementary examination with eight weekly hours.
Students usually complete their practical training in the subjects in which they took the
first state examination or completed their master degree. Because this is not possible for
Frisian, the Schleswig-Holstein state government created the following exception for
Frisian in practical training:


During their practical training, students may take Frisian as an additional module.
They receive a certificate after having completed at least 40 module hours. The
result of this additional training is taken into account when assigning the overall
grade for the second state examination.



Teacher candidates complete their additional practical training in Frisian at
schools where Frisian is taught, and they teach Frisian themselves under
supervision.



Teachers who have completed a certificate course in Frisian may also be
assigned to supervise teacher candidates.

In this way, a sufficient supply of Frisian teachers is ensured for the future.
The Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel introduced new courses of study effective
winter semester 2007/08. Since then, students may complete a bachelor or master in
Frisian philology under the two-subject model, and those in a teacher training course
may study Frisian for teaching at secondary level as an additional subject.
No students enrolled in Frisian as an additional subject in winter semester 2009/10,
winter semester 2010/11 or winter semester 2011/12, however. The University of Kiel
offers Frisian as a required elective for students in the teacher training course for
German; students must complete a course to be admitted to examinations.

47
In addition to providing information flyers, the university organizes information days to
present all aspects of Frisian philology at the university. It also informs pupils at the
Gymnasium in Wyk on the island of Föhr, which is the only Gymnasium offering
instruction in Frisian, about their possibilities for studying Frisian.
Ultimately, however, interest will be limited due to the lack of demand for Gymnasium
teachers in Frisian in Nordfriesland (limited career prospects).
At the University of Flensburg, Frisian is currently taught as part of the multi-disciplinary
bachelor course in education, which prepares students to teach at primary and
secondary schools (Hauptschulen, Realschulen) and special remedial schools
(Sonderschulen). As part of this course, proof of the successful completion of a class in
Low German or Frisian is required for admission to examinations in German. In addition,
students may major in German with a concentration in Frisian. This encompasses two
Frisian modules, one basic and one more intensive. Including the introductory course,
this option involves well over 600 credit hours.
Due to the lack of demand, limited capacities and limited options for assignment for
teachers with this training, master programmes for teacher candidates do not include a
Frisian concentration. In order to do justice to the importance of this minority language,
the University of Flensburg’s Centre for Advanced Training has offered a certificate
course in Frisian studies since the 2008/2009 winter semester which is open to students
in the teacher training course, guest students at the University of Flensburg and
teachers. This course builds on the relevant modules in the multi-disciplinary bachelor
course in education. Successful completion of the course qualifies graduates to teach
Frisian at schools in Schleswig-Holstein. As of January 2012, eleven persons completed
the master programme at the University of Flensburg with a qualification to teach Frisian;
three more are currently enrolled in the programme.
For winter semester 2013/14, the university is revising its teacher training courses in line
with the types of schools in Schleswig-Holstein (Grundschule, Regionalschule and
Gemeinschaftsschule) and expanding its master programme from two semesters to four.
In this context, the university is examining whether to lend even greater weight to the
Frisian concentration.
This demonstrates that neither the state nor the universities have given up trying to
strengthen Low German and Frisian.

e. Article 10 (1) (a) (v)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to provide
specific information in the next periodical report on measures taken to ensure that it is
possible in practice to validly submit documents in North Frisian (Nos. 280 – 282).
No new measures have been taken since the last report.

f. Article 11 (1) (b) (ii) and (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to continue to take
measures to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in
North Frisian on a regular basis (Nos. 283 – 290).
This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Consultative Committee on Issues
concerning the Frisian Ethnic Group with the Federal Minister of the Interior in November
2011, which representatives of the Federal Ministry, members of the German

48
Bundestag, representatives of the states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein and
members of the Frisian ethnic group also attended. Following the meeting and in line
with the principle of media autonomy, the Federal Government Commissioner for
Matters Related to Ethnic German Resettlers and National Minorities wrote to the chair
of the broadcasting board for the broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) asking
him to further promote radio and television broadcasts in Frisian.
According to their coalition agreement covering the period 2012–2017, the governing
coalition parties at state level – Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD, Social
Democratic Party of Germany), Bündnis 90/Die Grünen (Alliance 90/The Greens) and
Südschleswigscher Wählerverband (SSW, South Schleswig Voters' Association) – are
planning to argue with vigour in the NDR bodies to make sure that public service
broadcasting reflects the linguistic and cultural diversity prevailing in Schleswig-Holstein.
The current situation is as follows: Since September 2010, the Frisian radio station
FriiskFunk has broadcast from a permanent studio in Alkersum, on Föhr, Monday
through Friday, 8–9 a.m., in cooperation with the public-access station Offener Kanal
(OK) Schleswig-Holstein, the foundation Ferring-Stiftung and the Frisian Council. Frisianlanguage programmes are produced and broadcast on the frequencies of the OK for the
west coast. So FriiskFunk is available from Niebüll to Meldorf along the west coast of
Schleswig-Holstein, except for the northern half of the island of Sylt. In this way, it covers
part of the North Frisian language area.
The programme is also available as an Internet livestream via terrestrial FM. After they
are broadcast, Frisian-language programmes can be accessed on the Internet at
www.friiskfunk.de, where the archive now encompasses several hundred radio
programmes in Frisian.
NDR broadcasts both radio and television programming in Frisian. For example, the
state channel for Schleswig-Holstein, NDR 1 Welle Nord, offers Frisian speakers a wide
array of reporting on the region, its people and culture, in both German and Frisian, as
part of its news coverage, regular series and one-hour specials.
The regularly scheduled programme Frasch for enarken (Frisian for all) covers political
topics as well as entertainment. Depending on the topic, the German-language
programme Von Binnenland und Waterkant (Inland and at the water's edge) interviews
Frisian speakers in their native language, helping make sure that the Frisian language is
heard on the programme, independently and as a matter of course.
NDR 1 Welle Nord also occasionally produces hour-long programmes in Frisian. In
2009, an expensive programme was produced on the life of Frisian immigrants in New
York; it was broadcast in Frisian within the Frisian language area and in German in the
rest of the broadcasting area. The production, written by Elin Rosteck, received a special
prize at the 8th RADIOJournal awards.
Since 2001, NDR 1 Welle Nord and the Nordfriisk Instituut (North Frisian Institute) have
organized a writing and storytelling competition, Ferteel iinjsen, every two years. The
competition seeks short stories on various topics written in Fräisch, Freesch, Halunder,
Ömrang or Sölring. NDR 1 Welle Nord chooses the five best stories, which can be heard
on the Internet.
The competition encourages large numbers of people not only to speak Frisian, but also
to write in Frisian. Ferteel iinjsen thus helps preserve Frisian while encouraging its

49
development. The competition receives extensive radio and television coverage, and
NDR 1 Welle Nord presents the highlights of the final event in a one-hour show. The
theme for the 2012 competition was Ferteel iinjsen - wat for da Bjarne, Jongen, Künner
(Tell me a story - something for children). The competition has since evolved into an
effective way to promote authors and literature.
In addition to its long cooperation with the OK Westküste, NDR also supports FriiskFunk
on the island of Föhr and provides targeted funding for basic and advanced staff training.
NDR also provides FriiskFunk access free of charge to its current Frisian-language
programmes and its extensive archives.
NDR 1 Welle Nord regularly offers internships to students of Frisian. This project has
been very successful. Many interns have gone on to work freelance for NDR radio and
television. Thanks to advanced training for freelancers, especially those in Nordfriesland
and Flensburg, numerous programmes in Frisian (with subtitles) have been broadcast. In
addition to reports on Frisian culture, traditions and institutions, promotion of the Frisian
language at schools, in academia and in the media is especially important.
Television programmes produced at the NDR broadcasting centre in Schleswig-Holstein
(Schleswig-Holstein Magazin and Schleswig-Holstein 18:00) regularly report on Frisian
issues and personalities. In order not to interfere with the original Frisian and because
the number of persons in Schleswig-Holstein who understand Frisian is limited,
programmes are usually subtitled in High German, or they are produced in High German
and include some spoken Frisian.
On 8 October 2011, NDR television organized a special night of programming dedicated
to all things Frisian, with documentary films about Heligoland, Nordfriesland and
Ostfriesland produced in the Frisian language area.
The NDR 1 Welle Nord website at www.wellenord.de has a link to Frisian pages with a
wealth of information about related topics, including information about the series Frasch
for enarken which is available in German, Fering and Frasch. The website also offers
access to an extensive audio archive with 50 Frisian radio programmes to listen to and
more detailed information about the writing and storytelling competition Ferteel iinjsen.
The various Frisian dialects are explained at length. A Frisian language course is also
offered.
Radio Schleswig-Holstein (R.SH) does not have a specific time slot for Frisian
programming. The radio station says that the regional and minority languages are
occasionally included in programming, for example in regional news, event calendars or
games.

g. Article 11 (1) (e) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to take
measures to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper articles in North
Frisian on a regular basis (Nos. 295 – 297).
In response to this recommendation, the state of Schleswig-Holstein refers once again to
the freedom of the press in Germany, which prohibits any government influence on press
publications.

50
h. Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the German authorities to
provide, in the next periodical report, information about audiovisual productions in North
Frisian that have been supported by the Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein
(Nos. 298 – 301).
The Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein GmbH does not give North Frisian any
preference in the area of funding, production or broadcasting of audio or audiovisual
works. Funding is granted exclusively on the basis of quality- and content-related criteria.
No Frisian films received funding during the reporting period, as no funding applications
were submitted.

i. Article 12 (1) (e)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
provide specific information on measures taken to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organizing or supporting cultural activities other than the Frisian organizations have at
their disposal staff who have a full command of Frisian (Nos. 302 –303).
The state of Schleswig-Holstein has not taken any new measures in this area since the
fourth periodical report.

j. Article 14 (1) (a)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts stated that, according to the information
provided, no international agreements required by the undertaking existed and no
negotiations were under way (Nos. 308 – 309).
No measures were taken during the reporting period.

5. Sater Frisian in Lower Saxony
a. Article 1 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to provide more
information on the results of projects in the area of preschool education in Sater Frisian
(Nos. 313 – 316).
Public and private providers of youth welfare are responsible for preschool education
curriculum at day-care centres. These must decide locally and in close consultation with
parents' representatives whether and how Sater Frisian may be part of the profile of one
or more day-care centres. The state government does not require Sater Frisian to be
taught at nursery schools (Kindertagesstätten). The orientation plan for the field of
language and speaking states: "In regions where a regional language is spoken (e.g.
Low German), multilingualism is a good way to enhance language comprehension and
speaking skills.” This applies not only to Low German, but also to Sater Frisian.

b. Article 8 (1) (e) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the Lower Saxony authorities for
information about the further development and sustainability of current Sater Frisian
offerings at universities and other institutions of higher education (Nos. 317 – 319).
In recent years, the focus on Low German assigned to the new chair for German
philology at the University of Oldenburg has been expanded into a focus on Low German

51
and Sater Frisian. Since summer semester 2009, a practical course in Sater Frisian has
been offered every academic year by a native speaker of Sater Frisian. This course is
open to all students as well as junior research and teaching staff who hope to benefit
from the study of Low German and Sater Frisian or who have a general interest in
dialects or linguistic typology. Those who successfully complete the course receive a
certificate from the Seelter Buund, the Saterland Frisian association for the preservation
of regional and local traditions. In the past, doctoral students from outside the Low
German and Sater Frisian focus have also taken the course.
The focus on Low German and Sater Frisian provided the impetus for the joint project on
Saterland as a model region for early multilingualism, which has been conducting a
multi-year continuing education programme for nursery and primary school teachers in
Saterland since mid-2011 in cooperation with the project on Ostfriesland as a model
region for early multilingualism (project to run from 2011 to 2015). This project is
intended to expand the supply of immersion language teaching at day-care centres and
primary schools in Saterland. Should the plan to transfer parts of nursery school teacher
training to the University of Oldenburg in the coming years be carried out, then the Low
German focus would also be involved in this training, in which the topics of early
multilingualism and language immersion are especially relevant.
The focus on Low German and Sater Frisian has close ties to non-academic institutions.
Its cooperation with the associations Oldenburgische Landschaft, the Ostfriesische
Landschaft, the Niedersächsischer Heimatbund and the Seelter Buund deserve
particular mention.
A new edition of Dr Fort's Sater Frisian dictionary is in the works, with financial
support from the state of Lower Saxony. Further, in 2011 the focus on Low German
and Sater Frisian helped produce the Frisian language textbook Friesischer
Sprachkurs: Seeltersk by Johanna Evers, published by Ramsloh press. The
Oldenburgische Landschaft provided financial support for these efforts.
Please see also the comments on Article 7 (1) (c) in Chapter E. I. 1. b.

c. Article 8 (1) (f) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the Lower Saxony authorities to
take measures to re-establish an offer of adult education in Sater Frisian (Nos. 320 –
321).
Institutions of adult education in Lower Saxony, which are funded in accordance with the
Lower Saxony Adult Education Act (NEBG), regularly offer courses in Low German
language and culture. These also include courses to learn Sater Frisian, which are
mainly offered in the Saterland region. Due to the small size and population of the
municipality of Saterland (approx. 124 square km, approx. 13,136 residents), only a
limited number of language courses are offered and are not listed separately here.
The NEBG does not currently allow direct influence to be exerted on institutions of adult
education, for example to expand offerings in the area of Sater Frisian.
The responsible ministry is currently considering whether to provide funding for
workshops or similar local events to expand the range of Sater Frisian language
offerings.

52
d. Article 8 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the German authorities to
provide more specific information in the next periodical report on the extent to which the
teaching of the history and the culture which is reflected by Sater Frisian is ensured in
practice, not only in the education of Sater Frisians, but also in mainstream education in
the region (Nos. 322 – 324).
The decree "Die Region und ihre Sprachen im Unterricht" (The region and its languages
in the classroom) specifies that, when teaching regional content, the languages of the
region should always be included. This is mandatory in subject-specific instruction and is
also the case in the teaching of required electives, in activity groups and through
offerings at all-day schools. For all types of schools, the core curriculum for the individual
subjects of instruction provide for including the regional context when planning lessons.
School curriculum must take this context into account particularly in the subjects biology,
German, geography, history, political science, religion, basic science, economics, music
and art.
To preserve the Sater Frisian language, the state funds a range of projects, some of
them having an impact beyond the state's borders. These include the Sater Frisian
dictionary produced by Dr Marron Fort, the Seelter Buund project to preserve Sater
Frisian as a cultural asset for future generations and the Oldenburgische Landschaft
projects on Saterland as a model region for early multilingualism and the Sater Frisian
language course.

e. Article 8 (1) (i)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the Lower Saxony authorities for
more information about the outcome of the revision of the decree "The Region in
Classroom Instruction" (Nos. 325 – 328).
Please see the comments on Article 7 (1) (c) in Chapter E. I. 1. b.

f. Article 10 (1) (a) (v) and (c), (2) (c) and (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to take the
necessary steps to ensure that the users of Sater Frisian may validly submit a document
in Sater Frisian and to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in Sater
Frisian (Nos. 329 – 333) and to take measures to encourage the local publication of
official documents also in Sater Frisian (Nos. 337 – 342).
The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is directly applicable law, so
no further legislation is needed to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents
in Sater Frisian. In the same way, users of Sater Frisian are quite free to validly submit
documents in Sater Frisian.

g. Article 10 (2) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
positive measures to make it possible in practice to use Sater Frisian in dealings with the
administration (Nos. 334 – 336).
Please see the comments on Article 10 (1) (a) (v) and (c) in Chapter E. II. 5. f.

53
Given the right of local self-government, the state government is not allowed to set rules
for the use of Sater Frisian in local administration. The European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages has the status of law, so local governments are bound by its
provisions when performing their tasks.
The local governments are aware of the need to enable the use of Sater Frisian in
dealings with public administration.

h. Art. 10 (2) (e) and (f)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts emphasized that it is possible to encourage
the use of Sater Frisian in assemblies of regional and local authorities, at least on a
symbolic level (Nos. 343 – 345).
The regional and local authorities are aware of the need to use Sater Frisian in
assemblies as far as possible.

i. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
ensure compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of Sater Frisian to be appointed in the territory in which that
language is used (Nos. 349 – 352).
The right of local self-government must be respected also when it comes to the
deployment of staff who ask to be assigned in the Sater Frisian language area. As part
of their authority to hire and dismiss staff, local governments are free to decide where to
assign their staff. However, it may be assumed that language skills are taken into
consideration when hiring or evaluating requests for transfer.

j. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii), (1) (d) and (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the German authorities to adopt
positive measures aimed at encouraging and/or facilitating the broadcasting of television
programmes in Sater Frisian on a regular basis (Nos. 356 – 359), the production of audio
and audiovisual works (Nos. 360 – 362) in Sater Frisian and provide financial assistance
to audiovisual productions in Sater Frisian (Nos. 366 – 368).
This issue was discussed at the meeting of the Consultative Committee on Issues
concerning the Frisian Ethnic Group with the Federal Minister of the Interior in November
2011, which representatives of the Federal Ministry, members of the German
Bundestag, representatives of the states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein and
members of the Frisian ethnic group also attended. Following the meeting and in line
with the principle of media autonomy, the Federal Government Commissioner for
Matters Related to Ethnic German Resettlers and National Minorities wrote to the chair
of the broadcasting board for the broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) asking
him to further promote radio and television broadcasts in Frisian.
In addition, it should be noted that the public-access radio station Ems-Vechte-Welle
now broadcasts the programme Middeeges in Sater Frisian and Low German every
second Sunday from 11:03 to 13:00 (with brief interruptions for the news). NDR also
broadcasts occasional programmes on the Sater Frisian language and Saterland, in
which Sater Frisian is also spoken.

54
In the past it was explained that financial assistance for broadcasts in the minority
language Sater Frisian may be applied for in accordance with the guidelines of Lower
Saxony's media authority regarding grants for public-access radio.
Like every form of state aid, funding for Sater Frisian radio must be applied for and
therefore requires interested parties to take the initiative. In principle, Lower Saxony
welcomes appropriate applications for funding. The representatives of the interests of
Saterland Frisians are welcome to apply for the funding indicated.

k. Article 12 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the Lower Saxony authorities for
more specific information on the effect of the transfer of the task of promoting Sater
Frisian to the Oldenburger Landschaft e.V. (Nos. 369 – 370).
A traineeship was created at the Oldenburgische Landschaft, among other things to
support the interests of Saterland Frisians; in 2012, this position was made permanent.
Funding for the position in 2012 and 2013 is provided by the state of Lower Saxony. The
institutional funding for the Oldenburgische Landschaft was increased accordingly. The
Oldenburgische Landschaft will assume responsibility for funding the position starting in
2014. Making the position permanent has already had a significant impact on support for
Saterland Frisians, as the following projects illustrate: A Sater Frisian language course
with an accompanying CD; the books The Little Prince and Shock-Headed Peter
published in Sater Frisian; the project on Saterland as a model region for early
multilingualism; training for nursery school teachers in Sater Frisian; design of a logo;
immersion instruction at primary schools and nursery schools; Sater Frisian postcard
contest; refurbishment of the roof of the Saterland Frisian Kulturhuus. The municipality of
Saterland is preparing an application for funding from the state of Lower Saxony in order
to add an acoustic ceiling and create listening stations in Sater Frisian at the information
centre of the Bokelesch chapel; an application for funding from the Federal Ministry of
the Interior for a cultural tourism project is also being prepared.

6. Low German in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen
a. Article 8
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to to continue
the steps towards establishing a systematic approach to Low German education
(Nos. 379 - 380).
Low German continues to be part of the curricula for primary and secondary education in
Bremen. Specific details are left to the schools.

b. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report the Committee of Experts requested the authorities to provide further
information about the extent to which Low German is used in pre-school education and
to present a systematic approach (Nos. 381 – 383).
Low German continues to be promoted especially in day-care centres in the regions
bordering on Lower Saxony; to this end, children learn rhymes/verses and songs in Low
German in an effort to keep the regional language alive. At present, there is no
increased demand for pre-school education in Low German beyond what is presently on
offer.

55
c. Article 8 (1) (b) (iii)
The Committee of Experts strongly urges the authorities of the Free Hanseatic City of
Bremen to adopt a structured approach with a view to ensuring that Low German is
systematically taught within primary education with regular school hours allocated to it
(Nos. 384 - 386).
Based on the curricular provisions governing German in primary education, Low German
is offered as part of German classes and across subject areas. Pupils regularly learn
Low German poems and songs in primary education; some primary schools also offer
Low German working groups (seven primary schools in Bremen, four in Bremerhaven).
Parts of basic science classes are also taught in Low German.
The state of Bremen organizes an annual Low German reading competition. In 2012,
42 primary school pupils from Bremen and 30 from Bremerhaven took part in the urban
district competition, and 35 primary school pupils in the rural district competition.

d. Article 8 (1) (c) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to take the
necessary measures to make the teaching of Low German within secondary education
more systematic with regular school hours allocated to it (Nos. 388 – 390).
In secondary education, Low German is taught across subject areas (e.g. in music
classes). The German curriculum, specifically the teaching of German, seeks to enable
pupils to establish a cultural identity. Regional language, colloquial and Standard
German phrases are identified, as well as regional variants. Similarities between Low
German and English are addressed.
It is up to the individual schools to decide to what extent they wish to teach Low German
as part of the overall curriculum. Two secondary schools in the state of Bremen have
Low German working groups in place.
Two secondary schools in Bremen and Bremerhaven took part in the 2012 Low German
reading competition.

e. Article 8 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
ensure the teaching of the history and the culture which is reflected by Low German
(Nos. 391 – 394).
This is the purpose of teaching of Low German across subject areas. For instance, parts
of the basic science classes in primary schools and of global or environmental science
and history classes in secondary schools are taught in Low German.

f. Article 8 (1) (h)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to provide basic
and further training of teachers of Low German (Nos. 395 – 397).
In the Federal Republic of Germany, teacher training consists primarily of the
corresponding university studies. In Bremen, regular teacher training studies take five
years, while the practical training period takes only 18 months. Low German is part of
the regular university teacher training.

56
The Land Institute for Schools (Landesinstitut für Schule) offered Low German as an
optional compulsory course during the practical teacher training; however, there was an
insufficient number of students wishing to attend the course so that it was cancelled.
There were two reasons for this: The teacher trainees either spoke Low German already
or learning it did not have a high priority for them.

g. Article 10 (1) (a) (v), (1) (c), (2) (a), (b), (c) and (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to


take resolute action to establish a structured policy for making it possible to use
regional or minority languages in dealings with the administration (Nos. 398 –
400),



take specific measures to make sure that a certain degree of implementation
follows the mere “allowing” of documents to be drafted in Low German (Nos. 401
– 403),



not only allow the use of Low German within regional or local authorities, but to
take specific measures to implement the undertaking in practice (Nos. 404 –
406),



not only to allow oral and written applications to be submitted in Low German, but
also to take specific measures to implement the undertaking in practice (Nos. 407
– 409), and



to encourage local and regional authorities to publish official documents in Low
German (Nos. 410 – 412).

The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen upholds its view that no separate administrative
provisions are necessary to comply with this undertaking, as the Charter constitutes
directly enforceable law in Germany. The Charter only makes it inadmissible to prohibit
the use of a regional language; it does not require positive action. For this reason
Bremen feels it is not necessary to take further measures to fulfil the four abovementioned undertakings.
That said, the Senator of the Interior and Sport, in April 2011, sent a letter to the
authorities and staff members in his remit, taking up the recommendations the
Committee of Experts made in its latest report. He once again drew attention to the
undertakings under the Charter and encouraged the staff members to be open towards
citizens presenting their concerns in Low German and speak with them in that language,
or, if they do not speak the regional language themselves, to refer them to other
colleagues who do. The managers of authorities have been requested to look into
establishing a Low German contact person for their remit.
Furthermore, employees have been invited to bring to the attention of the management
any publications or other documents that should also be published in Low German.
Employees have been encouraged to speak Low German at the workplace, provided all
those involved actually speak the regional language. As a result, Low German is spoken
in various offices.

57
h. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to encourage the
broadcasting of television programmes in Low German on a regular basis, for instance
through financial incentives (Nos. 413 – 416).
It should be noted that, owing to the freedom of broadcasting and the freedom of the
press guaranteed by the German constitution, it is not possible to interfere in or
determine the programming by public or private providers. Against this backdrop, the
diversity requirements in the Media Act (Landesmediengesetz) have been amended to
require providers to broadcast an adequate share of programmes in Low German.
Although the provision to promote the use of Low German only amounted to an appeal
to providers until then, both public and private providers regularly represented Low
German topics and the Low German language.
Radio Bremen, a public service broadcaster, has a Low-German speaking news
presenter on the payroll, who presents news and events concerning Low German topics
as they happen in the Low German language. In May 2012, a programme in the "buten
un binnen" series was completely dedicated to Low German.
Sat1regional and RTLregional, two regional private broadcasting stations, cover news
and events in Low German as they happen. According to the situation in hand, Low
German topics are covered and/or reports are broadcast in the Low German language.
Center.tv Bremen, another regional private broadcaster, has a weekly format called
"NORDreporter", covering human interest stories and accommodating Low German
issues. Center.tv Bremen is planning to launch a series in autumn of 2012 called
"Spuren der niederdeutschen Sprache und Erlernen dieser" (Traces of Low German;
Learning the Language), to be aired by the daily regional magazine of center.tv.
The public-access television broadcasting station Bürgerrundfunk Bremen (Radio
Weser.TV) has produced its own television programme based on the radio programme
entitled “De Plattsnuten”. Also, some Low German theatre productions are broadcast.

i. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
take measures to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works in Low German (Nos. 417 – 419).
Radio Bremen covers events and news concerning Low German as they happen; also,
reports are broadcast in Low German. For instance, "Bremen Eins", a specialized
programme service provided by Radio Bremen, broadcasts news in Low German every
weekday at 10:30. "Nordwestradio", a programme service provided by Radio Bremen
and Norddeutscher Rundfunk, regularly presents Low German media. In the programme
series “Gesprächszeit” i.a. Low German speakers are invited along to talk. During the
live radio broadcast “Nordwestradio unterwegs” on-site reports on Low German matters
such as Low German teaching at schools are aired by Nordwestradio.
Private broadcasters also take care to represent Low German issues in various ways.
The news presenter of the "Moin" programme provided by ENERGY Bremen speaks
Low German and covered the 2011 elections to the Bremen parliament in that language.
It should be noted that ENERGY Bremen has been honoured by the "Verein Deutsche
Sprache e.V." (a non-profit making association to promote German as an independent
cultural language) for its efforts to preserve and maintain Low German, and has been

58
made the official sponsor of the word "Moin!" (standing for "good morning" or "hello").
ENERGY Bremen also supports the Hip-Hop Band "De Fofftig Penns", which produces
Low German songs, by presenting their songs and videos. The broadcaster also
advertises Low German events in the coverage area.
Bürgerrundfunk Bremen, a public-access radio service, enables citizens to produce
programmes in Low German. The public-access television broadcasting programme of
Radio Weser.TV regularly represents Low German by broadcasting programmes such
as "De Plattsnuten", "Plattdütsch to'n Koffie" and news or theatre productions in Low
German. Finally, Bürgerrundfunk Bremen and the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache
(Institute for Low German, INS) make every effort to exchange information regarding the
Low German language.

j. Article 11 (1) (e) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to take
measures to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper articles in Low
German on a regular basis (Nos. 420 – 422).
The Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (Institute for Low German, INS), a Bremenbased publicly funded agency, operates "ins-presse", a press service which is active
throughout northern Germany and regularly disseminates news regarding Low German
topics.
The public service radio broadcaster Radio Bremen posts Low German news and
contributions or interviews on its website every day. A programme for smartphones - the
"Plattdeutsch App" (Low German App) has been developed and is made available free
of charge. Internet and app users can receive Low German news and learn the language
with the help of a language course, during which a new teaching unit is posted every
week.

k. Article 11 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to provide more
specific information on the support for the training of journalists and other staff for media
using Low German in the next periodical report (Nos. 423 – 425).
In Germany, there are no regulations governing the training of journalists; most of the
journalists are trained in private schools or media companies. The state does not exert
an influence on the teaching contents, because that would violate the constitution.
Where students of state universities decide to go into journalism, they may use the Low
German offerings of Bremen University as part of their studies (not as part of the
journalist training).

l. Article 12 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
foster access in Low German to works produced in other languages (Nos. 426 – 428).
If "works" are construed to mean not only literary works but also other linguistic products,
Bremen has a 35-year history of translating "Low German news". Every day, Radio
Bremen translates the news and the weather report from Standard German into Low
German, in the process of which many new Low German terms need to be coined. This
work helps not only to preserve but also to develop the language. The terms are

59
recorded by the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (Institute for Low German, INS) and
are made accessible to the wider public via the Internet.

m. Article 12 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to ensure that the
bodies responsible for organizing or supporting cultural activities make appropriate
allowance for incorporating the knowledge and use of the Low German language and
culture (Nos. 429 – 431).
The parliament of the city-state of Bremen, after discussing the situation of Low German
in the state of Bremen in depth, decided, on 18 October 2012, to set up an Advisory
Council on Low German ("Beirat Platt") to the President of the city parliament. It
represents all areas affected by Low German: the parliamentary groups, the INS, the
Low German umbrella organizations of Bremen and Bremerhaven, and representatives
of the schools, the scientific community, the media, the theatre, the churches and the
administration etc. This advisory council serves to share information and to make sure
that the language group participates in all cultural matters.

n. Article 12 (1) (f)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to encourage direct
participation by representatives of the users of Low German in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities (Nos. 432 – 434).
The Free Hanseatic City of Bremen fulfils this undertaking indirectly, by promoting the
Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (Institute for Low German, INS) institutionally, by
paying an headquarter state contribution on top of the the state contribution.
The INS serves as an information and networking agency for cultural organizations,
groups and individuals, supporting and encouraging all those who speak Low German or
wish to promote the language and its culture. Ultimately, it seeks to encourage more
people to take an interest in and seek to preserve the regional language and the culture
it involves.

o. Article 13 (2)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to adopt a structured
policy with a view to making more systematic the possibility to be received and treated in
Low German in social care facilities (Nos. 439 – 442).
Many facilities in Bremen employ staff speaking Low German. This means that the
reception and treatment in Low German is generally ensured. It is not possible to do
more because most of the social care facilities are privately run, which means that the
state cannot impose requirements concerning the recruitment of staff. On top of that, it
would not make much sense to introduce such a requirement at this stage, because it
will be difficult to meet the foreseeably high demand for nursing staff in the years to
come to begin with.

7. Low German in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
a. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities for information on the
practical implementation of the directive on the cultivation of the Low German language

60
at preschools. In particular, the Committee asked for clarification on the extent to which
Low German is taught at preschools (Nos. 446 – 448).
In its directive on preschool classes (Richtlinie für die Bildung und Erziehung in
Vorschulklassen), the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg requires in the context of
language promotion “great variety of learning situations enabling pupils to acquire the
basic means and skills for interaction”. This also applies to Low German where it is
spoken as a second language. The extent of instruction in the regional language
depends on the group being taught and their language skills.
All other pupils who are not active speakers of Low German are to be familiarized with
the language, in particular through poems and songs. The Hamborger Plattdüütsch
Pries, an award given by the Low German association Plattdüütsch in Hamborg in
cooperation with the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg since 2010, has provided a
boost to preschool instruction. The competition is aimed at (pre-) schools and nursery
schools which continually work to teach Low German to the children in their care.
As part of the family literacy project of the state institute for teacher training and school
development (Landesinstitut für Lehrerbildung und Schulentwicklung), which actively
involves parents in their preschool children's acquisition of written language, in 2011
parents wrote stories in Low German about family photos, which were then published in
the multilingual series of mini-books.

b. Article 8 (1) (c) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
pursue their efforts to make the teaching of Low German an integral part of the
curriculum within secondary education (Nos. 453 – 455).
In the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, schools offer Low German as an optional
subject. Under the current regulations, schools may set areas of focus by teaching Low
German in particular (cf. Section 36 of the regulations for training and examinations in
primary schools and grades five through ten of local schools and grammar schools
(Gymnasien) (APO-GrundStGy)).

c. Article 8 (1) (d) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to include Low
German as an integral part of the curriculum within technical and vocational education
(Nos. 456 – 458).
Some vocational schools use elements of the Low German culture and language or
make reference to them. Because the primary task of vocational schools is to impart
occupational skills and strengthen skills in the subjects of mathematics, language and
communication (German) and technical English, there are no plans to anchor Low
German in the curriculum on a large scale.

d. Article 8 (1) (h)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for more information about the reform
of basic and further training for teachers of Low German (Nos. 459 – 461).
The state institute for teacher training and school development regularly offers further
training for primary school teachers on the teaching of Low German. For example, two

61
classes on Low German at primary schools – introducing the language, songs and
dances – were offered at the 2012 conference for primary school teachers.
Since 2010, the state institute for teacher training has offered a Low German forum
every two years. School administrators and teachers as well as university students with
a concentration in Low German, school volunteers, media representatives, artists and
advocacy groups are all invited. The forum aims to promote exchange among forum
participants and maintain a network to help with instruction.

e. Article 10 (1) (a) (v) and (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts repeated that the authorities must take
proactive measures to encourage speakers of Low German to avail themselves of the
opportunity to submit documents in Low German and not merely to allow administrative
authorities to draft documents in Low German, but to take specific measures to
implement the undertaking in practice (Nos. 466 – 471).
The authorities of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg are not aware of any cases in
which a document has been submitted in Low German or in which anyone has asked
whether it is possible to do so. For this reason, the authorities see no need to take
proactive measures, also in view of the extra effort and expense such measures would
require.

f. Article 10 (2) (a)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities not only to allow the
use of Low German in the framework of regional or local authorities, but also to take
specific measures to implement the undertaking in practice (Nos. 472 – 474).
At the Hamburg state archives, there are cases in which staff and members of the public
began by speaking to each other in High German and then both switched to Low
German; the reaction from the members of the public was always very positive. This
most often happens with older clients who staff are fairly sure have the relevant
language skills and hope to overcome initial fears by switching to Low German.
Beyond that, the authorities see no need to take any measures; see also comments on
Article 10 (1) (v) and (1) (c).

g. Article 10 (2) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities not only to allow oral
and written applications to be submitted in Low German, but also to take specific
measures to implement the undertaking in practice (Nos. 475 – 477).
Individual offices offer members of the public the opportunity to submit oral or written
applications in Low German if they so desire. For documentation purposes, however,
these applications then have to be translated into High German.
Beyond that, the authorities see no need to take any measures; see also comments on
Article 10 (1) (v) and (1) (c).

h. Article 10 (4)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
ensure compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees

62
having a knowledge of Low German to be appointed in the territory in which that
language is used (Nos. 478 – 481).
The competent bodies are not aware of any employees having made such a request.

i. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to encourage the
broadcasting of television programmes in Low German on a regular basis (Nos. 482 –
485).
As a public broadcaster, NDR is an advocate for the Low German language, culture and
literature. It has steadily expanded its Low German programming over the years. In
addition to its broadcasts, it has also demonstrated social engagement on behalf of Low
German, for example by participating in various bodies and serving on various boards
dedicated to Low German.
The regional evening programmes from the four states that make up the NDR
transmission area provide up-to-date coverage of Low German topics and events in the
Low German language. Content ranges from state and local politics to culture and
education as well as science, research and society.
NDR also broadcasts regularly scheduled programmes in Low German, such as


Plattdüütsch, with the latest news on politics, the economy, sport and culture;



Die Welt op Platt, with features on how German emigrants are maintaining their
traditions abroad; and



Neues aus Büttenwarder op Platt, a regional cult comedy with well-known actors.

NDR also offers a special Low German web presence where all audio and video
broadcasts with Low German content can be accessed.
The commercial television station Hamburg 1 occasionally includes elements of the Low
German language in its programme. However, the station has no statistics on the extent
of such broadcasts.
In this context, it is necessary to refer to the constitutional principle of government nonintervention in broadcasting, according to which television and radio broadcasters have a
great deal of autonomy. The aims of the Charter cannot be "government mandated" in
this area, but only undertaken and achieved jointly in practice.

j. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
take measures to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works in Low German (Nos. 486 – 488).
The Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein GmbH does not give Low German any
preference in the area of funding, production or broadcasting of audio or audiovisual
works. Funding is granted exclusively on the basis of quality- and content-related criteria.
The association Plattolio e.V. was founded on 20 May 2011, also with public funding; it
aims to foster the younger generation's interest in Low German from an early age. The
association's website www.plattolio.de is intended to help achieve this aim. Its target
audience includes sponsors and multipliers in schools and cultural institutions in the Low

63
German language area, and it provides suitable materials to support Low German
language teaching.

k. Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to apply existing
measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual productions in Low German
(Nos. 489 – 491).
Although financial assistance measures (film promotion) for audiovisual productions do
exist, they do not provide for any preferential treatment of Low German. Funding is
granted exclusively on the basis of quality- and content-related criteria.

l. Article 11 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to support the
training of journalists and other staff for media using Low German (Nos. 492 – 493).
The University of Hamburg offers classes on Low German language and literature in the
subject areas of German language and literature (bachelor degree programme),
Germanic linguistics (master degree programme) and German (bachelor and master in
teaching). The department of language, literature and media is responsible for these
classes. The Institute for Journalism and Communications does not offer any courses
explicitly focused on the Low German language. However, students may choose
electives in other subject areas including classes in or about Low German.
Students may also take Low German language courses at the interdisciplinary language
centre. The University of Hamburg currently has no course offerings to promote Low
German which are exclusively intended for journalists.
NDR offers journalism training in the form of an internship programme for radio,
television and online content. The internships include three assignments at an NDR
regional studio, so that interns come into contact with the Low German language,
content and topics wherever they are covered. NDR does not offer specific or obligatory
promotion in Low German.
NDR's central editorial office for Low German at its broadcasting centre in SchleswigHolstein has an exchange programme with the University of Hamburg, and in winter
semester 2012/13 a journalist from the central editorial office is teaching a course at the
university on aspects of Low German radio features (Vom ‚Theater im Dunkeln‘ zum
Podcast – Aspekte des Niederdeutschen Hörspiels).

m. Article 12 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to ensure that the
bodies responsible for organizing or supporting cultural activities make appropriate
allowance for incorporating the knowledge and use of the Low German language and
culture (Nos. 494 – 495).
The Ohnsorg-Theater, which moved into its new, larger and technically well-equipped
home at Heidi-Kabel-Platz 1 in August 2011, receives annual funding of € 1,880,000.
During its latest season, the theatre put on 303 evening performances and 90 matinees
in Low German. About 141,000 spectators visited the shows. The theatre also staged
130 performances while on tour, with a special emphasis on the urban periphery.

64
Starting with the 2012/13 season, the new studio stage is being used for children's
theatre in Low German. The first play (Lütt Aant – Ente, Tod und Tulpe) is being
performed bilingually, so that young audiences can follow the story without difficulty and
gain exposure to Low German in an entertaining way. Performances are accompanied
by theatre education offerings.
The 2012/2013 season marks the start of a collaboration between the Ohnsorg-Theater
and the Oldenburg state theatre, with a guest production, Die Wanze (The bug), an
"insect detective story" in High and Low German.
In addition to the Ohnsorg-Theater, the organization Die Wendeltreppe, founded in 1946,
offers regular performances of cabaret, music and literature also in Low German.
Hamburg's cultural authorities provide support for this organization in the form of a small
annual budget for advertising.
The commercial theatre Hamburger Engelsaal, which receives a total of € 50,000,
occasionally offers Low German performances, as do a number of amateur theatre
companies which cultivate the Low German language, such as the Lohbrügger
Bürgerbühne, Henneberg Bühne, De Nedderdütsche, Volksbühne Rissen,
Amateurtheater Duvenstedt, Volksbühne Jenfeld, and Hans Sachs Bühne, among
others.

n. Article 12 (1) (f)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to encourage direct
participation by representatives of the users of Low German in providing facilities and
planning cultural activities (Nos. 496 – 498).
Representatives of the authorities and of users of Low German are in regular contact
with regard to facilities and planning cultural activities.

o. Article 13 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the German authorities to provide
specific information on other measures taken to facilitate and/or encourage the use of
Low German in economic and social life (Nos. 503 – 504).
In April 2012, the Hamburg public transport network HVV launched an advertising
campaign in Low German on posters, in newspapers and on buses to publicize the
benefits of public transport. The posters displayed a QR code which smartphone users
could use to gain access to a website with the information in High German.

p. Article 13 (2) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to adopt a structured
policy with a view to making more systematic the possibility to be received and treated in
Low German in social care facilities (Nos. 505 – 508).
No structured policy has been adopted for receiving and treating persons in Low German
in social care facilities. Low German is rarely used in client interactions.

65
8. Low German in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
a. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities to clarify, in the next
periodical report, the extent to which Low German is taught in practice at preschools.
The Committee also asked for further information as to whether there is a structured
system which would give parents systematically the option to choose either preschool
education entirely in Low German, or at least a substantial part of it in Low German
(Nos. 512 – 516).
In response to the third evaluation report, starting with the 2009/10 school year the work
of the Low German commissioners in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania concentrated on
preschool education. On the recommendation of the working group on Low German at
school and in early-childhood education (Niederdeutsch in der Schule und in der
frühkindlichen Bildung), a model project was developed to achieve more systematic
teaching of Low German at nursery schools. The Stiftung Mecklenburg foundation
sponsored the model project. In 2010, a variety of materials (books, workbooks, games)
were supplied to all 20 participating nursery schools for teaching Low German. The
project regularly invited all preschool teachers to workshops in 2010 and 2011 to share
experience and gain additional training. In May 2011, a large Low German evaluation
meeting was held at the university of applied sciences in Güstrow, to which nursery
school teachers were invited along with school teachers in order to talk about the
transition from early-childhood to school education. All the teachers agreed that Low
German needs to be more firmly anchored and should have the status of a language of
instruction at school.
The resulting teaching materials represent a key product of the model project and a
milestone for Low German in early-childhood education in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania; these materials are now being used to teach Low German at kindergarten.
The universities of Rostock and Greifswald developed a questionnaire to evaluate the
model project and scientifically assessed the results.

b. Article 8 (1) (b) (iii) and (c) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to pursue their efforts
to ensure that Low German is systematically taught as an integral part of the curriculum
at primary and secondary schools in the territories where Low German is used (Nos. 517
– 522).
Low German is continuously taught in many primary and secondary schools in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. A concrete survey on this issue is planned for
2012/13 as part of Stiftung Mecklenburg's model project on Low German in earlychildhood education and transitions to secondary school (Niederdeutsch in der
frühkindlichen Bildung – Übergänge zur weiterführenden Schule).
No further training for teachers and preschool teachers in certificate courses/subsidiary
courses has taken place since 2009. Seventeen teachers and preschool teachers
completed a Low German language course at the B2 level.
Low German is integrated in German classes. Low German still does not have the status
of a separate subject of instruction in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, so it is not
assigned a specific number of hours of instruction.

66
In practice, there is no supervisory body to ensure that the education offices implement
the administrative regulation on Low German in the classroom (Niederdeutsch in der
Schule). Nor does Low German have the status of a second or third language in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, since it is not a subject of instruction and is thus not
part of the language plan. However, the teachers would welcome this status for Low
German.

c. Article 8 (1) (d) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to include Low
German as an integral part of the curriculum within technical and vocational education
(Nos. 523 – 525).
Low German is integrated in German classes in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
There are no plans to include Low German as an integral part of the curriculum within
technical and vocational education.

d. Article 8 (1) (e) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for more information in the next
periodical report on the suggestion to establish a decentralized Low German master
course and the introduction of a Low German certificate (Nos. 526 – 528).
After attempts to establish Low German within the bachelor and master courses as an
independent subject failed, since 2008/2009 the University of Greifswald has offered the
option to study Low German as a concentration within the teacher training course for
German. Classes offered range from language acquisition to linguistics and literature to
the teaching of Low German. A total of about 40 students will be enrolled in winter
semester 2012/13.
Nor has the University of Rostock succeeded in establishing Low German as an
independent subject, but it has been integrated as individual modules in existing and
planned bachelor, master and teacher training courses. An introductory lecture class on
Low German language and literature is a requirement for teacher candidates. Low
German is offered as a required elective for academic courses.
According to the state ordinance of 16 July 2012 on the first state examination for
teachers at schools of general education and vocational schools in MecklenburgWestern Pomerania, Low German may be studied in the teacher training course as a
subsidiary subject, in derogation from the otherwise customary rules. It is anticipated that
Low German will be established on this basis as a subsidiary subject at both universities.
The decentralized master course and certificate in Low German are the subject of
intense discussion and planning in which the universities of Greifswald, Hamburg, Kiel,
Magdeburg, Oldenburg and Rostock are all involved. Now that a task force specifically
set up for this purpose has met several times, initial ideas for the decentralized master
course and the certificate have been developed. They are to be presented in 2013 and
implemented at the participating universities as soon as possible.

e. Article 10 (1) (a) (v)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
resolute action to establish a structured policy for making it possible to use Low German
in dealings with the administration (Nos. 534 – 536).

67
Because the Charter directly protects Low German as a regional language, the Low
German language in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania is regarded as a possible second
language in the administration. There are no known cases of the justice administration
rejecting Low German documents, nor are any cases known in which official
correspondence has been written in Low German.
The Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state parliament submitted a minor interpellation
in Low German to the state government in 2012.

f. Article 10 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for more information on whether the
administrative authorities continued to draft documents in Low German (Nos. 537 – 538).
The administrative authorities have not drafted any additional documents in Low German
since the last report was produced.

g. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for specific information concerning
compliance with requests for appointment in the territory where Low German is used
(Nos. 539 – 541).
No requests were submitted for appointment in the territory where Low German is used.

h. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to promote the
broadcasting of Low German programmes by private broadcasters (Nos. 542 – 545).
State-wide private broadcasters offer no specific programmes for regional and minority
languages, although they occasionally focus on Low German and selected related
topics.

i. Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities to include specific
information in the next periodical report as to whether existing measures for financial
assistance had been applied also to audiovisual productions in Low German (Nos. 549 –
550).
The state government of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania continues to represent its
position of not providing state financial assistance for specific minority programmes.
Support for Low German productions is possible as part of Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania's cultural film promotion. However, no applications for such funding have
been submitted.

j. Article 12 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
proactive measures to foster access in Low German to works produced in other
languages (Nos. 551 – 553).
No applications for funding have been submitted. However, funding is possible according
to the directive on the allocation of grants in the cultural field (Richtlinie über die
Gewährung von Zuwendungen im kulturellen Bereich) and according to Section 96 of the
Federal Expellees Act (BVFG).

68
k. Article 13 (2) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to adopt a structured
policy with a view to making more systematic the possibility for the persons concerned to
be received and treated in Low German in social care facilities (Nos. 558 – 561).
The authorities have no information in this regard.

9. Low German in Lower Saxony
a. Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to systematically
favour and/or encourage the provision of at least a substantial part of preschool
education in Low German to at least to those pupils whose families so request and
whose number is considered sufficient (Nos. 565 – 567).
Please see the comments on Article 8 (1) (a) (iv) Chapter E. II. 5. a.

b. Article 8 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the German authorities to
provide more specific information in the next periodical report on the extent to which the
teaching of the history and the culture which is reflected by Low German is ensured in
practice (Nos. 571 – 573).
For all types of schools, the core curriculum for the individual subjects of instruction
provide for including the regional context when planning lessons. According to the
decree on the region and its languages (Die Region und ihre Sprachen), the regional
context is to be taken into account in school curriculum, especially in the subjects
German, history, geography, biology, music and art.

c. Article 10 (1) (a) (v) and (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the authorities to ensure that
users of Low German may validly submit documents in Low German within its
administrative districts to the administrative authorities of Lower Saxony (Nos. 578 –
582). The authorities were also told to encourage the national administrative authorities
to draft documents in Low German and take certain measures for the practical
implementation of the undertaking (Nos. 583 – 585).
The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is directly applicable law, so
no further legislation is needed to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents
in Low German. In the same way, users of Low German are quite free to validly submit
documents in Low German.

d. Article 10 (2) (a)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts recommended further improving the use of
Low German in regional or local authorities (Nos. 586 – 589).
In general, it should be noted that Low German is used in many communities. There are
numerous authorities in the relevant geographical areas that have staff who speak Low
German and use it depending on the situation. Staff who speak Low German are
assigned especially to the public information services. A large number of registry offices

69
in Lower Saxony will conduct weddings or register same-sex partnerships in Low
German on request. Some local governments have commissioners for Low German.
Low German is regularly used in general oral communications with government agencies
(such as the police), depending on the region and the interlocutors involved. This is true
above all for local organizational units which interact with the public to a large degree.
Particularly in rural areas, informal communication in Low German plays an important
role in building trust, among other things.
The efforts of the Ostfriesische Landschaft to promote the use of Low German in public
administration in Ostfriesland with its Plattdütskbüro deserve special mention.

e. Article 10 (2) (b), (c), (d) and (e)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts found a clear necessity to establish a
statutory right to ensure the possibility for users of Low German to submit oral or written
applications in this language (Nos. 590 – 592). In addition, it said that a structured policy
was needed to encourage local and regional authorities to publish documents in Low
German (Nos. 593 – 595) and to encourage regional authorities to use Low German in
their debates (Nos. 596 – 597).
Given the right of local self-government, the state government is not allowed to set rules
for the use of Low German in local administration. The European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages has the status of law, so local governments are bound by its
provisions when performing their tasks.
The local governments are aware of the need to enable the use of Low German in
dealings with public administration.

f. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to investigate how
existing Low German programmes could be broadcast on a regular basis (Nos. 605 –
608).
NDR offers a variety of television programmes in Low German. It has steadily expanded
its Low German programming over the years.
The regional programmes from the NDR state broadcasting centres (Hallo
Niedersachsen and Niedersachsen 18:00, Hamburg Journal and Hamburg Journal 18:00
Uhr, Nordmagazin and Land und Leute from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,
Schleswig-Holstein Magazin and Schleswig-Holstein 18:00) provide up-to-date coverage
of Low German topics and events. Features and news are also produced and broadcast
in Low German. Content ranges from state and local politics to culture and education as
well as science, research and society. In addition, regularly scheduled programmes and
specials are broadcast in Low German.

g. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to promote
audiovisual works in Low German (Nos. 609 – 610).
In principle, Lower Saxony welcomes appropriate applications for funding. The
representatives of the interests of the relevant actors are welcome to apply for the
funding indicated. Like every form of state aid, funding for Low German broadcasting
must be applied for and therefore requires interested parties to take the initiative.

70
In 2010, the nordmedia fonds GmbH provided funding for the NDR documentary in Low
German, Bingo – Toletzt entscheed jümmers das Glück.

h. Article 12 (1) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
proactive measures to foster the different means of access in other languages to works
produced in Low German (Nos. 611 – 612).
The Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache in Bremen provides support for promotion in this
area. The state of Lower Saxony provides about € 127,000 in annual support.
In 2010, the Oldenburgische Landschaft organized the project PLATTart-Festival für
Neue Niederdeutsche Kultur, an art festival for new Low German culture, with funding
from the state of Lower Saxony. The festival was intended to demonstrate that Low
German is up to date and has great potential for modern forms of expression. Over nine
days, nearly 30 events focusing especially on children and young people as their target
audience took place across the entire Oldenburg region. The programme included
concerts, plays, readings, presentations of children's works, a choir festival, an
advanced training course for teachers (Wöör mit Kulöör) and open-air activities. A
festival highlight was the PLATTgold gala evening at the Staatstheater Oldenburg.
PLATTart is a collaboration between the Oldenburgische Landschaft as organizer and
the Staatstheater Oldenburg, which is responsible for the artistic content.

i. Article 12 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to take
proactive measures to foster access in Low German to works produced in other
languages (Nos. 613 – 614).
Many Low German theatres stage works not originally written in Low German. Especially
the higher quality theatres (in particular those theatres that belong to the
Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund Niedersachsen/Bremen) put on a large number of
translated works. Lower Saxony provides annual financial assistance to the
Niederdeutscher Bühnenbund under its framework agreement with the Niederdeutscher
Heimatbund.
Two activities in particular should be pointed out: The music competition Platt-Sounds
calls on young music groups to sing in Low German. If the song lyrics are in High
German, the competition offers help with translation. The competition was very
successful in 2011 and 2012. Lower Saxony provides funding for Platt-Sounds in the
framework of the structures of the civic action group Platt is Cool, which is sponsored by
various regional associations.
The state museum in Hanover has added an audioguide in Low German for its picture
gallery: The texts were translated from High German into Low German and recorded by
NDR announcers. Lower Saxony has helped pay for the costs of translation. The project
has not yet been completed.

Low German in Schleswig-Holstein

a. Article 8 (1) (b) (iii) and (c) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts strongly urged the German authorities to
make available Low German teaching as an integral part of the curriculum throughout
the Low German speaking territory (Nos. 625 – 628).
The state government of Schleswig-Holstein currently has no plans to introduce Low
German as a regular subject of instruction.

b. Article 8 (1) (h)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities for more information in
the next periodical report on further training and continuing education for teachers of Low
German (No. 633).
The state's expert adviser at the institute for advanced teacher training at SchleswigHolstein's schools (IQSH) recruited new expert advisers and outside experts to teach the
further training courses in order to do justice to the focus on language acquisition in the
training courses. However, it is also important to utilize existing specialists and motivate
them to teach Low German. Increasing attention is being paid to extending this further
training to as many regions as possible. This is already happening through collaboration
among the district expert advisers, for example those in the districts of Stormarn, the
Duchy of Lauenburg and the Hanseatic City of Lübeck (joint Low German days; the
district expert advisers provide mutual support with further training; etc.). For the 2012/13
school year the state expert adviser is also conducting a certificate course in Low
German. This course is aimed at teachers at all types of school who understand Low
German and want to increase their speaking skills and knowledge of the Low German
language, literature and culture. A certificate is awarded for successful participation in
the course, which is made up of several components. After completing the course,
teachers are expected to act as multipliers, assist colleagues, help organize the reading
context and teach Low German. The further training courses are listed in the IQSH
catalogue and teachers can register for them online.
In addition, the state centres for Low German in Ratzeburg and Leck perform diverse
and valuable service as venues for basic and further training:


They offer events, further training and advising for advisers, teachers, instructors,
education specialists from day-care centres and volunteers in preschools and
schools.



The centres provide each of these target groups with literature, media and
materials for classroom use, gathered in special age-specific book crates that can
be used outside the centres as well.



At the centres for Low German, teachers work with the director to develop their
own classroom materials; they also receive assistance and make contact with
speakers of Low German.



The six-day qualification course Platt för de Lütten at the Centre for Low German
in Leck is aimed at teachers and education specialists from day-care centres.
The first time this course was offered in 2011, 24 education specialists enrolled.
Non-native speakers of Low German learn about the history of the language,

72
basic grammar and vocabulary, texts, textbooks and practical exercises. The
course receives EU funding (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development).
The project is organized by the local government of the region Mittleres
Nordfriesland.
In addition, various providers such as associations and clubs offer many further training
courses. The IQSH website for school subjects lists all further training courses and has
teaching materials available for download free of charge; it also has links to other
websites that may be helpful in promoting Low German at school. From February to
August 2011, the IQSH counted 91 participants in twelve further training courses on Low
German.
The Schleswig-Holstein Heimatbund (SHHB) focuses much of its attention on the issue
of Low German at school. This association devoted to local and regional language and
culture serves as a point of contact for information on Low German at school; it also
hosts further training for teachers. The SHHB library lends textbooks and specialist
books on request. The SHHB works closely with the centres for Low German and with
the state commissioner for Low German in the schools. It also works with the Low
German task force of the international learning centre Jugendhof Scheersberg and takes
part in the annual theatre workshops Niederdeutsche Theaterwerkstatt für Kinder,
Warksteed för Plattdüütsch Theater and Niederdeutsche Spielgruppentreffen.
The Centre for Low German in the Schleswig region works with the Low German task
force of the international learning centre Jugendhof Scheersberg and also takes part in
the annual theatre workshops Niederdeutsche Theaterwerkstatt für Kinder, Warksteed
för Plattdüütsch Theater and Niederdeutsche Spielgruppentreffen (Kinderblock am
Sonnabendvormittag). An Internet platform with teaching materials is planned.
The information system of the Centre for Low German in the Holstein region (newsletter,
PLATTNET web directory and news) delivers information, suggestions for classroom
activities and possibilities for participating in Low German cultural activities to interested
parties.

c. Article 8 (2)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for more information on the
educational concepts and their practical implementation in environments where Low
German is no longer an actively spoken language (Nos. 638 – 640).
In the area of adult education, adult education centres, which receive institutional
funding from the state of Schleswig-Holstein, offer language classes in Low German.
Continuing education providers and institutions are free to choose which classes they
offer. The Continuing Education Act gives them the right to design their curriculum and
programmes autonomously. Statewide, nearly 30 adult education centres offer about 60
classes in Low German; with total enrolment of 620, these classes are quite popular.
Enrolment is up about 25% since 2007.
Low German is also part of the continuing education provided by Schleswig-Holstein's
adult education centres for nursery school staff (KiTa Weiterbildungsprogramm). The
state association of adult education centres in Schleswig-Holstein and the SHHB have
set up a joint working group to develop curriculum for a course on becoming a guide to
regional history and culture, with a special focus on Low German.

73
The centres for Low German in the Schleswig region (Leck) and the Holstein region
(Ratzeburg) are also the first points of contact for the area of early childhood education.
They advise and organize further training for specialist nursery school staff.

d. Article 10 (1) (a) (v)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts reminded the authorities that apart from
adopting administrative regulations, they could envisage other measures to make it
possible to use Low German in dealings with the administration (Nos. 641 – 644).
The state of Schleswig-Holstein believes that it is not necessary to adopt administrative
regulations to fulfil the undertaking, as the Charter constitutes directly enforceable law in
Germany. No further measures have been taken.

e. Article 10 (1) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities not only to allow
documents to be drafted in Low German, but also to take certain measures to implement
the undertaking in practice (Nos. 645 – 647).
The state of Schleswig-Holstein believes that the provision does not require any further
measures beyond allowing documents to be drafted in Low German.

f. Article 10 (2) (b)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts called on the authorities to encourage
speakers of Low German to make use of the language in communicating with the
regional and municipal authorities (Nos. 648 – 650).
However, the state of Schleswig-Holstein is of the view that the undertaking only
requires “allowing”, not measures to “encourage”, the speakers to make use of the
language in communicating with the authorities.

g. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
ensure compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of Low German to be appointed in the territory in which that
language is used (Nos. 651 – 653).
No such requests have yet been made in Schleswig-Holstein. Nor can any be expected,
as Low German is spoken throughout the entire state. In addition, the state points out
that, when hiring public service staff, the principle of achievement as referred to in Article
33 (2) of the Basic Law is to be taken into account; thus knowledge of regional or
minority languages may be used as a special selection criterion only for specific
vacancies for which this criterion must be met. This is not the case for training vacancies
in the general public administration or for junior managers to be hired for any ministry.

h. Article 11 (1) (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to promote the
broadcasting of Low German programmes by private broadcasters, for example using
financial incentives (Nos. 659 – 662).
The Open Channel of Schleswig-Holstein has a great many activities in Low German. In
addition to various editorial desks in the Open Channel radio stations in Lübeck and

74
Heide, both Open Channel television stations in Kiel and Flensburg regularly record and
broadcast plays in Low German.

i. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities to include in the next
periodical report information about measures aimed at encouraging and/or facilitating the
production of audio and audiovisual works in Low German (Nos. 663 – 664).
The Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein GmbH, which in principle could provide
funding for audio and audiovisual works, did not provide any funding for Low German
films, as no funding applications were submitted.

j. Article 12 (1) (b) and (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to elaborate
more in detail on their role in the translation of Low German works and the translation of
works in other languages into Low German (Nos. 667 – 669).
The state of Schleswig-Holstein provides institutional funding for the Niederdeutscher
Bühnenbund Schleswig-Holstein e.V. and the Landesverband der Amateurtheater
Schleswig-Holstein e.V., thereby supporting their work as umbrella organizations. They
provide services and advice for their member theatres and help them in planning their
performance schedules. This involves not only staging existing works for the theatre, but
also commissioning new Low German translations of dramatic works in High German
and putting these on the stage.

k. Article 13 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the authorities to provide more
information on the measures taken to encourage and/or facilitate the use of Low German
in economic and social activities (Nos. 674 – 675).
The state of Schleswig-Holstein sees few possibilities for government influence in the
area of economic and social activities.

l. Article 13 (2) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to include in the next
periodical report information about measures to ensure that speakers of Low German
can be received and treated in Low German in social care facilities (Nos. 676 – 679).
In this area too, the possibilities for government influence are limited, as most retirement
and nursing homes are privately owned and operated. However, the state government of
Schleswig-Holstein continues to do everything within its power and in cooperation with
the relevant associations and institutions to strengthen the use of Low German.

11.

Romani in Hesse

a. Article 8 (1) (a) - (e), (1) (f) (iii), (1) (h) and (2)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the Hessian authorities to


provide more specific information regarding the presence of Romani in education
at all levels in the next periodical report (Nos. 686 – 688);

75


strengthen their efforts to encourage the offering of Romani as a subject of adult
education (Nos. 689 – 690);



provide information about any teacher training for Romani language education
(Nos. 691 – 693); and



provide information on educational concepts and their practical implementation in
environments where Romani is not an actively spoken language, in particular on
the protection and promotion of Romani in the Frankfurt area (Nos. 697 – 699).

Implementation is delayed due to the ongoing discussions among German Sinti and
Roma about the approach to opening the Romani language. For example, the Romani
language course offered at the adult education centre in Marburg did not take place
because the ethnic group did not reach agreement about whether non-native speakers
and non-Sinti should be allowed to attend so that no one enrolled in the course.
For the same reason, it is very difficult to introduce Romani language courses at schools.
In addition, the implementation of the Charter is complicated by the fact that Romani
spoken by German Sinti and Roma does not have a standardized written form and that
the minority regards it as a kind of ‘insider language’ which is not to be taught by national
institutions. However, this would be necessary to provide language instruction at public
schools subject to government supervision. It has to be concluded that teaching in
Romani so far has not been promoted at Hessian schools and that progress within the
meaning of the Charter seems very unlikely as such action is neither practicable nor
wished for by the minority concerned.
This is also the reason for the lack of well-trained teachers and of teaching material
accepted by the regional associations and the Central Council. However, some of the
pupils from the ethnic group of Sinti and Roma who will take their Abitur exams at
Hessian schools will probably go through university teacher training and become
teachers with Romani language skills.
Pupils from the majority population are increasingly aware of the Romani language
because the history and culture of the Sinti and Roma is taught during teacher training
and in history classes. In this context, important work is done by the project office for
national minorities (Pädagogische Büro Nationale Minderheiten: Sinti und Roma). In the
framework of a cooperation scheme between the University of Marburg and the Hessian
Ministry of Culture, it offers seminars on the history and culture of the Sinti and Roma
and other minorities for students training to become teachers.
Although Hessian universities do not offer Romani courses as such, Giessen University
notes that numerous Romani expressions are used in the language of Spanish youths.
These expressions and their origin are discussed during courses on Spanish
sociolinguistics.

b. Article 9 (1) (b) (iii) and (c) (iii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts recommended that the German authorities
take resolute action to establish a structured policy for making it possible in practice to
use Romani in the courts (Nos. 700 – 701).
This is an issue of the (still not available) interpreters. In order to provide official
interpreters, the language must be codified to allow verification. As long as this is not
granted, implementing this undertaking is very difficult.

76
c. Article 10 (3) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts reminded the German authorities to make it
possible to use regional or minority languages in dealings with the administration for
those who so wish, in order for the undertaking to be fulfilled (Nos. 705 – 707).
Romani speakers so far have not expressed their wish to use Romani in dealings with
the administration. On the contrary: they refuse to communicate in Romani outside their
families. Therefore, there are no reports about a violation of this undertaking.

d. Article 10 (4) (c)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities to strengthen
their efforts to have some Romani speakers among their employees (Nos. 708 – 709).
All jobs are available also for speakers of the Romani language. The General Equal
Treatment Act (AGG), which also affects private contract law, can be used to counter
discrimination against ethnic groups. The act provides that no one must be refused
employment because of his/her ethnic origin. A person who is nevertheless
discriminated against may sue for damages. Discrimination by public authorities is ruled
out by Article 3 of the Basic Law which prohibits unequal treatment because of
parentage or race.

e. Article 11 (1) (b) (ii) and (c) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts urged the authorities to take measures to
encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio and television programmes in
Romani on a regular basis (Nos. 711 – 716).
On the basis of German constitutional law, no government may determine programming
content. Thus Hesse has no way to exert influence on the design or selection of
programmes. However, Hesse has informed the broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk
about Germany’s obligations and initiated a dialogue between the state public service
broadcasting corporation and the Hessian Association of German Sinti and Roma, while
respecting the constitutional principle of government non-intervention in broadcasting.
However, according to our information, representatives of the Sinti and Roma have not
asked the state public service broadcasting corporation for any programming in the
Romani language.

f. Article 11 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for information on whether audio and
audiovisual works in Romani are actually produced and how their production and
distribution is encouraged and/or facilitated (Nos. 717 – 719).
Press law governing press companies and their members does not give governments
the authority to take action in this field. The production of audio and audiovisual works is
in the hands of the regional association of the Sinti and Roma. The association has
produced works using the funds provided by the state government. In addition, during
the last ten years, no applications have been filed for film funding from the Hessen Film
Fund (Hessische Filmförderung), and therefore films have not been produced during that
time.

77
g. Article 11 (1) (e) (i) and (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the authorities, in cooperation
with the Romani-speakers, to overcome the existing obstacles due to the absence of a
standard written form of Romani and the wish of some of the speakers not to make
written materials in Romani publicly accessible (Nos. 720 – 721).
Approaches to solve this issue have been discussed with the regional association of the
German Sinti and Roma.

h. Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities to provide information
on the application of existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual
productions in Romani (Nos. 722 – 723).
Interesting stories may receive funding from the Hessen Film Fund. Producing a film in
the Romani language would also be possible.

i. Article 11 (1) (g)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked the authorities for specific information
on training programmes of the Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma (Nos. 726 –
727).
In 2010 the Rhein-Necker Chamber of Industry and Commerce recognized the
Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma as a training company.
Since September the centre has been offering one apprenticeship position for office
assistants. From January 2013 the centre will participate in the European Voluntary
Service for Young People. The programme aims at training and qualifying in particular
Roma from eastern Europe through a study or professional training visit of up to one
year abroad, thus improving their chances on the labour market. In addition, it is planned
to establish and promote an academy and a professional training network to ensure
sustainability in the field of education and training. At the moment, the centre does not
have the necessary funds.

j. Article 12 (1) (a)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the authorities to provide
information on the extent to which the Documentation and Cultural Centre supported by
the authorities encourages types of expression and initiatives specific to Romani and
fosters the access to works produced in Romani (Nos. 724 – 725).
The German authorities would like to ask the Committee of Experts to respect the wish
of the members of the Sinti and Roma minority, and in particular of the Holocaust
survivors, to not disclose their language – the German Romani – to outsiders.
In dealing with the language, the centre follows a “from Sinti for Sinti” approach.
Seminars with selected participants address the language, its way of expression, its use
and its cultivation. In 2011 the centre published an article about literary works and
storytelling of German Sinti and Roma which is also distributed in Romani among the
minority members.
The documentation centre engages in an exchange with the regional associations of the
Central Council of German Sinti and Roma which are also involved in language

78
preservation. So far, the project that reached the largest audience was a one-hour
broadcast of the Hessian regional association in cooperation with a private broadcaster.
Romani is also used in homework assistance and accompanied classes. In the area of
music, we would like to point out the Philharmonischer Verein der Sinti und Roma
(philharmonic association of Sinti and Roma) in Frankfurt which promotes the reputation
and dissemination of the minority’s cultural traditions and thus also pays tribute to the
minority language.
Finally, a written form of Romani in its various dialects is developing on the Internet.
Since most participants in chat rooms and forums are young Sinti and Roma who want
to use their language beyond everyday conversation, this might be a fruitful basis for an
intensive language cultivation pointing to the future.

k. Article 12 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts pointed out to the Hessian authorities that
cultural activities of Roma and Sinti associations must be supported or that they must be
involved in such activities. According to the Committee, this undertaking refers also to
bodies whose role is to organize or support various cultural activities. These bodies
should give sufficient importance in their programmes to the knowledge and use of the
Romani language and the culture it represents (Nos. 728 – 729).
Subject to available funds, the state government also supports cultural events of Sinti
and Roma if they applied for funding and the project is considered suitable. Funding of
cultural events of Sinti and Roma also encompasses the Romani language and the
culture it represents.
For example, Hesse supports the international Roma philharmonic orchestra in
Frankfurt.
One example for how Sinti and Roma are involved in cultural events is the joint concert
of musicians of the Roma philharmonic orchestra and the orchestra of the Gymnasium
Philippinum in Marburg in 2010. Pupils and Roma musicians played together, and the
role of Sinti and Roma music in classical music was discussed in an accompanying
presentation. The concert was funded by the university city of Marburg. A larger joint
concert of this kind is planned in 2013.
Since Sinti and Roma were also among the groups persecuted by the Nazi regime, in
recent years the Hessian state agency for civic education has organized several events
on this issue, e.g.:
2006: Presentation by Dr Florian Freund on the persecution of gypsies in Austria (during
the study tour “Österreich unter dem Hakenkreuz” [Austria under the Swastika])
2008: “Zigeunerbilder” in Schule und Unterricht (the image of gypsies at school and in
classroom instruction), Hessian Association of German Sinti and Roma; exhibition and
side programme, Darmstadt
2010: “Frankfurt – Auschwitz”, Förderverein Roma e. V., exhibition and side programme,
Frankfurt
2012: “Frankfurt–Auschwitz”, Förderverein Roma e. V., exhibition and side programme,
Bad Homburg

79
Informing the majority population about the history of persecution and the cultural
expression of Sinti and Roma from the Early Modern Age until today is the aim of the
publication “Antiziganismus in der Geschichte” – “Zigeunerbilder”: Ursachen, Nutzen,
Folgen, Auswirkungen auf Nicht-Sinti/Roma und Sinti und Roma (the history of antigypsyism – the image of gypsies: reasons, advantages, consequences, impact on nonSinti/non-Roma and Sinti and Roma) – which will be published in spring 2013 by the
Hessian Ministry of Culture to complement existing education standards. The publication
is intended to inform and make the majority population aware of the minority across all
subjects, school types and grades.
It will be presented during a ceremony hosted by the city and university of Marburg to
commemorate the 70th anniversary of the deportation of Sinti and Roma to the death
camps; the orchestra of the Gymnasium Philippinum directed by Riccardo M. Sahiti will
accompany the ceremony.
On 29 November 2012, the “Requiem für Auschwitz” directed by Riccardo M. Sahiti
premiered in Germany at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt. Young people recited
autobiographical accounts of survivors in a multimedia installation. In the evening, the
exhibition “Frankfurt – Auschwitz” of the Förderverein Roma e.V. and the artist Bernd
Rausch was presented in the foyer of the opera house.

l. Article 12 (2)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts asked for more specific information on the
promotional concepts and their practical implementation in the field of cultural activities
and facilities in urban areas where now there are strong concentrations of Romani
speakers (Nos. 730 – 733).
Hesse does not have promotional concepts specifically for municipalities where there are
many Romani speakers.

m. Article 13 (1) (d)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested the authorities to provide
information in the next periodical report on any further developments in facilitating and
supporting the use of Romani in the context of economic and social activities (Nos. 734 –
735).
We have already pointed out in the last report that the Hessian government provides
institutional funding for the Hessian Association of German Sinti and Roma. Funding is
provided with the aim and expectation that the association will offer advisory services in
Romani for speakers of the national minority language in all social areas.
In its report about the use of the funds it received in 2011, the regional association
stated that “850-900 Hessian Sinti and Roma contacted the representation of the
national minority of Sinti and Roma in Hesse (i.e. the bureau of the regional association)
in 2011. Taking into account the demand as well as legal possibilities and necessities, all
Sinti and Roma were provided with comprehensive advice in all social areas. However,
the association provided not only legal advice but also discussed further steps with the
persons concerned.”
This means that by providing institutional and project funding the Hessian government
has ensured that advisory services can be offered in Romani for speakers of the national
minority language, in particular in dealing with the administration in the fields of

80
school/education, labour/social affairs, housing and childcare. This is important because
members of the national minority often regard public authorities with mistrust given their
history of persecution. In contrast, they trust the staff of the regional association, also
because they provide advice in Romani.
With a view to the fact that there are only about 7,000 members of the national minority
in Hesse it may be assumed that by having responded to 850-900 enquiries, the
association’s advisory service meets the needs of the minority.

n. Article 14 (1) (a)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts requested more detailed information in the
next periodical report on how Germany is applying bilateral and multilateral agreements
with the objective of fostering contacts among Romani speakers in Germany and in other
countries (Nos. 736 – 739).
The Hessian government has no specific information on this issue.

81

12.

Assessments concerning federal authorities or all federal states

a. Cultural policy abroad, Article 12 (3)
In its latest report, the Committee of Experts encouraged the German authorities to
adopt a structured approach in order to make appropriate provision for the regional or
minority languages in their cultural policy abroad.
Deutsche Welle (German International Radio Service), whose programmes are
broadcast in many languages, has posted an atlas on the Internet
(http://www.dw.de/deutsch-lernen/landeskunde/s-12377) which is dedicated to Sater
Frisian and Low German and shows the settlement areas, traditions, language
distribution and particularities. Internet users can listen to audio examples and find
background information regarding Sater Frisian and the forms of Low German spoken in
Hamburg, Mecklenburg, the Niederrhein area, Ostfriesland and Westfalia.
Deutsche Welle produces a weekly 15-minute magazine in Romani, which is broadcast
on Sundays from 12:30 to 12:45 and is repeated on Mondays.
Other than the measures taken by Deutsche Welle, the Federal Foreign Office does not
support any measures taken to promote the cultural relations and education policy
abroad. The German authorities uphold their view that the implementation of Article
12 (3) of the Language Charter does not necessarily have to involve the Federal Foreign
Office and its cultural relations and education policy abroad.

b. Effective monitoring mechanism in the field of education, Article 8 (1) (i)
In its latest report, the Committee of Ministers recommended that the German authorities
ensure that an effective monitoring mechanism exists in the field of education for all
regional or minority languages covered under Part III.
Cf. the statements under D. VI.
In addition, the state of Lower Saxony provided information concerning the decree "Die
Region und ihre Sprachen" (The Region and its Languages), which took effect on
1 August 2011 and governs the establisment of a school supervisory body.
North Rhine-Westphalia has not signed Part III of the Charter; however it has begun to
introduce a monitoring mechanism. At present, the Ministry of Schools and Further
Education is drafting a school project on Low German, which is currently under review
and is designed to establish Low German as an independent subject in the medium
term, possibly in the lower secondary grades, too. As regards universities, however, Low
German is primarily dealt with from the research perspective.

82

III. Summary
The competent authorities at the federal and state level have taken up the
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers and of the Committee of Experts as
regards the Fourth Report of the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with Article
15 (1) of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The federal
authorities, in cooperation with the states and the representatives of the language
groups, took further efforts in the period under review in order to fulfil the undertakings
under the Charter. These efforts will be continued in the future.

83

F. Comments by the associations
The Federal Ministry of the Interior gave the representatives of the language groups the
opportunity to make comments - orally, on the occasion of a joint conference, and in
writing - on the Fifth Report of the Federal Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany in line with Article 15 (1) of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages. Most of the oral comments have been incorporated in the report; the written
comments are as follows:

I. Comments by the Sinti Allianz Deutschland
Culture and language
The Sinti Allianz Deutschland seeks to preserve and maintain not only its German
culture but also the cultural heritage of the Sinti.
Preserving the Sinti culture and language in the private sphere is particularly important in
this context. A long-standing binding order requires Sinti families to hand on the history,
culture, language and values to the coming generations orally.
Using our language and culture at public schools, making it the subject of a university
course or using it in the media would represent a serious violation of the cultural laws of
the Sinti community.
This is why we reject all government measures in this field which intrude on the private
nature of Sinti culture and language, such as those required by the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages.
In spite of the taboos with regard to written Romani and the special position of the
families within the Sinti culture, the Sinti Allianz has realized that Sinti communities need
to open up softly and the Sinti culture needs to be presented to a certain degree in the
socio-cultural environment if prejudices are to be overcome and social and cultural
participation is to be achieved. Particular reference should be made here to the Sinti
radio programme "Latscho Dibes" (Good day), which was launched in 2000 by the
association Hildesheimer Sinti e.V., a member of the Sinti-Allianz e.V. It seeks to
familiarize the German majority population with the Sinti culture in an effort to replace
hostile sterotypes with positive attitudes.
The motto is togetherness instead of contrariness.
On 23 May 2005, the then Federal Minister of the Interior Otto Schily honoured the
association Hildesheimer Sinti e.V. for the radio programme "Latscho Dibes" and
declared it the 2005 Ambassador for Tolerance, an honour reserved for groups and
individuals who fight with creativity and vigour against xenophobia and for democracy.
Regrettably, the "Latscho Dibes" radio editorial team, which has been operating since
2000, has not received any public funding as yet.
Reference should also be made to the 13th Hildesheim Sinti music festival, which is
scheduled to take place in Hildesheim in 2013. It will be organized by Hildesheimer Sinti
e.V. and the Lower Saxony regional association of the Sinti Allianz Deutschland, and will
help to present the Sinti culture and language in spite of the above-mentioned taboos.
The funding of the 2014 festival and that for later years is not secured; financial support
is needed, however.

84
Regrettably, the Lower Saxon Ministry for Scientific and Cultural Affairs has announced
that state grants will have to be stopped after the 2013 festival.
Sinti and Roma?
It is important to note that the term "German Sinti and Roma" does not stand for a single
national minority; rather, the German Sinti and the German Roma belong to two different
ethnic groups with different languages, cultures and legal systems,
and different historic roots and values, which translate into different needs.
This needs to be taken into account to do justice to the identity of German Sinti and
German Roma. Sinti have lived in Germany for over 600 years. The town of Hildesheim
plays an important role in the history of Sinti in Germany: The Sinti were first mentioned
in the historical record in Hildesheim in 1407, where they were referred to in an invoice
from a wine office.
German-born Sinti are subject to orders and prohibitions unknown to Roma, to whom
different cultural orders and laws apply. The two groups also have opposing views on
language instruction: Whereas Roma accept state-sponsored instruction in Romany, the
Sinti consider this to be a serious violation of their community’s cultural taboos.
If you want to pay equal respect to either group, their different names need to be
referred to in all cases where it is deemed necessary to mention the ethnic origin. There
are more than 150,000 Sinti in Germany, making it one of the sizeable minority groups.
Owing to past political decisions they receive hardly any financial assistance to promote
their traditions and their culture - a situation which needs urgent remedy. To date, most
of the work is done by honorary workers. This is not enough, however, because qualified
support and work is involved, in particular with the future-oriented activities in the
communities on the ground, and child and youth work. Financial assistance is urgently
needed to secure the future of the coummunities, overcome social disadvantages and
establish child and youth work.

II. Comments by the Central Council and the Documentation Centre of
German Sinti and Roma
Traditionally, the Sinti and Roma families speak Romani as a second native language
alongside German. Romani does not exist in writing and has been handed down orally
over centuries. The Romani dialect spoken by German Sinti and Roma differs from other
Romani dialects spoken elsewhere in Europe, although all are derived from ancient
Indian Sanskrit. They have a common core vocabulary which indicates Sanskrit, Persian,
Armenian and Greek origins. Romani and Sanskrit grammar have many close links. In
the past, those members of the majority population who did research on the Romani
language often did so in an effort to discredit the minority. Almost all linguistic literature
reflected negative "gipsy stereotypes". Finally, the National Socialist regime sought to kill
all Sinti and Roma and eradicate their culture. The overwhelming number of older
members of the minority group were actually murdered, taking with them a great deal of
linguistic knowledge. In 1936, the SS mandated the so-called race researchers of the
Third Reich to register all Sinti and Roma. They learned their language in an effort to
gain their confidence and gather useful information about them on the basis of which
they were later deported to the ghettoes and destruction camps in occupied Poland.

85
It is against this backdrop that most of the Sinti and Roma, in particular Holocaust
survivors, refuse to share their language with persons not belonging to their groups. This
is a stance the Central Council and its associated members cannot and will not
disrespect.
That said, preserving and maintaining the German Romani language is part of the
associaton's policy and is conveyed as part of the education and cultural work within the
minority group. Information about the minority's history and about its language is passed
on to an interested audience in lectures and publications - most recently at a meeting on
minority and regional languages organized by the Institute for Sorbian Language and
Culture of Leipzig University in December 2012, or in the book "Neben Deutsch. Die
autochthonen Minderheiten- und Regionalsprachen Deutschlands" (Alongside German.
The autochthonous minority and regional languages in Germany) published in 2009. The
language and linguistic work is dealt with internally, by Sinti and Roma for Sinti and
Roma. The Language Charter and thus the recognition of Romani as a minority
language forms an important framework for the future shape and preservation of the
German Romani language, which young Sinti and Roma use more and more selfassuredly.

The comments by the Sinti and Roma associations of Rhineland-Palatinate and Bavaria
are as follows:
Rhineland-Palatinate state association
The state association, which represents the interests of some 8,000 Sinti and Roma
living in Rhineland-Palatinate, concluded a framework agreement with the regional
government in 2005, enshrining the protection of minorities in a legal instrument
guaranteeing the protection and promotion of the culture of Sinti and Roma.
Rhineland-Palatinate gives financial support to the association's secretariat, thus
supporting its educational and cultural efforts; furthermore it sponsors the volunteer
activities by association members. The association acts as a point of contact for schools
and other educational establishments (state institutions for professional teacher training,
further training for employees of church or social institutions) on all matters concerning
the Sinti and Roma minority groups; it also organizes seminars and specialist
conferences which are to be attended by education multipliers and deal with the
persecution of Sinti and Roma by the National Socialist regime and on the history and
culture of the minority. Units covering Sinti and Roma issues are taught at school. The
prejudices which the majority population holds with regard to the minoriy group of Sinti
and Roma form an intrinsic part of Europe's cultural values, making equal treatment
impossible. For this reason, the association needs to carry out educational work in
schools, with teachers, within teacher training and with public relations multipliers.
The association provided training within the minority group and to promote the Romani
language. Romani language training within the minority group in line with the
requirements of the European Charter of Regional and Minority Languages and the
information of and encounter with the majority population are essential elements to
further the growth of mutual respect between the minority and the majority, which needs
to be supported given the National Socialist persecution of the minority group. This work
has been carried out primarily by voluntary workers. To continue this inter- and
intracultural educational work, the funds necessary to hire a full-time Sinti/Roma official

86
continue to be needed. To this end there were negotiations with the government of
Rhineland-Palatinate, which confirmed its intention to meet the obligations arising from
the framework agreement; however, it refused to fund the full-time position due to budget
restraints, and suggested the identification of alternatives such as model projects in
cooperation with further education institutions. It should be noted, though, that the
educational and cultural work is very important and cannot be carried out by a
combination of voluntary and free-lance work. The association lacks the personnel to
organize the matters involved. Projects need to be accompanied. Also, a full-time and
paid official is needed because voluntary work has been stretched too far for many
years. What is needed is vital start-up and motivation work which cannot be delivered in
a combination of voluntary and free-lance work.
Bavaria state association
On 15 September 2010, Minister-President Horst Seehofer received a delegation of
13 Sinti and Roma Holocaust survivors at the Bavarian state chancellery. The delegation
was led by Romani Rose, head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma, and
Erich Schneeberger, head of the Bavaria state association. They spoke among other
things about representing the minority in the Bavarian regulatory authority for
commercial broadcasting (BLM), a demand made by the Central Council and the state
association. This demand had Minister-President Seehofer's general backing. He
promised to make efforts to ensure that the minority be represented in the regulatory
authority, initially in an advisory capacity. Romani Rose and Erich Schneeberger pointed
out that Sinti and Roma had lived in Bavaria as a minority for over 600 years. Therefore
they should be represented in the public bodies like other socially relevant groups. That
would raise public awareness and responsibility, and counteract prevailing clichés and
prejudices.
On 11 May 2011, Erich Schneeberger, as head of the Bavaria state association of Sinti
and Roma, met with Dr. Erich Jooß, head of the BLM commercial broadcasting
regulatory authority. They agreed that, prior to a proper representation on the regulatory
authority, a representative of our state association should be allowed to attend the BLM
conferences and committee meetings as a "standing observer", and that he or she
should be given access to information about the issues concerning minority protection,
NS persecution etc., and be given the right to speak and make comments. On 5
December 2011, a meeting took place at the Bavarian state chancellery between State
Minister Kreuzer, Dr. Jooß, head of the BLM, Romani Rose, head of the Central Council
of German Sinti and Roma, and Erich Schneeberger, head of the Bavaria state
association, the "possibility of participation in a consultative capacity" was raised. Dr.
Jooß promised that he would discuss the possibilities of participation in the BLM bodies.
A press release dated 19 July 2012 (which was sent to us by Dr. Jooß's office on 20 July
2012) informed us that "Prof. Dr. Manfred Treml, (who represents the Bavarian
Homeland Association on the BLM), had been elected by the BLM commercial
broadcasting regulatory authority on 19 July 2012 to become its minority commissioner".
In a telephone call on 20 July 2012, Erich Schneeberger as the head of the Bavaria state
association told Dr. Jooß that that proposal did not live up to the promises made on
11 May and 5 December 2011. Our association therefore does not consider the
establishment of a minority commissioner who is to serve as a "point of contact for
minorities" an appropriate solution. The German Sinti and Roma demand that they, like
other socially relevant groups, be enabled to present their own concerns in the

87
commercial broadcasting regulatory authority. Erich Schneeberger as the head of the
Bavaria state association urged the regulatory authority to revise its decision without
delay. So far there has not been any response, neither by the Bavarian state
government nor by the BLM commercial broadcasting regulatory authority.

III. Comments by Domowina – Bund Lausitzer Sorben e.V.
1. General remarks
During the reporting period, between the fourth and fifth periodical reports, a
number of language promotion measures were implemented or adopted which
will have a positive effect on the use of the Sorbian language, especially in the
public sector. Special emphasis should be given to the state government of
Saxony's adoption of a catalogue of measures to encourage and revive the use
of the Sorbian language. This catalogue of measures directly addresses those in
positions of responsibility as well as the majority population with specific plans for
participation, thereby encouraging a positive attitude towards the use of the
Sorbian language. Other plans and projects supported by the Federal
Government and the two state governments will encourage positive attitudes
towards the Sorbian language and multilingualism over the long term. In this
context, we should like to emphasize the EUROPEADA 2012 football
championships for speakers of minority languages in Europe, organized by the
Federal Union of European Nationalities (FUEN) and hosted by Domowina in
Lusatia. The following comments therefore address only the points where
Domowina disagrees with the periodical report or where shortcomings have been
found. The procedure for compiling the fourth periodical report, which called for
the representatives of the federal and state authorities to work in parallel with the
representatives of the protected language groups and which we criticized in our
previous comments, was changed for the current report in accordance with our
suggestion. We are pleased to note this change.
2. re Section D
Specific remarks on IV. No. 4
The Free State of Saxony's description of the structure of the education system is
correct. Nonetheless, it should be pointed out that past changes to school structures
also related to local government reforms have led to school closures, changing the
enrolment composition at the remaining schools. As a result, in some cases the
proportion of pupils who are Sorbian native speakers to those who speak only German
has changed to the disadvantage of Sorbian language areas. The 2Plus programme
mentioned by the government of Saxony is intended to remedy this situation by
providing early bilingual preschool education and bilingual instruction at primary level
intended to compensate for differing levels of language skills among pupils. The
evaluation of the 2Plus programme has shown that this situation leads to very different
conditions and results of language acquisition. For this reason, the rigorous measures
proposed to implement a successful 2Plus programme at the two schools which have
introduced it should be taken soon. To do so, the Saxony State Ministry for Education
must enact a supplementary, binding ordinance regarding the work at these two schools.

88
The current ordinance dating from 1992 needs to be revised in view of the 2Plus
programme. It is not currently foreseeable when the Cabinet will take the necessary
action to do so. Until then, it will not be able to improve the available resources, in
particular the provision of qualified Sorbian teachers for bilingual instruction, as
necessary.
3. re Section E. II. 2.
Upper Sorbian in Saxony
Article 8 (1) (b) (iv)
We can largely confirm these statements. They do not refer to the evidence in practice of
deficits among pupils who are Sorbian native speakers when they are a minority in the
classroom. Implementing the measures from the 2Plus programme would compensate
for these deficits. We therefore underscore the need for an ordinance to this effect.
Article 8 (1) (b) (iv), vocational education in Upper Sorbian
The response leads us to believe that there was no concrete investigation as to where
Upper Sorbian could be included in training other than at the Sorbian College for Social
Pedagogy (Sorbische Fachschule für Sozialpädagogik). This should address above all
other services and areas of society where the frequency of contact with Sorbians is
highest. In the Sorbian language area, Sorbian language skills should also be taught in
the tourism industry. The creation of the Lusatian lake district, where many Sorbian
villages were razed to make way for lignite mining, also offers an opportunity in this
regard. With the help of the Sorbian tourism association and the Union of Sorbian
Craftsmen and Businessmen, support for pro-active government measures could be
ensured.
Article 9 (1) (c) (ii)
The rights guaranteed by Section 184 of the Judicature Act are to be upheld also when
courts relocate. One example is the recent relocation of the regional court from
Bautzen/Budy to Görlitz/Zhorjelc, which Domowina objected to in its statement during
the hearings due to fears of this kind. As a result, Section 9 of the Act on the Sorbs'
Rights in the Free State of Saxony was expanded. The practical consequences will
become apparent following upcoming proceedings to be held in Sorbian.
Article 11 (1) (b) (ii)
Commercial radio in Saxony currently has no Sorbian programme. The regional
broadcasters have so far accumulated no resources to do so nor produced any
programmes. On the positive side, at Saxony's training and trial channel, interested
young people in particular have been learning specialized skills to produce radio and
television shows. Sorbian-language programming could also be produced in this way, if
the necessary resources are provided.
Article 11 (1) (f) (ii)
The number of audiovisual products on offer remains quite limited. So the focus on
programmes for children and young people is very welcome. Nonetheless, appropriate
financial resources should be provided in the near term in the form of a permanent
budget for the foundation and additional funding areas for audiovisual products in
Sorbian. We are currently seeking to gain funding for a digital spelling programme in

89
Upper and Lower Sorbian to be available on the Internet. This project has been
postponed for years due to a lack of funding.
4. re Section E. I.
Lower Sorbian in Brandenburg
The state government of Brandenburg does not appear to be taking any measures to
fulfil the undertaking in Article 7 (1) (c) and (d) with regard to Lower Sorbian.
During the reporting period, the Council for Sorbian Affairs at the Brandenburg state
parliament initiated a discussion of amending Brandenburg's Act on the Specification of
the Rights of the Sorbs (Wends) (Sorben-(Wenden-)Gesetz) precisely with reference to
the Language Charter, which was not yet in force in Germany when the current version
of the Act entered into force. The parliament has been discussing the draft amendment
since 2012. In October 2012, the state government produced a report which in fact
contradicts some of the Charter's aims. For example, it refers to the use of Lower
Sorbian as lengthening court proceedings and to technical problems related to using the
language in dealings with the public administration. It is not yet clear which direction the
parliamentary discussion will take. However, the Sorbs/Wends would like the provisions
to be made more specific with regard to the obligations resulting from the Language
Charter. However, the state government and parliament have repeatedly put up
significant resistance, arguing that the undertakings pursuant to Section II of the Charter
are not binding.
With regard to Article 7 (1) (b), we refer to ongoing discussions on territorial restructuring
in the state of Brandenburg. Although the Council for Sorbian Affairs submitted its
comments making explicit reference to the Language Charter, it is not clear to what
extent this aspect has been taken into account. Some of the models proposed raise
fears that the Lower Sorbian language will be further marginalized.
5. re Section E. II. 3.
Lower Sorbian in Brandenburg
Article 8 (1) (a) (iv)
There are currently five different models at ten nursery schools for looking after children
using Lower Sorbian. There are no reliable studies on the effectiveness of the various
models. The network of Lower Sorbian-language offerings cannot be regarded as secure
for the long term due to the current situation with regard to nursery school teachers. The
Oberstufenzentrum in Cottbus offers training opportunities, but the main problem is
medium- and long-term personnel planning by some local providers. Large parts of the
Sorbian/Wendish settlement area do not have any preschool offerings in Lower Sorbian.
Article 8 (1) (b) (iv)
The draft report describes the Witaj project as "basic science classes [Sachunterricht] in
Lower Sorbian". This is incorrect. It is bilingual instruction in specific subjects
[Sachfachunterricht]. Basic science is merely one of the subjects offered.
Apart from the offerings that are available in principle, there are major deficits with
regard to the effectiveness of instruction. The lack of measures of positive discrimination
and the application of general provisions forces primary schools to organize most
instruction for mixed age groups, which makes optional classes even less attractive. The

90
reduction in resources since the 2011/12 school year seems to have further lowered the
attainable language level. For this reason, the Sorbian/Wendish intraschool expert
conference decided in September 2012, for example, that Lower Lusatia (i.e. the primary
schools in Brandenburg offering Lower Sorbian classes) would, after 47 years, no longer
participate in the central Sorbian Olympics.
The responsible Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport initially considered massive cuts
in bilingual education for the 2012/13 school year. Following intensive negotiations, it
was agreed that instruction should first be scientifically assessed before any
organizational, conceptual or legal changes were made.
Regarding the Committee of Expert's recommendations on "structured measures", the
language group can only say that no such measures exist. There are four different
models for the six primary schools offering bilingual instruction. Lost teaching time in
bilingual instruction is a major problem. There is no coordination between foreign
language and bilingual class offerings. Subjects offered in bilingual instruction differ and
depend on the available teachers, who are not properly trained. And bilingual classes
are available only in a small part of the Sorbian/Wendish settlement area.
Article 8 (1) (c) (iv)
The same applies to the "structured measures" as in the area of primary education.
In addition to the offerings mentioned, two secondary schools, in Burg and Cottbus, offer
foreign language classes. Initial planning for bilingual classes at the secondary schools
in Burg and Vetschau is under way.
Article 8 (1) (e) (iii)
Instruction in Lower Sorbian is currently given only outside the state of Brandenburg, at
the University of Leipzig. The facilities there paid for by Brandenburg, above all for
teacher training, are extremely limited. Given the university's discussions over
reorganizing the institute for Sorbian studies (Institut für Sorabistik), it is not clear
whether Brandenburg wants or is able to take measures to fulfil the undertaking in Article
8 (1) (e) (iii).
Article 8 (1) (g)
Regarding the information on offerings at the University of Potsdam: Since winter
semester 2007/08, the University of Potsdam has offered a required optional subject in
the social sciences each semester for students training to be teachers. Regardless of the
specific type of teaching certificate sought (type of school, subjects), students may
choose to take a seminar on topics related to national minorities/regional and minority
languages in Germany/Sorbs/Wends in Brandenburg. So far eleven seminars have been
offered and 210 students have enrolled and assessed the significance of the topic
positively. These seminars are offered as a lectureship funded by the teacher training
centre, organized by the chair for civic education and taught by a former staff member of
the University of Potsdam. They are not sufficiently anchored thematically in the course,
nor do they reach all students in teacher training. In addition to the above-mentioned
seminars, individual classes are offered, for example in the German department, at the
instructors' initiative, in which information about Sorbs/Wends is integrated into classes
on Low German.

91
Brandenburg is to adopt a new law on teacher training in 2012; after Sorbian/Wendish
intervention, the sentence referring to the undertaking from the Language Charter from
the 2007 law was again included in the new draft.
The implementation of the legal obligations to cover the history and culture of the
Sorbs/Wends in the classroom remains unclear. It is up to the individual teachers to
carry this out; no one checks whether and how they do so.
Article 8 (1) (h)
The University of Leipzig remains the only place where teachers are trained to teach
Sorbian/Wendish. The state of Brandenburg funds a half-time post there for a lecturer for
special tasks, which is clearly insufficient for training language instructors at all grade
levels and all types of schools. It is impossible to foresee the impact on Lower Sorbian
teacher training of current considerations to reorganize the institute of Sorbian studies
and possibly turn it into an institute for minority languages. Further, teacher training in
Saxony and Brandenburg continues to diverge, so that training in line with Saxony's
system (different degrees, types of schools and grade levels) may become less and less
attractive for potential students from Brandenburg.
In addition to the advanced teacher training programme mentioned in the report, there is
also the master programme in Lower Sorbian at the University of Leipzig, which was
mentioned in the fourth periodical report. Five students completed the programme during
the reporting period. It is not clear whether this programme will be continued, although it
has been approved in principle.
There are no structured advanced training measures, despite the undertakings in Article
8 (1) (g). There are isolated classes, such as those offered by the State Education Office
in Frankfurt (Oder) for teachers of ethics and religion.
At the University of Potsdam's teacher training centre, four pedagogical guides on
Sorbian/Wendish topics and one on the Sinti and Roma have been produced and are
available for free on the Internet.
Article 8 (1) (i)
The language group believes that this undertaking must be regarded as still unfulfilled.
There is no concrete, regular reporting, beyond the Council of Europe monitoring
process. Nor does there appear to be any oversight of measures taken. Neither the
division at the Ministry of Science, Research and Culture nor the desk officer at the
Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport performs this task. In our experience, the state
takes action only in response to pressure from the language group, for example from the
Council for Sorbian/Wendish Affairs, the working party on Sorbian/Wendish educational
issues at the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport or the Sorbian/Wendish education
network.
Article 9
We refer to the state government's statement in October 2012 that using Lower Sorbian
would lengthen court proceedings.
Article 10
We note massive deficits in implementing the use of Lower Sorbian in the administration
and public services.

92
According to the state government's statement in October 2012, using the language in
the administration would constitute an unreasonable burden in technical and
organizational terms. Above all, ignorance and faulty decisions regarding the electronic
data processing systems in use make it almost impossible to use the language correctly.
In this way, persons and organizations with Sorbian/Wendish names are subject to
discrimination. Ultimately, this also affects Article 13 (1) (d) of the Charter. Administration
staff are often unaware of the legal situation, so that individuals using the language have
been asked not to do so in future or have had to inform the administration of the
applicable law.
Article 10 (2) (g) is regularly violated in practice. Bilingual traffic signs are often flawed or
completely absent. A dialogue on traffic signage with the relevant authorities is planned
for 2013. A similar dialogue on rail transport is already under way between
Sorbian/Wendish representatives and Deutsche Bahn AG. The state of Brandenburg
has included provisions to this effect in its draft local transport plan. The local operator of
public transport for Cottbus, Cottbusverkehr, is currently testing bilingual station
announcements in German and Lower Sorbian.
The state's narrow interpretation of the undertaking in Article 10 (4) (c) with regard to
knowledge of the Lower Sorbian language as a positive criterion in filling posts remains
problematic. The language group expressly disagrees with the state's interpretation of
the law.
There is still no legal certainty with regard to fulfilling the undertaking in Article 10 (5) in
view of the use of masculine and feminine forms in Sorbian/Wendish, which differs from
German.
Article 11 (1) (b) (ii) and 1 (c) (ii)
Promoting, encouraging and/or facilitating do not require direct intervention in the
guaranteed freedom of the press. As this undertaking is also applicable law (Section 12
(1) of the Act on the Specification of the Rights of the Sorbs, the state's opposition is
incomprehensible.

IV.

Comments by the Low German language group

1. General remarks
The Low German language group expressly welcomes the efforts to make the fifth
periodical report shorter and more structured than the previous reports. The Federal
Council for Low German (Bundesraat för Nedderdüütsch, BfN) supports the measures
taken by the Federal Ministry of the Interior to this end. With regard to the content, the
Federal Council welcomes the persistence of the Committee of Ministers in its effort to
protect and promote the regional language Low German.
The Federal Council sees major differences in the eight federal states which have placed
Low German under the protection of the Language Charter. As in the past, there are a
few exemplary measures and a large number of rather slow processes. All groups
involved in the process of implementing the Language Charter are urged to base their
actions and reporting practice on the legal commentary on the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages published in 2011 (in German) with the support of the
Federal Ministry of the Interior and the Council of Europe.

93
Surprisingly, the periodical report makes no mention of the fact that the key Low German
structures in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania were abolished in 2012. After five months
of struggle, it was possible to keep Schleswig-Holstein from terminating the funding
agreement for the Institut für Niederdeutsche Sprache (INS) in 2010, which would have
threatened the existence of activities related to the regional language. In view of that
experience, the brief mention of reduced subsidies starting in 2012 (E. I. 1. b.) is highly
unsatisfactory. Bremen, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein cut the
institute's budget by about 8%, consciously accepting cutbacks in interregional efforts on
behalf of Low German.
In the eight federal states which have placed Low German under the protection of the
Language Charter, representatives of the language group see major differences
regarding inclusion in policy and government-administrative contexts. The Federal
Council welcomes the 2012 decision of Bremen's parliament to establish a consultative
council for Low German. By contrast, it is highly irritated by North Rhine-Westphalia's
attempt to shirk the undertaking in Article 7 (4) when it states that the current players, i.e.
the Fachstelle and the Commission, ensure the cultivation of Low German to a suitable
extent (letter of 21 September 2011). Brandenburg too showed little ambition when in its
response of 1 March 2012 to a minor interpellation the state government said: "The state
does not meet the conditions for committing to comply with 35 of the undertakings in Part
III of the Charter with regard to Low German. As a result, Low German in Brandenburg
does not come under the protection according to Part III of the Charter, but rather Part II.
Part II formulates general aims, and states may place one or more languages merely
under the 'protection' of this Part (which is less binding than Part III)." This response
misunderstands Part II as a purely symbolic framework, as no protection is undertaken
and the state also actively rejects all action or incentives for other stakeholders to act.
The Federal Council supports the ideas for a division of responsibilities between the
federal and state governments. The principle of federalism, in this case involving eight
federal states, often proves to be an obstacle in efforts concerning Low German. With
this in mind, the representation of Low German speakers welcomes the federal and state
efforts to use the annual meeting of federal and state officials to share information and
coordinate on substantive issues. This positive approach could be expanded by inviting
expert representatives to the relevant discussions. For example, it was not possible to
meet with education desk officers during the reporting period. It is all the more
regrettable that the states have not commented on the Federal Council's position papers
on implementing the Charter in education. The language group representatives are not
sure whether the state governments forwarded these position papers to their education
ministries or how they may have been received. The states' representation at these
meetings could also be improved; the same can be said of the representatives of the
Bundestag parliamentary groups in the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning
the Low German Language Group.
The Federal Council notes that many of the events and measures mentioned in the
periodical report are organized by the private sector or by volunteers, in many cases
without any state support or even without the state's knowledge.
2. Comments on the individual Council of Europe recommendations
Recommendation 1: In formal legal terms, the principle formulated here may be
sufficient. However, in practice and thus in the concrete application of the Language

94
Charter, major deficits are apparent, for example in a recent incident at the Stormarn job
centre, where an individual was told that the Charter did not apply because of the small
number of language speakers. This statement contradicts both federal law and the state
law of Schleswig-Holstein, raising the question: How do the states make sure that their
executive agencies are properly informed about the Language Charter and its
application in practice?
Recommendation 5: The Federal Council for Low German thanks the Committee of
Ministers for focusing on Low German as a school subject. The states have followed this
recommendation in very different ways. Here too it is regrettable that the states have not
worked with each other on the necessary curriculum developments. The comments
incorporated in the report represent important starting points for all further discussion in
this area.
Of the eight states addressed, six have rejected the idea without even seriously
considering it. Brandenburg, Bremen, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony,
North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein do not plan to introduce Low German
as a subject of instruction, thereby rejecting an important and effective way to promote
the language. Brandenburg argues that the number of interested pupils is too low.
Firstly, there are no reliable data to confirm this, and secondly, the focus for the
necessary government action is on supply, while the documented demand is secondary.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania continues to regard Low German instruction as part of
German instruction, even though this model has not proved effective especially with
regard to language acquisition. North Rhine-Westphalia uses the argument that the
number of Low German speakers is continually shrinking; instead of concluding that the
task is therefore all the more urgent, however, it uses this argument to justify its lack of
activity.
Bremen's example shows that it certainly would have been possible to make qualitative
progress during the reporting period: In its report An Plattdüütsch fasthollen un
Plattdüütsch starker machen, Bremen's state parliament made the following
announcement: "In this context the Senate intends to monitor the introduction of Low
German as a separate subject of instruction in the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg
in order to determine whether its experience is useful for anchoring Low German in the
curriculum, approved subject hours and teacher training. Teaching materials are to be
drafted in consultation with the INS and other states. Low German as an option for
language acquisition with the aim of multilingualism should be more clearly defined"
(parliament of the city-state of Bremen, printed document 17/1761; 17th term 3 May
2011). So far, no action has followed this announcement. The Bremen state parliament's
policy paper on multilingualism in Bremen (parliament of the city-state of Bremen, printed
document 17/1717; 17th term 29 March 2011) does not contain a single reference to the
importance of Low German in school or preschool education.
Only Saxony-Anhalt and Hamburg have expressed the desire to fulfil the undertakings
agreed to when they signed the Language Charter. The Federal Council expressly
welcomes this position. It is noticeable that Hamburg's good example does not refer to
the law. This raises the question as to how reliable the required optional subject of Low
German is at Hamburg's primary schools.
Recommendation 6: There is no question that an effective monitoring mechanism is
needed in the field of education beyond the existing structures. This is confirmed by the
response to Recommendation 5. The regular report for the Council of Europe does not

95
really fulfil the monitoring/oversight function, as the state ministries avoid self-criticism
and any mention of shortcomings or areas in need of improvement. They demonstrate
the same reaction even within the states when reporting to the state parliaments. Only
the bodies assigned to the state parliaments in which the Low German institutions have
a vote promise effective monitoring and realistic accountability.
It would be desirable for all relevant states to follow the same or at least comparable
praxis of reporting to the state parliaments.
Recommendation 7: To our knowledge, the interpretation of Section 184 of the
Judicature Act as presented here is not accepted anywhere in judicial practice or
teaching. This discrepancy demonstrates the need for the German authorities to take
more resolute action to establish a structured policy.
The reference to local practice of conducting weddings or registering same-sex civil
unions in Low German is incorrect. Marriages and civil unions are formalized by signing
a form in High German; only the spoken part of the ceremony may be in Low German.
Recommendation 8: The Federal Council regrets that the debate over government
discretion with regard to media providers has reached an impasse. In May 2010, the
Federal Council organized a media convention in Hamburg; one of its aims was to
advance the dialogue with policy-makers, public administration and public broadcasters
(see the documentation Zwischen Kulturauftrag und Unterhaltungsprogramm (Between
cultural commitment and entertainment), Leer 2010) and to take a fresh look at existing
options. Their statements in the current periodical report show that the states have
retreated even further behind concepts such as freedom of the press and broadcasters
and media neutrality.
There is no question that the media, especially television and radio, have a great
influence on the public perception of Low German. So the Federal Council is still waiting
for more leadership from the government bodies. In current practice, the federal and
state governments' interpretation of the law largely questions the Charter process when
it comes to the media.
The Federal Council acknowledges Bremen's efforts to establish Low German more
firmly within the framework of its state law on the media (Landesmediengesetz). By
contrast, the remarks by North Rhine-Westphalia are hardly compatible with the Charter.
The efforts described to provide public access to 1960s-era audio recordings from the
WDR archives are admirable, but they hardly qualify as evidence of active, up-to-date
language policy. The same is true of the Low German articles in the Westfälische
Nachrichten and the website of Münster's Stadtheimatbund.
3. Part II of the Language Charter
3.1. Education, especially university education
The Part II states show only limited willingness to address the issue of Low German in
education proactively and constructively. As a result, the reports by Brandenburg, North
Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony-Anhalt show little progress or hope for the future. The
states urgently need to realize that by signing Part II of the Language Charter, they have
accepted undertakings which must be fulfilled using concrete measures.
Brandenburg's report gives the impression that the state is not willing to make any room
for Low German within the official educational system. North Rhine-Westphalia refers to

96
a few isolated activities in the Münsterland region and to private activities which the state
neither funds nor supports. The lengthy reporting on university research once again
demonstrates the medieval focus, which hardly helps promote the regional language.
The Federal Council sees some promising trends in Saxony-Anhalt: Extracurricular
activities and the revision and distribution of the primer show that the state is making an
effort.
During the reporting period, Lower Saxony took a series of promising measures in order
to establish the regional language more firmly in the education system. The decree Die
Region und ihre Sprachen im Unterricht (the region and its languages in the classroom)
creates the possibility of language acquisition, the title Plattdeutsche Schule (Low
German school) creates incentives, and fixed numbers of hours for advising and support
have been allotted for the first time. It should also be emphasized that these measures
have all been taken in close consultation with representatives of the Low German
language group. The report documents the efforts to improve the status of Low German
in the education system. Because Lower Saxony did not sign any of the relevant items
under Article 8, the Federal Council calls on the state to sign on to the undertakings
related to primary and secondary school under Article 8 after the fact.
3.2. Specific measures at preschools, schools and in advanced training
Brandenburg once again defends its lack of activity by citing a lack of demand; our
information does not confirm such a lack, and this approach fundamentally contradicts
that of the Language Charter. North Rhine-Westphalia's reference to a planned school
pilot project is not aimed at a regular elective and as such is out of place. The Federal
Council acknowledges the efforts of Saxony-Anhalt.
4. Part III of the Language Charter
4.1. Education
The reports by the individual states reveal very different levels of engagement; the
positive trends, such as those in Hamburg, deserve to serve their neighbouring states as
encouragement and a spur to further action. Regrettably, however, the states
automatically react defensively, which is hardly conducive to improvement.
By formulating a rejection without supplying any arguments, Schleswig-Holstein ignores
the Committee of Experts' recommendation and shows surprisingly little willingness to
cooperate with the Charter process. Given the current efforts to establish Low German
model schools in various regions, a more proactive attitude could have been expected
from the state. We would like to point out that the update of the schools decree
announced in the fourth periodical report has not yet been carried out.
Bremen's curricula for primary and secondary schools shows no evidence whatsoever of
"anchoring" Low German. The curricula still contain unsystematic demands to use the
regional language in the classroom. The Charter does not require schools to design Low
German offerings without a command in the curricula. There is no empirical evidence at
all that Low German is taught in primary schools. Even if one assumes that Low German
is occasionally featured in classroom instruction, this would not meet the Charter
requirement that Low German should be systematically offered as a school subject. The
numbers of participants in the reading competition are falling, especially at the
secondary level. Bremen does not advertise the competition in an up-to-date way, nor

97
does it support the competition with classroom offerings or standards. The responsible
minister is a patron in name only.
The Federal Council sees the most progress during the reporting period in Hamburg's
primary school praxis. Curriculum requirements are aimed at language acquisition
drawing on regional culture; they meet current standards and could serve as models for
other states. However, the Federal Council insists that Low German offerings be
continued at secondary level. Necessary legislation must be enacted in the foreseeable
future and a framework plan must be put in place.
When Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania reports that Low German is integrated in
German classes and is nonetheless continuously taught, one must question the quality
and quantity of such instruction, in particular the effectiveness of language acquisition.
The Federal Council finds no reference to the fact that the Low German commissioner
stepped down in 2012.
With regard to advanced teacher training, positive trends are apparent in SchleswigHolstein and Hamburg. The Federal Council expressly welcomes the creation of the Low
German forum in Hamburg, which acts as a network and source of new ideas. The
appointment of a state specialist adviser in Schleswig-Holstein has proved effective.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania does not give any reasons for discontinuing the highly
praised certificate course in Low German.
Bremen's statement that demand for Low German in teacher training is not growing calls
for action. Until students and teacher trainees see some evidence that Low German is a
regular school subject, until even individual schools establish the regional language as
part of their programme or profile, one cannot seriously expect students or trainees to
feel motivated to take advantage of the relevant offerings.
The Federal Council notes with regret that no progress of any kind has been made with
regard to vocational schools. This is surprising, given the fact that numerous institutions
have recognized the need to take regional language skills into account. The Federal
Council calls on Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to study whether Low
German modules should be added to training for health-care occupations.
4.2. Administrative authorities and public services
Public administration has made little progress with regard to Low German, even though
there are many ways government could serve as a model in dealing with the regional
language. The Federal Council greatly regrets that the government has once again failed
to take advantage of these opportunities.
It remains to note that Low German is not recognized as a legally binding language for
documents or contracts, neither by tax offices nor for marriages, nor can one register a
child using Low German (example of Mika Fuhler, born 11.11.2012). There are no legally
binding publications in Low German. Objections in the land consolidation procedure may
not be lodged in Low German (examples: land consolidation procedure for the
Bersenbrück Bypass, Altenoythe Hohefeld land consolidation procedure).
While Lower Saxony maintains that the state cannot set any requirements for local
governments regarding the use of Low German due to the right of local autonomy, this
argument is obviously faulty, as language requirements – namely, the use of German –
are set in practice. Because local governments' right of autonomy is governed by law,

98
the obligations arising from the Language Charter should also be included. The state is
called on to require the use of Low German.
We reject Bremen's argument that no action is required to fulfil the undertakings
accepted because they are simply a prohibition of a prohibition. Implementing the
Language Charter demands action. The same applies to Schleswig-Holstein's position
that merely allowing documents to be written in Low German satisfies the Language
Charter.
When Hamburg states that it sees no need for action, we can only respond: The state is
obligated to take action. When it comes to hiring officially certified interpreters, the state
should have no trouble finding them with the help of the Low German department at the
university or the Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache. Hamburg mentions the possibility
for public service staff to be assigned to an area where Low German is used. It is not
clear what form this rule takes nor how it has been publicized within the public service.
4.3. Media
To begin with, the general statements under Recommendation 8 apply.
Some of the text was obviously copied directly from elements supplied by the radio
stations for the periodical report. As a result, numerous explanations lack the appropriate
neutrality (calling for critical distance would doubtless be presumptuous). In general, we
would like to point out that individual and thus random television or radio productions are
not suitable evidence of a structured media policy. This applies to public as well as
commercial broadcasters.
"Preferential treatment for Low German" is explicitly rejected with regard to promoting
audiovisual works. The Federal Council does not expect any "preferential treatment";
however, like the Committee of Experts, it asks about measures to encourage and
facilitate, or equivalent promotion. Unfortunately, there are no such measures.
The Federal Council welcomes the activities of the Plattolio association but asks about
the proportion of funding from Hamburg. It also refers to the fact that Plattolio is the
result of a private initiative which is largely funded by donations, some of them from the
Plattdüütschroot för Hamborg; sub-projects in 2010, 2011 and 2012 also received
targeted funding from the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media.
The consideration of Low German elements in training for journalists is apparently
evaluated differently in Bremen and Hamburg. While Bremen stresses the nongovernmental nature of this field (and thus questions its obligations under the Charter),
Hamburg describes means and structures that seem to have little practical relevance.
The Federal Council calls on these states to agree on a common position and then come
up with a sustainable catalogue of measures.
4.4. Cultural activities and facilities
In 2012, the Federal Council summarized its positions in this field in nine "cultural
theses". It regrets to note that the states give no references for their activities.
From the perspective of targeted federal or state funding, this area is especially difficult
due to the significant private contributions to cultural activities. The Federal Council
repeats its demand that the reports should only contain those measures that come about
due to targeted government funding. For example, the Ohnsorg-Theater in Hamburg and
the Amateurtheaterverband receive government funding in the form of Hamburg's usual

99
cultural funding. This is a welcome case of equivalent and language-independent
funding. However, the point is that this funding is precisely not for regional linguistic
culture.
The individual findings of the states clearly demonstrate that there is no targeted or
coordinated promotion of Low German culture. When Bremen counts news reports
translated from High German as "works in Low German", it blocks the view of Low
German literature, which does indeed exist. The Federal Council is surprised to find that
the decision to establish a consultative council for Low German, which is certainly
desirable, is mentioned only under Article 12 (Culture) and not with reference to the
Charter undertakings in education nor to the issue of monitoring (Recommendation 6). If
this council is to be a body as referred to in Article 7 (4) of the Language Charter, then
the Bremen council must be able to influence the implementation of the Language
Charter in all relevant areas.
4.5. Economic and social life
The role of Low German as a language in social care facilities changed in 2012 in
particular, as this issue has received media attention and been the subject of public
discussion. Here, the focus should not be only on persons with dementia, but on
providing humane care for persons in at-risk situations. Hamburg and SchleswigHolstein at least recognize this; these states along with Bremen and MecklenburgWestern Pomerania are urgently called on to support the activities in their states.
5. Outlook
The Federal Council continues to see significant possibilities for proactively
implementing the Language Charter. It urgently calls on the states to agree on a
coordinated plan of action. The framework conditions for effective language policy are
good, even though some adjustment is needed in certain areas. For example, Lower
Saxony should examine whether undertakings in the school core area could be accepted
after the fact. In view of the threat to the existence of Low German in the southern
language region, the Part II states (Brandenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and SaxonyAnhalt) are called on to intensify their language protection measures by signing Part III
after the fact.

V. Comments by the Frisian Council (Friesenrat, Sektion Nord)
Working basis of the Frisian ethnic group:
As mentioned in the Reports submitted under the Council of Europe’s Framework
Convention for the Protection of National Minorities from 2005 to 2010 and in 2011-2012
under the heading FORUM F3, the 2006 guidelines published in the second edition of
the brochure Modell Nordfriesland (the model of North Frisia) continue to be the
principles of the Frisian ethnic group
(http://www.friesenrat.de/inside/pdf/2006_modell_NF.pdf).
In this brochure, the Frisian Council lists the key areas which the Frisian ethnic group
considers essential for preserving and promoting the Frisian language. The model
addresses various topics, including




associations,
education,
research / teacher training,

100




public policies / administration,
literature / music / theatre / film, and
media,

describing the general situation, challenges and possible solutions as perceived by the
Frisian Council, and continues to be the most important conceptual groundwork of the
Frisian ethnic group.
On the positive side, the Frisians’ long-cherished wish for a joint centre came true in late
summer 2010 thanks to special federal funding. Since October 2010 the Frasche
Rädj/Friesenrat Sektion Nord e.V. (Frisian Council), the Nordfriesischer Verein e.V
(North Frisian Association) and the Friisk Foriining (Frisian Association) have their
offices in the Friisk Hüs at Süderstraße 6 in Bräist/Bredstedt.
The Frisian Council holds the view that public service media should ensure that a
minority language such as Frisian is given sufficient coverage in public service
broadcasting, regardless of audience ratings. The legal and material feasibility of such
changes is evidenced by the situation of the Sorbs in Brandenburg and Saxony who
have a several-hours’ daily radio programme and regular though short TV programmes
in the Sorbian language (both MDR and RBB).
In this respect, the Consultative Committee on Issues concerning the Frisian Ethnic
Group recommended during its meeting in December 2012 that the Frisian ethnic group
should apply for a seat in the NDR State Broadcasting Board. Even though the
government cannot issue instructions to the NDR and media representatives, having a
Frisian representative in the Board could be helpful. The Sorbian ethnic group may be
considered a best-practice example in this context.
In September 2010, the FRIISFUNK broadcasting station was officially inaugurated in
Alkersum on the island of Föhr. Although Friisfunk, funded in cooperation with the
Offener Kanal (OK) Schleswig-Holstein and with federal funds, does not yet meet all
requirements, it is a step in the right direction.
We were also pleased that in summer 2010, the Nordfriesland district gave the Frisian
ethnic group the opportunity to comment on the first draft of a report on the protection of
minorities and propose amendments. We consider political participation of the Frisian
ethnic group at all levels a prerequisite for our daily lives.
While there has been some progress in certain areas, in particular the Friisk Hüs,
unfortunately some problems remain to be solved.
Unsolved problems / Outlook
In particular the Nordfriisk Instituut is still struggling with the same basic problems as
before: While the number of tasks is growing, the number of available posts has
decreased. Germany refers to the work of the Nordfriisk Instituut when describing the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. However,
the institute cannot fulfil the undertakings entered into for the Frisian ethnic group with
the limited resources available.
Based on the recommendations of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts, we are
listing the following problems the solution of which is essential for preserving the Frisian
language and culture:


teaching Frisian as an integral part of the curriculum,

101





ensuring coverage in public service broadcasting,
creating financial frameworks to ensure nursery school education,
changing project funding into institutional funding,
ensuring long-term funding of the Nordfriisk Instituut.

In this context, we would like to reiterate that the Council of Europe’s Committee of
Experts adopted the following conclusions regarding the German authorities’ response
to the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of 25 May 2011:
“Chapter 2.
Conclusions of the Committee of Experts on how the German authorities reacted to the
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers
Recommendation 1:
“adopt specific legal provisions, where their absence hinders practical implementation of
the undertakings which Germany has entered into under the Charter”
12. No legal provisions to implement the Charter have been adopted. The German
authorities maintain that the Charter is directly applicable and that emphasis should be
put on practical application of the undertakings.
Recommendation 2:
“adopt and implement a structured policy for the promotion and preservation of North
Frisian, Sater Frisian and Lower Sorbian, including in particular measures which ensure
as a matter of urgency that primary and secondary education is available in these
languages”
13. Schleswig-Holstein issued a decree concerning North Frisian language education,
which requires schools to inform parents that they may request that their children take
part in North Frisian language education and offers the possibility to include Frisian as
an optional subject in the regular curriculum from the seventh grade onwards. In
practice, North Frisian education still meets with difficulties, due to the fact that teaching
generally takes place outside regular hours, due to a lack of teachers and since there
are no binding curricula. In addition there is a lack of continuity between school levels
and programmes.
.....
266. The Committee of Experts recalls that the undertaking requires the German
authorities at least to make available North Frisian teaching as an integral part of the
curriculum. As this minimum condition does not seem to be met, the Committee of
Experts maintains its previous conclusion that the undertaking is not fulfilled.
270. The Committee of Experts notes that in practice a total of 902 pupils in 20 schools
of all levels studied North Frisian in the 2009/2010 school year and that compared to the
information in the previous monitoring cycles their number has significantly decreased.
Although the decree seems to slightly improve the position of North Frisian in secondary
education, further measures including the systematic and continued provision of North
Frisian as an integral part of the curriculum at all levels of secondary education are
necessary.
Recommendation 6:

102
“take measures so that adequate radio and television broadcasting are available in Sater
Frisian, North Frisian, Lower Sorbian and Danish.”
22. As regards the more general issue of providing financial incentives to private
broadcasters with a view to obtaining programmes in minority languages, the German
authorities continue to consider such intervention as incompatible with the independence
of the media.
23. Regarding North Frisian, the Hamburg/Schleswig Holstein media authority (MAHSH)
organized a call for bids especially aimed at providers that could contribute to the
promotion of Frisian. A frequency on the Island of Föhr was awarded to the Open
Channel Schleswig-Holstein for ten years. The Open Channel will broadcast one hour
per day in North Frisian. (cf. Strasbourg, 25 May 2011 ECRML (2011) 2, EUROPEAN
CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES: APPLICATION OF THE
CHARTER IN GERMANY, Fourth monitoring cycle, pp. 6)
Since 2012 the Frisian Council has chaired the Inter-Frisian Council (Interfriesischer
Rat). During its three-year term, the Council will focus on Frisian in Schleswig-Holstein. It
plans to organize a series of events in Schleswig-Holstein, culminating in a final
conference in 2015. The Frisian Council hopes that Schleswig-Holstein will create the
legal and financial framework for using the Frisian Council’s term also for self-promotion.

VI. Comments by the Danish minority
On behalf of the Danish minority, the South Schleswig Voters’ Association (SSW) and
the Danish Schools Association for South Schleswig (Dansk Skoleforening for
Sydslesvig) would like to thank the authorities for submitting the Fifth Report of the
Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with Article 15 (1) of the European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages.
First of all, we would like to note that minority policy in Schleswig-Holstein has improved
since the change of government in June 2012. The coalition of SPD, Bündnis 90/Die
Grünen and SSW has remedied the discriminating minority policy of the previous CDUFDP government and emphasized that an active minority policy is an important
cornerstone of the government’s agenda. For the time being, this means that German
Sinti and Roma enjoy the same rights of protection and promotion as the Danish minority
and the Frisian minority since 1990. In addition, from 1 January 2013 the same cost-perpupil rates will once again apply to Danish schools. The discriminating reduction to 85 %
was revoked.
Moreover, in the 2013 budget the reduction of cultural funding adopted in 2010 will also
be revoked. The Danish minority is delighted about these amendments and would like to
enhance Schleswig-Holstein’s pioneering role in minority policy together with the state
government.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank the Federal Government and the
Bundestag for the funding provided in 2011 and 2012 to compensate for cuts in funding
of Schleswig-Holstein for the schools of the Danish minority.

103
We would like to comment on the report as follows:
Schools
The Danish Schools Association for South Schleswig expressly welcomes the reestablishment of full equality of its pupils on the basis of the 2007 Schools Act,
announced for 1 January 2013, and the announced examination of an equal funding of
the transport of pupils. However, we are observing with great interest the new
approaches to calculate cost-per-pupil rates. For example, both the calculation of
material costs of all private schools and the rates for pupils of the Danish Schools
Association from the Danish minority in South Schleswig have been changed. Though
understandable, the reasons for these changes are not transparent as regards the
calculation and results so that further developments need to be awaited. No significant
progress has been made also in adopting legislation that creates equality in the area of
the transport of pupils. The Minister-President’s Commissioner for Minorities and the
Danish Schools Association participate in a working group of the Ministry for Education
Science discussing a new approach to funding private schools.
Concerning the statements of Schleswig-Holstein, Dansk Skoleforening for Sydslesvig
e.V. would like to note that


the cost-per-pupil rates are linked to the cost trends of public schools and thus
reflect the costs of public schools;



Danish schools are reimbursed for increased costs of public schools only with a
delay of two years;



funding of Danish schools was about 4.5% below the amount specified in the
2007 Schools Act despite the federal compensation payments in 2011 and 2012;



due to the state’s policy, a large city school, the Christian Paulsen-Skolen, in
Flensburg had to be closed (2011) and further drastic budget cuts were imposed.

Savings as achieved by closing the Christian Paulsen-Skolen and other drastic
measures could have been achieved only by closing several small schools in rural areas.
This would have seriously endangered the minority in some regions. Without the federal
compensation payments, the very existence of Danish language education in SchleswigHolstein would have been at stake.
Language and the media
b. Article 10 (1) (a) (v)
Many obstacles still have to be overcome when it comes to the right to submit
documents in Danish to administrative authorities. In practice, Danish citizens and
Danish organizations continue to be asked to translate protocols and business reports
into German. At the moment, financial authorities, for example, do not implement the
Charter in practice. For example, Dansk Sundhedstjeneste (Danish health service) has
experienced that public authorities in the districts and municipalities of SchleswigHolstein, health insurance funds and medical services do not give appropriate priority to
the Language Charter in practice. Unfortunately, we repeatedly observe that staff has no
Danish language skills and is not aware of the Language Charter.

104
G. Concluding remarks
The responsible federal and state authorities will scrutinize the language groups’ critical
comments and report on further progress in the next State Report.
