by Hungary
(Adopted by the Committee of Ministers
on 4 October 2001
at the 766th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies)

The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages;
Bearing in mind the instrument of ratification submitted by the Republic of Hungary
on 26 April 1995;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts of the Charter
with respect to the application of the Charter by the Republic of Hungary;
Bearing in mind that this evaluation is based on information submitted by Hungary in
its initial periodical report, supplementary information provided by the Hungarian
Government, information submitted by bodies and associations legally established in
Hungary, and information obtained by the Committee of Experts during its “on the
spot visit”,
Recommends that the Republic of Hungary:
1.
establish a policy for developing the Romani and Beas languages, with the
aim of facilitating their use in public life, and respond to the needs of the users of
these languages, in particular in education;
2.
strengthen the institutional infrastructure for teaching in and of the minority
languages, and develop further the possibilities of bilingual education and provide
sufficient teacher training;
3.
strengthen the possibilities of speakers of minority languages to use their
language before the courts and in relations with the administration, by taking
organisational and other appropriate measures to ensure that the existing legal
mechanisms can be utilised in practice;
4.
continue to develop the potential of its newly established system of minority
self-governments in view of the valuable contribution it can make to the promotion of
the minority languages.
