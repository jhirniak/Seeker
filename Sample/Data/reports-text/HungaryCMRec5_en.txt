(Adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 10 July 2013
at the 1176th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies)

The Committee of Ministers,
In accordance with Article 16 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages;
Having regard to the instrument of ratification submitted made by Hungary on 26 April 1995;
Having taken note of the evaluation made by the Committee of Experts on the Charter with respect to the
application of the Charter by Hungary;
Bearing in mind that this evaluation is based on information submitted by Hungary in its fifth periodical report,
supplementary information given by the Hungarian authorities, information submitted by bodies and
associations legally established in Hungary and information obtained by the Committee of Experts during its
on-the-spot visit;
Having taken note of the comments made by the Hungarian authorities on the contents of the Committee of
Experts' report,
Recommends that the authorities of Hungary take account of all the observations and recommendations of
the Committee of Experts and, as a matter of priority:
1.
develop a structured long-term policy and plan for education in all regional or minority languages and
set up a dedicated monitoring mechanism, as envisaged by Article 8, 1(i) of the Charter;
2.
further increase bilingual education at all stages with a view to moving from the model of only
teaching the language as a subject to bilingual education in Part III languages, and increase accordingly the
number of teachers able to teach subjects in these languages;
3.

take resolute measures in order to increase the number of teachers for Romani and Beás;

4.
take steps to ensure that the relevant administrative authorities implement the obligations under
Article 10 of the Charter, in particular by specifying those administrative districts where organisational
measures should be taken, and informing speakers of regional or minority languages of their rights under
Article 10;
5.
further improve the offer of minority language programmes on television and develop and finance a
comprehensive scheme for the training of journalists and other media staff using minority languages.
