Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Executive Summary
1. This typology study is a successful outcome of a cooperative effort of MONEYVAL2, the
Council of Europe’s Global Project on Cybercrime3 as well as the joint project of the European
Union and the Council of Europe against money laundering and the financing of terrorism in
the Russian Federation (MOLI-RU 2). This report originates from a practitioners’ desire to
analyse the links between cybercrime and money laundering, the most frequently used
methods and instruments for laundering criminal proceeds from cybercrime and through the
Internet, as well as the risks and vulnerabilities posed by this type of money laundering.
2. This report differs slightly from other typologies reports previously elaborated by MONEYVAL,
given that it was prepared using a wide-ranging source of data, gathered through a survey to
which MONEYVAL, FATF and EAG member countries governmental experts as well as private
sector institutions specialised in cybercrime matters. Hence, for the first time, it pooled
resources and expertise from financial intelligence units, financial investigation services and
high tech crime units and consulted key stakeholders from the private sector who
contributed their experience to the project.
3. The report notes that though cybercrime appears to be widespread and generates large
amounts of criminal proceeds, the data on related money laundering and evidence of
successful law enforcement action is weak. In addition to contributing to raising awareness
on current initiatives aimed at preventing and combating cybercrime and money laundering,
as well as on proceeds generating offences on the Internet, the report considers the cyberlaundering risks and vulnerabilities and illustrates identified money laundering methods,
techniques, mechanisms and instruments of criminal proceeds from cybercrime relying on a
number of cases received from contributors, setting out typologies that were identified and
specific indicators of potential money laundering activity within this context.
4. Unlike traditional money laundering schemes involving the use of the banking system, cyberlaundering involves sophisticated schemes and relies on various types of operations and
financial services providers, ranging from bank transfers, cash withdrawals/deposits, the
using of digital/ electronic currencies to money mules and money remittance providers. At
the same time, the awareness of risks related to new payment systems and services and of
related money laundering appears to be at a relatively low level. Hence, the detection and
pursuit of the criminal money flows is much more challenging for law enforcement agencies.
Furthermore, there is a clear risk of undetected or low report rate of cybercrime offences in
most countries, which impacts on the absence of related financial investigations and money
laundering investigations.
5. In its conclusion, the report sets out a number of findings as regards cybercrime and money
laundering and of available countermeasures and good practices in some countries, which
could inspire policy makers and regulators or become elements of more systematic future
approaches and strategies that are aimed at the prevention of money laundering and the
financing of terrorism, and at the search, seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime on
the Internet. A number of areas have been identified which are considered as having the
potential to enhance global action and contribute to overall efforts to prevent and combat
money laundering in this context.

INTRODUCTION

1.1

Objective of the study

1.
Information and communication technologies (ICT) and in particular the Internet linking up
computers worldwide offer unique opportunities to societies worldwide. The Internet allows an
increasing number of people1 and organisations to communicate, exchange information, to offer and
make use of services, and to exercise their rights. At the same time, the reliance on ICT and the
Internet makes societies vulnerable to threats such as cybercrime.
2.

For the purposes of this study, cybercrime denotes:2

–

offences against computer data and systems: this includes in particular the so-called “c.i.a.offences” against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems;
offences committed by means of computer data and systems: this includes offences such as
fraud and child pornography or offences related to intellectual property rights that gain a
different quality and impact if committed through computer systems.

–

3.
The fact that any economic or serious crime may involve computer systems makes
cybercrime a very broad and cross-cutting concept. In addition, cybercrime is highly transnational in
nature. It is increasingly targeted at generating economic proceeds involving different types of fraud
and economic and organised crime. While some are new types of crime, many are traditional types of
crime that are now committed more effectively on the Internet. In addition, a digital underground
economy is in place and growing, which involves organised crime, available IT experts, hackers, mules
and other persons for hire, and is designed to provide the necessary tool and services to facilitate the
commission of cybercrime or to ensure the disposal of crime proceeds. Organised crime groups do not
necessarily need to develop their own expertise about the Internet, as such skills or services can be
recruited to respond on a needs basis, creating a sort of transactional basis network connection
between “small- time criminals” and organised crime, even located in different parts of the world. This
suggests large amounts of criminal money flows on the Internet.
4.
When money laundering is criminalised based on an all crimes approach, all proceedsgenerating types of cybercrime would be considered as predicate offences for money laundering and
the property that has been laundered taken out of or put into the “system” at any point considered as
money laundering. Cybercrime is thus highly relevant for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist
financing efforts.
5.
A wide range of stakeholders is involved in measures against such forms of crime not only
from the public sector but in particular from the private sector. Although there are examples of multistakeholder action, efforts remain rather fragmented. Initiatives against fraud on the Internet are not
necessarily linked to activities carried out by financial intelligence units or law enforcement authorities
responsible for financial investigations.

1

For Internet use statistics, see http://www.Internetworldstats.com/stats.htm. It is estimated that by March 2011,

over 2 billion people used the Internet (representing a penetration rate of 30.2 % of the global population and a
growth of 480.4% between 2000 and 2011).
2

This “definition” is based on the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (www.coe.int/cybercrime).

6.
In short, on the one hand, much progress has been made since the late 1980s with regard to
the creation of systems for the prevention and control of money laundering and more recently the
financing of terrorism, and since the mid-1990s, in establishing financial investigations aimed at
confiscating proceeds from crime as part of criminal investigations. Progress has also been made since
2001 in enacting cybercrime legislation, establishing high-tech crime units, improving capacities for the
investigation, prosecution and adjudication of cybercrime as well as international co-operation, and
more recently also in strengthening public-private co-operation. On the other hand, the anticybercrime and the financial investigation/anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing
“worlds” remain largely unconnected.
7.
Better knowledge of methods used for laundering the proceeds from crime, including fraud
and terrorist financing, on the Internet through exchange of information between relevant public and
private sector stakeholders can only facilitate more effective financial investigations, the seizure and
confiscation of crime proceeds and the prevention of such crimes through the Internet.
8.

The objectives of this study are as follows:

–
–
–

to examine specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks and methods, trends and
typologies;
to develop indicators to identify criminal money flows and money laundering on the Internet;
to identify possible solutions with regard to preventive measures, multi-stakeholder action,
the seizure and confiscation of criminal money, and the investigation of money laundering
and terrorist financing on the Internet and where possible, document good practices.

1.2

Methodology

9.
This study is the result of a cooperative effort of MONEYVAL3, the Council of Europe’s Global
Project on Cybercrime4 as well as the joint project of the European Union and the Council of Europe
against money laundering and the financing of terrorism in the Russian Federation (MOLI-RU 2),
following the adoption of the project proposal by the MONEYVAL Plenary in September 2009.
10.
The study was prepared by a team comprising representatives of Rosfinmonitoring (Financial
Intelligence Unit of the Russian Federation as co-leader of the study), the Ministry of Interior of the
Russian Federation, the NOCPML (FIU) of Romania, the State Committee for Financial Monitoring (FIU)
of Ukraine, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BAFIN) of Germany, the World Bank, the
MOLI-RU 2 project, the MONEYVAL Secretariat (co-leader) and the Global Project on Cybercrime (coleader). Contributors throughout the project’s lifetime included representatives of McAfee Labs, PayPal,
Team Cymru and UK Payments. Two consultants, Adriana Holtslag-Alvarez (Netherlands) and Dave
O’Reilly (Ireland), facilitated the preparation of the literature review, the questionnaire and the report
outline, and contributed to the substance of the report.
11.
In preparing this report, the team has made use of data and information gathered through a
questionnaire which was circulated January 2010 to MONEYVAL and FATF members as well as law
enforcement and private sector institutions specialised in cybercrime matters. In view of the joint
typology meeting of MONEYVAL and the Eurasian Group (EAG) it was furthermore agreed to associate

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

the Eurasian Group members5 to the study and their responses to the questionnaire were received in
June 2010. The team has thus received 22 responses 6 which enabled to gather valuable information.
12.
The project team members have also held several working meetings during this project. A
first preparatory meeting between ROSFINMONITORING and the Global Project on Cybercrime was
held in Moscow in December 2009. Based on the literature review and the first set of replies received,
a first draft report was discussed by the project team at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in March
2010, which resulted in an agreed draft outline of issues to be covered in the report. An exchange of
views was also held with several representatives of the private sector at that time. In June 2010, the
preparation of the different sections of the report were distributed to members of the project team and
by October 2010, the project team met again to review the draft report.
13.
During the joint MONEYVAL/Eurasian Group meeting of experts on typologies of money
laundering and terrorist financing (Moscow, 9-10 November 2010), a workshop was specifically
dedicated to the themes of: criminal money flows on the Internet (based on the MONEYVAL typology
exercise) and to the risks of misuse of E-money in money laundering and terrorist financing schemes
(based on the EAG typology exercise). The participation of MONEYVAL and EAG members and public
and private sector interventions and discussions fed additional information into the present study and
assisted in validating the interim findings.
14.
In addition, a wide range of publicly available related literature was made use of. The present
study also took into account the findings of the FATF typology studies on money laundering and
terrorist financing related to Internet payment systems of June 20087 and of October 20108. While
these studies focus on new payment methods, the present study provides a broader picture regarding
links, risks and counter-measures related to cybercrime, criminal money flows and money laundering
on the Internet.
15.
Further consultations were held with members of the project team between December 2010
and December 2011 leading to the finalisation of the study.

5

Eurasian Group (EAG) member States are: Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan,

Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.

OVERVIEW OF INITIATIVES AND ISSUES INVOLVED

2.1

Context

2.1.1

Measures against cybercrime

16.
The Convention on Cybercrime was opened for signature in Budapest in November 2001. By
January 2012, it had been ratified by thirty-two states (31 European countries and the USA) and
signed by a further 15 countries (11 European as well as Canada, Japan and South Africa). This treaty,
under Article 37, is open for accession by countries that are not member States of the Council of
Europe and that did not participate in its preparation. So far, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines and Senegal have been invited to accede. In addition, a
large number of countries have been using the Budapest Convention as a guideline for reforming their
legislation. The treaty has served as a basis for guides on cybercrime, training manuals, model laws
and technical assistance. The Budapest Convention thus is the global framework of reference for
cybercrime legislation.
17.

The Budapest Convention requires States:

–

to criminalise attacks against computer data and systems (that is, illegal access, illegal
interception, data interference, system interference and the misuse of devices9) as well as
offences committed by means of a computer system (including computer-related forgery and
fraud10, child pornography11, and infringements of copyright and related rights12);
to put in place procedural law measures to enable its competent authorities to investigate
cybercrime and secure volatile electronic evidence in an efficient manner (including expedited
preservation of data, search and seizure of computer systems, interception of communication
etc.) 13;
to cooperate efficiently with other parties to the Convention through general (such as
extradition, mutual legal assistance and others) and specific provisions (expedited
preservation of data, access to stored computer data, interception of traffic and contents
data, creation of 24/7 points of contact and others) on international co-operation.

–

–

18.
The Convention is complemented by Protocol CETS 189 (of 2003) on xenophobia and racism
committed by means of computer systems.
19.
The Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) has been established under Article 46 in order
to allow the parties to the Convention to consult in view of facilitating the effective implementation of
the Convention, to exchange information and to consider possible amendments or protocols to the
Convention. The T-CY does not have a monitoring or evaluation function, but in November 2011
decided to start assessing implementation of the Budapest Convention by the Parties.

9

See Articles 2-6 of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe (CETS 185).

10
11

Articles 7 and 8 of the Budapest Convention.
Article 9 of the Budapest Convention. The term “child pornography” in the context of cybercrime is often

considered too limiting. The offences provided for in the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children
against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (CETS 201) offer a broader approach.
12

See Article 10 of the Budapest Convention.

13

The procedural powers are not limited to the offences listed in articles 2 to 10. The Budapest Convention, in

article 14 (2), stipulates that the procedural law powers and procedures are to apply to any criminal offences
committed by means of a computer system and the collection of evidence in electronic form of a criminal offence.
9

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

20.
In order to support countries in the implementation of the Budapest Convention, the Council
of Europe, in 2006, launched the Global Project on Cybercrime which assists countries worldwide in the
strengthening of their legislation, the training of law enforcement, prosecutors and judges, publicprivate co-operation, international co-operation as well as measures for the protection of personal data
and the protection of children against sexual exploitation and abuse. The third phase of this project
was launched in January 2012.14 This phase also comprises activities related to criminal money flows
on the Internet. The global project is complemented by country-specific and regional projects.
2.1.2

Measures aimed at money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and at the
search, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime

21.
As regards the international standards, the 2005 Council of Europe Convention on
Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of
Terrorism (“the Warsaw Convention”, CETS 198) updates and revises the 1990 Council of Europe
Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime (“the
Strasbourg Convention”, CETS 141). Both are open Conventions not limited to Council of Europe
member States. CETS 141 has been ratified by all 47 Member States of the Council of Europe and
Australia. Currently the Conventions are operating side by side.
22.
The Warsaw Convention was opened for signature on 16 May 2005 and came into force on 1
May 2008. As at January 2012, 22 States had ratified it and 12 were signatories, including the
European Union. It is anticipated that all 47 Council of Europe Member States would in due course
become Parties to CETS 198, as has been the case with the 1990 Strasbourg Convention, which was
widely ratified. The Convention covers, among other things, confiscation (article 3), investigative and
provisional measures (article 4), freezing, seizure and confiscation (article 5), management of frozen
or seized property (article 6) and investigate powers and techniques (article 7), the criminalisation of
laundering offences (article 9), the establishment of financial intelligence units, financial intelligence
units (FIUs) (article 12), preventive measures (article 13), the postponement of domestic suspicious
transactions, international requests for information on bank accounts (article 17), on banking
transactions (article 18), for monitoring of banking transactions (article 19), for the execution of
provisional measures (articles 21 and 22) and for confiscation (articles 23 and 24) and co-operation
between FIUs (article 46). The Convention provides for a monitoring mechanism, through a Conference
of the Parties to ensure that its provisions are being effectively implemented.
23.
The Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the
Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL) is the independent monitoring body entrusted by the Committee
of Ministers of the Council of Europe with the task of assessing compliance with the principal standards
to counter money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) and the effectiveness of their
implementation. MONEYVAL not only monitors compliance with standards of the CoE but also of the
FATF and the European Union, through a system of mutual peer evaluations. 28 Council of Europe
member States, Israel and the Holy See (including the Vatican City State) are subject to its evaluation
procedures and processes.
24.
The standard setting work (in particular Conventions CETS no. 141 and CETS no. 198) and
monitoring activities by MONEYVAL are complemented by technical co-operation projects which assist
countries in the implementation of agreed upon standards and follow up to MONEYVAL and FATF
14

The Global Project on Cybercrime is funded by public as well as private sector contributions. For Phases 1 and 2,

that is, between September 2006 and December 2011, the governments of Estonia, Japan, Monaco and Romania
and from the private sector McAfee, Visa Europe and in particular Microsoft made voluntary contributions that
complemented financing from the regular budget of the Council of Europe.

Cybercrime: threats, trends, tools and infrastructure

2.2.1

Types of cybercrime

25.

Cybercrime can be divided into the following types of offences:

–

Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems
(the so-called “CIA-offences”), including:
illegal access, for example, through “hacking”, deception or other means;
the illegal interception of computer data;
data interference, including the damaging, deletion, deterioration, alteration or
suppression of computer data;
system interference, including the serious hindering of the functioning of a computer
system, for example, through denial of service attacks against critical infrastructure;
the misuse of devices, which refers, for example, to the production, sale or otherwise
making available of programmes or other devices or tools to commit “CIA-offences”.

–

Offences committed by means of computer systems, including16:
computer-related forgery and fraud;
content-related offences, in particular child pornography and the sexual exploitation
and abuse of children, racism and xenophobia, as well as soliciting, inciting, providing
instructions and offering to commit crimes, ranging from murder, to rape, torture,
sabotage and terrorism. This category also includes cyber-stalking, cyber-bullying, libel
and dissemination of false information through the Internet, and Internet gambling;
offences related to infringement of copyright and related rights, such as the
unauthorised reproduction and use of computer programmes, audio-/video and other
forms of digital works, or of data bases and books.

26.
This classification has proven useful for the development of criminal justice responses17 as
well as for analytical purposes. In reality, however, an offence is likely to consist of a combination of
different types of criminal conduct as illustrated in the following example involving illegal access, illegal
interception, data and system interference, as well as forgery and fraud.
Example: Cybercrime targeting online banking customers18
Between July and August 2010, some £675,000 was stolen from a bank in the United Kingdom and some 3,000
customer accounts were compromised by cybercriminals. The case, documented by M 86 Security, illustrates that
cybercrime involves a professional business model whereby different members have specific roles, are managed
from an administration panel to operate simultaneously, and where legitimate bank accounts of “money mules” are
used to transfer funds from compromised accounts.

16
17

This is a rather open category in that any offence could involve a computer system in one way or the other.
They also correspond to the categories of offences to be criminalised under the Budapest Convention on

Cybercrime (CETS 185) and the Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation
of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems (CETS 189).

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

The attack involved the following steps:
Criminals infect legitimate websites with malware, create fraudulent online advertisement websites and

–

publish malicious advertisement among legitimate websites.
A user accessing an infected site is redirected to a site from where an exploit kit (in this case “Eleonore

–

Exploit Kit”) is loaded on the user’s computer. This allows the owner of the exploit kit to control what is
loaded to the user’s computer, and is used in this case, to install a trojan horse19. The malware is wellobfuscated, and only very few anti-virus systems were able to detect it.
The computer of the user is now a “bot” (“robot” or “zombie”) from where the trojan reports back to and

–

receives instructions from the command and control server (in this case hosted in a country of Eastern
Europe).
The user accesses his personal bank account, upon which the trojan transfers login credentials, date of

–

birth and security number to the command and control server.
As the user accesses the transaction section of the banking site, the data of the transaction form is sent

–

to the command and control servers instead of to the bank.
The system of the command and control server analyses and decrypts the information and identifies an

–

appropriate money mule bank account.
The trojan receives instructions to send an updated transaction form to the bank to transfer money to

–

the mule account.
Confirmation from the bank that the money has been transferred is also sent by the trojan to the

–

command and control server.

2.2.2

Cybercrime tools and infrastructure

27.
Information on the cybercrime situation and trends, and on the underlying technology and
infrastructure provided by research, industry and public sector reports can be summarised as follows:
2.2.2.1

Malware

28.
Malicious software or malware20 remains the main primary tool for committing cybercrime.
Malware is reported to have evolved into a major industry in itself with a complex economic
infrastructure and well-organised and well-funded criminal gangs.21 Viruses, worms and trojans that
remove security applications, download additional malware or infect files, or that steal login, account
credentials and other data are considered the top malicious code samples.22 Malware evolves rapidly.

19

A Trojan horse is a computer programme that appears legitimate but actually has hidden functionality used to

circumvent security measures and carry out attacks. A trojan horse may enter a user’s computer by presenting
itself as a compellingly attractive tool of some sort, which the user intentionally downloads and installs, unaware of
its ulterior purpose. Trojans typically build in the functionality of keyloggers and other spyware and a range of other
functions to disable system security (Source: OECD (2007): Malicious Software (Malware) – A security threat to the
Internet Economy. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/53/34/40724457.pdf)
20

“Malicious software, commonly known as “malware”, is software inserted into an information system to cause

harm to that system or other systems, or to subvert them for uses other than those intended by their owners”

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

For illustration, Symantec notes that it created more than 450,000 malicious new code signatures in
the period April to June 2010 in order to capture new malware variations. An increasing number of
PCs is infected with malware.23
29.
The web remains the main vehicle for malware. According to Sophos, Internet users are lured
to sites where they are infected by malware. Some of these are compromised legitimate sites from
where users are re-directed to sites hosting malicious webpages. In the second half of 2009, most of
these were hosted in the USA (37.4%) followed by Russia (12.8%) and China (11.2%, compared to
51.4% in 2007).24 Symantec for the period April to June 2010, lists the USA as the top-ranked country
for malicious activity (accounting for 21%), followed by India (6%), Germany (5%), China (5%) and
Brazil (5%). The top web-based attack was related to malicious PDF activity (36%).25 Microsoft reports
for 2009 that in terms of malware and potentially unwanted software the USA with more than 15%,
China (about 8%) and Brazil (about 6%) were most infected. China (+19.1%), Russia (+16.5%) and
Brazil (+ 15.8%) showed the most important increases.26
30.
In terms of e-mail threats, spam remains a major tool for fraud schemes and spreading
malware. Microsoft reports that spam associated with advance-fee fraud and gambling increased
significantly in the second half of 2009. The USA accounted for 27% of spam sent, followed by Korea
(6.9%), China, (6.1%), Brazil (5.8%) and Russia (2.9%).
31.
Most e-mail traffic consists of spam27 and it seems that very few botnets are responsible for
the vast majority of botnet spam sent.28 In the period April to June 2010, Symantec observed 12.7
trillion spam messages, accounting for 89% of all email traffic observed.29 SPAMHOUSE maintains
that:
“80% of spam received by Internet users in North America and Europe can be traced via
aliases, addresses, redirects, locations of servers, domains and dns setups, to a hard-core

group of around 100 known spam operations, almost all of whom are listed in the ROKSO
database”.30
2.2.2.2

Botnets31

32.
Botnets continue to be considered the primary threat with regard to cybercrime and
information security. They consist of groups of individual computers that are infected with a piece of
malware which turns these infected computers into “robots” (bots) or “zombies”32 that are controlled
remotely and without the knowledge of the owners of the computers by the originators or masters of
the botnet (“bot herders”) from command and control servers. The malware may furthermore be able
to scan for vulnerabilities and propagate itself to further systems.
33.
In 2005, the authorities of the Netherlands uncovered a botnet operation involving 1.5 million
infected computers (“bots”)33. In December 2009, the Mariposa botnet was dismantled that consisted
of up to 12 million infected computers.34 The malware monitored activities on infected systems for
passwords, bank credentials and credit cards.35
34.
Through botnets large amounts of spam can be distributed or websites can be paralysed.
They can thus also be used for distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks in order to paralyse critical
infrastructure. At the same time, it is rather difficult to trace attacks back to the originators.
35.
The take-down of the Rustock botnet in 2011, following legal action by Microsoft and other
partners, shows new legal and law enforcement avenues for measures by the private sector and
through public private cooperation.36 Combined with follow-the-money techniques, attribution to
criminals or criminal organisations should be possible.37
2.2.2.3

Domains used for criminal purposes

36.
A further building block of the cybercrime infrastructure is the use of domains for criminal
purposes. These domains are then used for botnet and spamming operations as well as hosting child
pornography and other illegal content and for offering underground goods and services.
37.

30

The misuse of domains for criminal purposes is facilitated by several factors:

“The Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) database collates information and evidence on known

professional spam operations that have been terminated by a minimum of 3 Internet Service Providers for spam
offenses”. http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/
31

See Microsoft Security Intelligence Report, Volume 9, January through June 2010 with a detailed analysis of

botnets (http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/)
32

Commtouch reports that in the first quarter of 2010, some 305,000 zombie computers were newly activated per

day. Brazil (14%), India (10%), Vietnam (8%), the Russian Federation (7%) and Ukraine (4%) produced most
zombies. (www.commtouch.com/download/1679)

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Some domain or web hosting services allow for “bullet proof hosting”, that is, providers do
not cooperate with law enforcement and are lenient towards the activities of their customers
and the materials they upload or distribute.38 Some of those offering bullet proof hosting are
reportedly themselves criminal organisations.39
In many countries, there appear to be legal obstacles to closing down domains. This seems to
be particularly the case if the criminal activities target other countries that the one where the
domain is hosted.
Registrars and registries often fail to exercise due diligence when domains are registered.
Internet resources, such as domain names are managed/coordinated respectively by the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and Regional Internet
Registries (RIRs) and their registrars (e.g. Internet Service Providers). To obtain these
resources, a registrant has to provide certain personal information to the WHOIS database.
According to a recent report for ICANN, less than half of records were fully accurate (only
23% when using strict definition of accuracy).40 Inaccuracies are also found in WHOIS of
RIRs. This hampers law enforcement efforts to track those who use domains for criminal
activities. The arrival of IPv6 is likely to aggravate further this situation, as large amounts of
IP addresses will be distributed under the current registration procedures.41
Even if criminal domains are terminated, criminals are able to transfer their operations
elsewhere.

2.2.2.4

Underground economy

38.
In recent years, an “underground economy” has emerged that provides a market for tools,
goods and services to commit cybercrime and for the sale of stolen goods and information. It
represents a “genuine economic environment” for producers, traders, service providers, 'fraudsters'
and customers”42, and allows criminals to organise themselves. According to Symantec,43 credit card
details were the most frequently advertised item on underground servers in the period April to June
2010 (28%) followed by bank accounts (24%).

Underground platforms furthermore provide drop zones for stolen goods and means for
“cashout”, that is, for turning virtual money into real money.44
40.

Goods and services include:

–

–

Credit cards and other information for the commission of identity-related fraud.
Offshore banking services and the creation of shell corporations.
“Expert services” such as malware development, recovery of data and anti-forensics.
Spamming services, that is, the delivery of spam against payment.
“Bullet proof” web hosting.
Online offering of malware and tools to facilitate or commit other crimes, such as malware
toolkits and fake anti-virus software. Malware toolkits allow non-technically skilled people to
create and deploy a malware that targets online banking services. These malware toolkits
typically contain features like keyloggers, form grabbers and botnet “zombie” software.

2.2.2.5

Money mules

41.
“Money mules” or “financial agents“ are money couriers that form an essential part in the
movement of proceeds from crime between the victim to the offender.45 Mules may be or be not
aware of the fact that they are part of a criminal operation. Their recruitment may take place by
various means; potential mules may be contacted via spam or respond to apparently legitimate
recruitment websites where “financial manager”, “work at home” or similar positions in a fake
company are advertised. Mules may sign formal contracts of employment and be required to deposit
copies of passports and other ID information.
42.
Their primary role is to open a bank account or make their own bank account available. Once
they receive funds in their account they will receive instructions to transfer these funds to other
accounts or abroad using wire transfer services, thereby facilitating money laundering, while keeping a
commission.
43.
It has been argued that “money mules” are the bottleneck of fraud-related cybercrime, and
that not enough mules are available to exploit stolen credit card and other ID information.
2.2.3

New platforms for cybercrime

2.2.3.1

Social networking platforms

44.
Social networking sites and the number of users expanded considerably in recent years46, and
are now also used for spreading malware, offer targets for other form of cybercrime and constitute
security risks. According to Sophos,47 social networks have become a viable and lucrative market for
malware distribution with Web 2.0 botnets stealing data, displaying fake anti-virus alerts and
generating income for criminals. The proportion of companies reporting spam and malware attacks via
social networking increased by 70% in 2009. Employees logging on to social networking sites thus

pose serious security risks to the information systems of their companies or institutions by opening
them up for spam, phishing, malware and data infiltration.
2.2.3.2

Cloud computing

45.
Technological developments create further vulnerabilities to cybercrime. A much discussed
trend is “cloud computing”, that is the migration of data and services from specific computers to
servers “somewhere” in the clouds. This entails tremendous opportunities but has also far reaching
security implications. On the one hand, individual computers will become less attractive targets, but on
the other hand “with more sensitive data being stored on the Internet [..]. there is the potential for
more serious security breaches and for more information to be stolen more rapidly than ever before”.48
46.
The fact that much of the traffic and other data needed for criminal investigations will be
stored on servers in foreign or unknown jurisdictions will render law enforcement very difficult, and in
turn facilitate cybercrime.49
2.2.4

Organising for cybercrime

2.2.4.1

Organised crime

47.
Economic crime has been the primary activity of organised crime groups for many years. The
trend observed since 2004, namely, that criminals increasingly organise to exploit the opportunities of
the Internet and other information technologies continues, the more institutions and individuals use
such technologies for their economic activities.50 Organising for cybercrime is furthermore facilitated by
anonymity, depersonalisation and ease of communication, the possibilities of global outreach for cooperation between criminals for and targeting of victims, the disconnection between the location of the
offender and the victims, and the opportunities for money laundering.
48.
Complex fraud operations, the infrastructure of cybercrime (including botnets and the
underground economy), the level of specialisation and division of roles show the features of structured
organised criminal groups that act in concert to commit offences to obtain financial or other material
benefit.51

Persistent threats against political or economic targets

49.
Threats directed at political or economic targets without immediate economic gain,52 such as
espionage, “hacktivism”, terrorism53, war and conflict by means of computer systems are real
concerns. 54
50.
However, intrusions and denial of service attacks such as those on Estonia in 200755, on
Georgia in 200856, the USA and South Korea in July 200957, the Google intrusion in December 200958
or the intrusion into governmental, business and academic computer systems in India in 2009
illustrate the difficulty of differentiating between crime, espionage59, terrorism and war as long as
attacks cannot be clearly attributed.60 Since these threats are not aimed at generating crime proceeds
they are not dealt with further in the present study.61

52

These have also been named “Advanced persistent threats” or APT. It seems this term was coined by Mandiant, a

US Security firm (http://www.mandiant.com/services/advanced_persistent_threat/). For a brief definition see:
http://www.damballa.com/knowledge/advanced-persistent-threats.php. Also:

For some examples see: http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_16/b4080032220668.htm
53

The use of the Internet for terrorist purpose may include denial of service or other types of attack against critical

infrastructure, the use of the Internet for incitement, recruitment and training for terrorism, or the use of
information technologies for target identification, communication, financing and other logistical purposes.

Financing of terrorism

51.
Terrorist organisations require funding not necessarily for specific attacks but “to meet the
broader operational costs of developing and maintaining a terrorist organisation and to create an
enabling environment necessary to sustain their activities”.62
52.
Terrorists may raise funds through legitimate businesses or charitable entities or a variety of
criminal activities that increasingly involve the Internet, such as the hacking of online bank accounts,
fraud and theft committed with stolen credit card credentials and the laundering of proceeds through
online gambling sites. Websites of charities are reported to be used to raise funds also for terrorist
purposes, and online payment systems are vulnerable for misuse by terrorist organisations.63

2.3

Proceeds generating offences on the Internet

53.
Obtaining financial or other economic benefits has been one motivation of cybercriminals
from the very beginning.64 However, there is general agreement that generating proceeds is now the
primary purpose of cybercrime.
54.
It is difficult to arrive at an estimate on criminal money flows on the Internet and
consolidated studies appear not to available. Certain consideration may lead to the assumption that
cybercrime is perhaps the most profitable field of crime:
–
–
–

–

–
–

–

Societies are dependent on information and communication technology;
Almost any crime can be committed more effectively and with less risk on the Internet;
Some two billion people, most companies, in particular the financial sector, and public
institutions of the world are connected to the Internet.65 They are all potential victims of
cybercrime;
Cybercrime can be committed across boundaries. This reduces the risk of detection. The fact
that victims are abroad limits the interest of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute.
Inefficient international co-operation and weak legislation further reduces risks for criminals;
Cybercrime, including fraud schemes, are increasingly automated and thus do not rely on the
availability of criminal man power;
The underground economy provides inexpensive and easy access to tools needed to commit
cybercrime. More and more sophisticated attacks can be committed with less and less
knowledge;
Cybercrime usually does not require violence or coercion, and is thus less hindered by faceto-face, humane inhibitions.

55.
Based on these considerations, it can be assumed that the economic damage resulting from
cybercrime exceed that of any other type of organised and economic crime. However, economic
damage does not equal criminal money on the Internet. Repair cost, lost productivity, revenue loss,

data loss, reputation effects, infrastructure, patch deployment and development, security measure, law
enforcement and others may be more expensive for companies than the monetary damage cased by
fraud and theft. 66
56.
The following data illustrates the amounts at stake and also points at the need for more
comprehensive analysis and reporting:
From the 146,663 complaints received and referred to law enforcement in 2009 by the US
Internet Crime Complaint Center, 100,206 complaints involved monetary losses amounting to
US$ 559.7 million.67
Complaints compiled through the Consumer Sentinel Network US Federal Trade Commission68
reached 1.3 million in 2009. The amounts paid and lost through fraud schemes exceeded US$
1.7 billion in 2009.
In Germany, the damage of Internet crime actually recorded by the Federal Criminal Police
amounted to Euro 36.9 million in 2009.69
In 2008, airlines are estimated to have had losses in revenue of US$ 1.4 billion due to
fraudulent online bookings.70
Lost revenue due to software piracy has been estimated at US$ 53 billion in 2008.71
A survey covering 45 US companies, published in July 2010, indicates that each company
experiences about one successful attack per week on average with median annual cost of
US$ 3.8 million. External cost are primarily related to the theft of information (42%) and
business disruption and lost productivity (22%), while 46% of internal cost are related to
detection and recovery.72
UK Payments estimated the total payment card fraud losses in 2009 at £440.3 million.73 Of
this, card-not-present (CNP) fraud accounted for £266.4m.

criminalised, but also fraud involving interference with computer data and systems, a specific provision
on “computer-related fraud” was included in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.75
59.
Replies to the questionnaire confirm fraud as the main category of cybercrime in the majority
of respondent countries. For example76:
–

Albania: Fraud with credit cards and fraud via the Internet are reported to be on the increase.
Since June 2009, eight cases involving credit card fraud and 5 cases of fraud through the
Internet have been identified, and 15 criminal proceedings have been initiated, of which
13 cases are computer fraud, including 8 credit card fraud and 5 cases of fraud via the
Internet;
1 case of system interference;
1 case of distribution of child pornography.

–

Andorra: Most cybercrime appears to be related to credit cards (53 investigations in 2009),
followed by fraud via Internet (12 investigations), libel (10 investigations) and child
pornography (7 investigations).

–

Estonia: recorded cybercrime increased from 71 cases (in 2005) to 501 (in 2009), of which
470 were computer-related fraud. Computer-related fraud accounts also for the vast majority
of crimes prosecuted (353 out of 368 cases and 148 out of 159 persons prosecuted in 2009).
In six convictions for money laundering in 2009, the Internet was found to be part of the
offence.

–

Germany: the general German Police Crime Statistics,77 that reflect all offences recorded by
the police, state 63,642 computer crimes for 2008.78 The largest category with 23,689 cases
was fraud using an unlawfully obtained debit card with PIN, followed by computer-related
fraud, that is, fraud involving an interference with computer data and systems, with 17,006
cases. The third category was illegal interception or data espionage with 7,727 cases,
followed by computer-related forgery (5,716 cases) and fraud related to unauthorised access
to communication services (5,244 cases).

75

“Article 8 – Computer-related fraud

Each Party shall adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences
under its domestic law, when committed intentionally and without right, the causing of a loss of property to another
person by:
a

any input, alteration, deletion or suppression of computer data;

b

any interference with the functioning of a computer system,

with fraudulent or dishonest intent of procuring, without right, an economic benefit for oneself or for another
person. “
In some countries, fraud provisions traditionally require the deception of a person or of a human mind, and do not
cover the deception of a computer system. In Germany, for example, a specific article (Section 263a StGB –
Computer Fraud) was therefore introduced in line with article 8 of the Budapest Convention (see: Brunst,
Philip/Sieber, Ulrich (2010): Cybercrime legislation. In: Basedow, J./Kischel, U./Sieber, U. (eds): German National
Reports to the 18th International Congress of Comparative Law, Washington 2010, page 730-731.

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

In the specific situation report on Internet crime for 2009,79 the German Federal Criminal
Police Office (BKA), notes 50,254 crime crimes in the narrow sense, that is, excluding credit
card fraud:
22,963 cases of computer-related fraud (an increase of 35% compared to 2008);
11,491 cases of illegal interception/data espionage (an increase of 48.7%);
7,205 cases of fraud related to unauthorised access to communication services (an
increase of 37.4%);
6,319 cases of computer-related forgery (an increase of 10.6%);
2,276 cases of data interference/sabotage (an increase of 3.1%).
The damage recorded was Euro 36.9 million.80
–

Italy: computer fraud was the main category of cybercrime with 1,753 cases investigated
between April 2008 and April 2009 by the Milan prosecution office, followed by cases of illegal
access (541 cases). In another 1,653 fraud cases computers played an important role (for
example auction fraud).81

–

Lithuania: almost all cybercrime cases were related to fraud (4,586 cases recorded in 2009),
illegal use of means of payment (2,376) and production and unlawful possession of electronic
means of payment (881).

–

Poland: in 2008, 94 new money laundering cases sent by the financial intelligence unit to the
public prosecution office involved the use of Internet (compared to 14 in 2007 and 31 in
2006).

–

Russian Federation: the Ministry of Interior of Russia has intensified activities in this field. In
2008, the department "K" of the Ministry initiated over 5,500 criminal investigations of illegal
activities in the information technology sector, an increase of 20% compared to 2007. In
January 2009, the Department initiated between 50 and 100 criminal proceedings weekly.

–

Slovakia: police statistics do not allow extracting of cases involving computer systems, unless
they involve the misuse and destruction of records on information carriers (including misuse
of login data for Internet banking). 23 such cases were noted in 2008, and 28 in 2009. In
2009, the financial intelligence unit noted 128 cases of unusual transactions related to
phishing and involving money transfer via money service businesses.

–

Slovenia:82 9 cases were investigated and prosecuted for larceny and breaking into computer
systems. In two of the cases, two persons withdrawing cash were convicted for money
laundering by negligence. One case is still under court investigation for money laundering by
negligence and another case is still pending prosecution. The possible proceeds amounted to
Euro 128,500, but the majority of these proceeds were blocked by the Office for the
Prevention of Money Laundering or with court orders and in some cases, banks returned the
proceeds to the original accounts. The actual economic loss thus did not exceed Euro 30,000.
Nine cases were connected to breaking into information systems and two to building fake

USA:83 The IC3 Internet Complaint Center of the USA in 2009 received 336,655 complaint
submissions, of which 146,663 were referred to law enforcement.84 Most of these referrals
were complaints related to the non-delivery of goods and services (19.9%), identity theft
(14.1%), debit/credit card fraud (10.4%) and auction fraud 10.3%). Complaints compiled
through the Consumer Sentinel Network of the US Federal Trade Commission85 reached 1.3
million in 2009, of which 54% were fraud, 21% identity theft and 25% other types of
complaints. Schemes include:
Online dating scams perpetuated through email and dating websites by fraudsters that
pose as young women and engage potential victims in personal communication before
soliciting funds for travel from country of the offender to the country of the victim.
Money transmitters are often used to move the funds. These result in millions of dollars
in fraud loss to U.S. victims.
Online bank theft based on intrusion and account takeover of online financial accounts
to launder millions of dollars through a US-based network of money transfer mules.
Social engineering is often used (via the computer or telephonically) to obtain account
access or elevate account access or gain valuable information such as executives’ email
addresses for targeted identity theft. Crimes may also involve phishing, redirection to
fake websites, account takeover, etc.
Online gambling through the recruitment of US-based players and the exploitation of
the International banking infrastructure (bank checks, wire transfers, money
remittances) which involves the laundering of significant sums of money using websites
and operating from offshore locations.
Manufacture and/or sale of false identification documents (driver licenses, passports,
insurance cards, etc.).
Online services offering offshore banking services, the creation of shell corporations,
web hosting, money laundering, spamming services, and others.
Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) which are launched for a variety of
reasons, sometimes to knock competitors’ websites off-line.
Made to order or “off the shelf” malicious software (malware) to include key loggers,
form grabbers, botnets, etc. in support of identify crimes such as account takeovers
Sale of false anti-virus programmes, pirated software and counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
Credit card fraud and online financial fraud through the theft of personal identifiers and
the exploitation of e-commerce merchants, express shipping businesses, banking
institutions and online payment business platforms such as PayPal and Google
Checkout. Two significant types of crimes that result are:
reshipping of stolen computers, high-tech accessories, fashion accessories, etc.
through an extensive network of reshipper mules based in the U.S. to offshore
criminal ringleaders;

laundering of illegal proceeds from the sale of non-existent merchandise such as
software, videogames, etc. on auction platforms where the merchandise is
subsequently ordered through an e-commerce merchant with stolen identity and
financial information; illegal proceeds are laundered through a large number of
online payment and financial institution accounts in the U.S. and subsequently
sent via wire transfer to criminal ringleaders located offshore.

60.
Another scheme may involve fiscal fraud, whereby cyber-criminals can make fraudulent
claims for benefits by attaching official online systems, such as the self assessment forms. 86
61.
Many types of fraud are thus committed on the Internet and it is difficult to arrive at a
detailed classification. Recent reports suggest that the following phenomena are particularly prevalent.
2.3.1.1

Identity theft

A wide range of fraud involving the Internet and other information and communication technologies is
related to identity theft in one way or the other, whether ID theft is defined as “fraud or another
unlawful activity where the identity of an existing person is used as a target or principal tool without
that person’s consent” 87, “the misuse of the identity (name, date of birth, address, financial
information or other personal details) of another person without knowledge or consent” or as
“assuming the identity of another person by stealing personally identifiable information (PII) to commit
fraud” or as “the theft or assumption of a pre-existing identity (or significant part of it), with or without
consent, and regardless of whether the person is dead or alive”.
62.

Conceptually, ID theft can be separated into three distinct phases88:
1. The obtaining of identity information, for example, through physical theft, through search engines,
insider attacks, attacks from the outside (illegal access to computer systems, trojans, key-loggers,
spyware and other malware), or phishing and other social engineering techniques
2. The possession and disposal of ID information, which includes the sale of such information that now
plays an important role in the e-underground economy where credit card information, bank account
details, passwords or full identities are among the most offered goods
3. The use of ID information in order to commit fraud or other crimes, for example by assuming another
person’s identity to exploit bank accounts and credit cards, create a new account, take out loans and
credit, order goods and services or disseminate malware.

The US Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act (title 18, s. 1028(a)(7) U.S.C.), punishes a person who:
“knowingly transfers or uses, without lawful authority, of a means of identification of another person with the intent
to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a
felony under any applicable State or local law.”

63.
Phishing remains one of the main social engineering techniques used on the Internet to steal
ID-related information for fraudulent use. Variations include “smishing” (mobile phone text messages
to seek the disclosure of information), “spear phishing” (personalised bogus message targeted at a
single individual), “pharming” (redirecting website traffic from a legitimate website to a counterfeit
website to trick users into disclosing information) and “spoofing” (a person or programme is
masquerading as somebody or something else to gain trust and make them enter their details into a
counterfeit website). Financial institutions as well as online payment systems and auction platforms are
the main targeted sectors.89 From a money laundering perspective, one should report a phishing attack
when the information obtained is used to transfer funds from an account to another.
64.
The Anti-phishing Working Group noted some 126,700 phishing attacks in the period July to
December 2009.90 Two thirds of these attacks were the responsibility of the Avalanche phishing gang
which used a technique and an infrastructure for mass-produced phishing sites targeting more than
forty financial institutions, online services and job search providers to obtain identity information. This
criminal enterprise, moreover, combined phishing with the distribution of malware to steal further
information:
“In addition, the criminals used the Avalanche infrastructure to distribute the notorious Zeus Trojan, a
sophisticated piece of malware that the criminals incorporated into its phishing and spamming
campaigns. Zeus is crimeware – malware designed specifically to automate identity theft and facilitate
unauthorized transactions. Potential victims are sent phishing-like lures that purport to offer popular
software upgrades, file sharing services, and downloadable forms from tax authorities (such as the
Internal Revenue Service in the United States, and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs service in the
United Kingdom). If a recipient takes this bait and his or her computer is infected, the criminals can
remotely access that machine, steal the personal information stored on it, and intercept passwords and
online transactions. The criminals can even log into a victim’s machine to perform online banking
transactions using the victim’s own account details. This is difficult for the banks to detect as fraud. This
combination of phishing and malware, advertised by spam, became one of the most insidious
combinations on the Internet.”91

65.
Identity theft-related fraud schemes thus include data interference to deceive computer
systems.
66.
There is no data available at global level on the scale of cyber identity theft, though
information is emerging from some country national assessments92. Of the 146,664 complaints
referred by the US Internet Crime Complaint Center to law enforcement in 2009, identity theft was the
second most referred category (14.1%) after the non-delivery of goods (19.9%).93 The Consumer
Sentinel Network report of the US Federal Trade Commission lists identity theft as the main category
of complaints reported in 2009 (21% or 278,078 of 721,418 complaints received). The most common
forms of identity theft were credit card fraud (17%), government/benefits fraud (16%), phone or
utilities fraud (15%), and employment fraud (13%).

According to Avira, the most phished brand in January 2011 remained PayPal, followed by other entries (ie. Ebay,

67.
Also, the German Criminal Police noted that in addition to phishing in relation to online
banking (2,923 cases recorded in Germany in 2009), modi operandi include “carding”, that is the use
of fraudulently obtained credit/debit card information for fraud (53 cases), account takeover through
the interception of access credentials (617 cases) and the misuse of access data to telecommunication
systems (3,207 cases).94
68.
Identity theft is in many cases closely related to fraud involving payment cards and account
take-over.
2.3.1.2

Payment card fraud

69.

Types of payment card fraud include:

–

Card-not-present (CNP), that is, genuine card details are stolen and then used to make a
purchase via the Internet, telephone or mail order. In the UK, CNP fraud accounts for more
than half of losses through plastic card fraud (UK£ 266.4 million out of total losses of UK
£440.3 million in 2009); most of it committed via the Internet.95
Counterfeit cards fraud occurs when a fake card is created using compromised details from a
magnetic stripe of a genuine card”. In the UK, this type of fraud amounted to UK£ 80.9
million in 2009. 96
Lost or stolen cards that are used in shops not requiring PINs or to commit CNP fraud.
Card ID theft includes the opening of an account in the name of somebody else with stolen or
fake ID documents (“application fraud”) or taking over the credit or debit card account of
another person pretending to be the genuine cardholder (“account take over”)
Mail non-receipt fraud means that cards are stolen while in transit from the sending company
to the genuine card holder.

–

–
–

–

70.

Related criminal conduct includes:

–

Skimming/cloning where individual card details are captured (“skimmed”) and either sold or
duplicate cards are produced (“cloned”). Skimming can take place in several locations
including at ATM machines and at points of sale due to either technical compromise or staff
collusion.
Data breaches where personal identifying information (card numbers, names, addresses,
etc.) is stolen in large volumes from e-commerce merchants, shipping businesses, banking
institutions and other online payment platforms.
Stolen card details are sold in batches with US$1,000 for 100 card numbers being a typical
price.

(http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/files/fraud_the_facts_2010.pdf). An important share of the fraud on UK cards was
committed abroad (UK£ 122.7 out of UK£440.3 million in 2009), primarily in the USA (UK£ 21.4 million). Overall
losses are reported to have decreased by 28% compared to 2008. While this report notes a decrease of 19% in CNP
fraud losses compared to 2008, VISA Europe reports a steady increase in CNP fraud, while other types of card-fraud
are declining (Source: Meeting at the Council of Europe on 22 July 2010).

The stolen card details are often used online to purchase high tech accessories, computers,
jewellery, fashion accessories etc. These items are then typically reshipped by mules
operating in various countries to the criminals.
Another process exploited to take advantage of stolen credit card details is to create a listing
on an auction site for a high value item at a low price. The winner of the auction then pays
the criminal for the item, which the criminal then purchases buys directly from the
manufacturer using the stolen card details.
Illegal proceeds generated through the use of stolen card details are laundered through a
large number of online payment and financial institution accounts and subsequently sent via
wire transfer to the criminals by mules.

2.3.1.3

Online banking attacks, misuse and account take-over

71.

A wide variety of attacks and misuses of online banking facilities have been reported.

72.
The most commonly reported attack vector is phishing. The general form of a phishing attack
involves customers being tricked, through various means, into visiting a fake website, allegedly
belonging to the bank. This can be done both via email and via the telephone. The customer then
enters his or her online banking credentials into the fake website where they are recorded by criminals
and subsequently used to take over the customer’s account.
73.
Most commonly, phishing attacks are untargeted and carried out by sending large volumes of
spam mails. However highly targeted phishing attacks have been observed where individuals or small
groups will be contacted. This is known as “spear phishing”.
74.
Another technique, known as pharming, also involves the redirection of the customer to a
fake website. This process works by interfering with the process used by computers to determine the
IP address for a particular website. The customer’s PC or broadband router can be compromised and
reconfigured to intercept requests for online banking websites, sending the customer to the fake
website rather than the legitimate one.
75.
Another technique is the use of banking Trojans, that is malware that captures the
communication between the customer and the online bank (“man-in-the-middle-attacks”). The
captured account details are transmitted to the criminals. Alternatively, additional instructions can be
injected by the Trojan into the customer’s logged in banking session. This will deceive the banking
computer to issue authorisations since the injected instructions appear to be originating from a
legitimately logged in customer.
76.
Once the customer’s account has been taken over, criminals exploit the compromised account
in various ways:
–

–
–

Money can be transferred out of the customer account which involves the setting up of a new
beneficiary account, usually a mule account, and transferring funds from the compromised
customer account into the mule account.
Applications for credit/debit cards in the customer’s name can be submitted, leading to cash
withdrawals, or point of sale or Internet purchases from the compromised account.
The compromised account can also be used as a mule account.

77.
Finally, weaknesses in the online banking infrastructure can be exploited leading to
compromised customer details.

Mass-marketing fraud

78.
“Mass-marketing fraud” refers to “fraud schemes that use mass-communications media –
including telephones, the Internet, mass mailings, television, radio, and even personal contact – to
contact, solicit, and obtain money, funds, or other items of value from multiple victims in one or more
jurisdictions”.97 It includes schemes such as advance-fee fraud98 or “419 fraud”99, lotteries100, pricewinning schemes and others.
79.
Mass-marketing fraud may target large number of Internet users for relatively small amounts
of money or specific victims or groups of victims for large amounts of money per victim. Losses are
estimated to amount to several billion Euros.
80.
Mass-marketing fraud is often committed by criminal enterprises with information
technologies allowing them to operate and target victims globally. Resources used include legitimate
business services (such as mailing houses), lead lists with contact information (for example from direct
marketing companies), payment processors, communication tools, fraudulent identity and fraudulent
financial instruments. Mass-marketing operations and identity theft are thus connected.
81.
The International Mass-Marketing Fraud Working Group notes that money laundering is a
critical component of various mass-marketing fraud schemes. Victims may be requested to make
payments via cash-based methods (checks, money-orders and others), investment fraud schemes
tend to involve apparently legitimate bank transfers, while West African groups rely on wire transfers
with funds being collected by using forged identification. Payments are channelled through several
jurisdictions to avoid tracking. The International Mass-Marketing Fraud Working Group furthermore
sees an:
“increasing exploitation of fraud victims to receive and launder victim funds, or to receive and disburse
counterfeit financial instruments. A typical mass-marketing fraud scheme, for example, may recruit
individuals to work in such varied capacities as collecting wire transfers, depositing checks or shipping
counterfeit checks to other victims, accepting deliveries of merchandise purchased with stolen credit
cards, forwarding funds and products overseas, and serving as business account agents for foreign
companies.”101

82.
For the US Internet Crime Complaint Center, with 9.8%, advance-fee fraud was the third
largest category of complaints received in 2009.102
83.
In the UK, losses due to mass-marketing fraud were reported to amount to £ 3.5 billion in
2006, affecting an estimated 3.2 million adults.103

Re-shipping fraud is a variation whereby individuals or small businesses are tricked into reshipping goods to countries with weak legal systems. The goods are generally paid for with stolen or
fake credit cards.104
2.3.1.5

Confidence fraud, including auction fraud105

85.
Auction fraud is among the most reported offences on the Internet.106 It involves either the
misrepresentation of a product advertised for sale or the non-delivery of goods purchased once they
have been paid. Often the payment is requested by cash wire transfer.
2.3.1.6

Investment fraud, including stock market manipulation

86.
Stock market manipulation is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation
of the market, creating artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to the price of a traded
entity. An example of the types of market manipulation carried out online is a “pump and dump”
scheme. These schemes usually involve purchasing a large volume of low value stock and then
conducting a spam or telemarketing campaign to encourage the purchase of that particular stock.
When the people behind the scheme sell their shares and stop promoting the stock, the price drops
rapidly and other investors are left with stock worth significantly less than they paid for it.
2.3.1.7

Pyramid and other multi-level marketing schemes107

87.
Multi-level marketing plans are designed to sell goods and services through distributors who
are promised a commission for own sales and the sales of others recruited to join the network. Such
plans would involve actual products and services, but may also be based on fake products. For
example, a pyramid (or Ponzi) scheme requires a financial investment or fee which is returned if
additional people are enrolled in the scheme, and not necessarily through the sale of goods and
services. The scheme collapses eventually once less people are recruited.
2.3.2

Other proceeds generating offences on the Internet

88.
In addition to fraud and financial crime, many other types of crime can be committed and
generate proceeds by means of the Internet in one way or the other.108
2.3.2.1

Child abuse materials

89.
The Internet, including peer-to-peer file sharing networks, has changed the way child abuse

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

growing demand and thus a growing sexual exploitation of children.110 An increasing number of sites
offering child abuse materials is commercial, that is, fees have be paid, often after a “free tour”.
90.
In a Canadian study111 carried out in 2009, 800 commercial sites hosting child sexual abuse
materials were analysed. 89.4% of the images showed children under 12 years. They were hosted at
1,091 unique IP addresses. More than 70% of these were hosted in the USA, followed by Canada
(8.2%), the Russian Federation (3.7%), the United Kingdom (3.7%) and Germany (1.9%). In Poland,
with 80% the largest share of commercial sites compared to non-commercial child sexual abuse
websites was noted, followed by Belgium (75%), Singapore (61.5%), Turkey (57.1%) and Italy
(54.5%). In the report for 2009, the UK Internet Watch Foundation112 48% of child abuse sites were
hosted in North America and 44% in Europe, including the Russian Federation. The main top level
domains used were .com (41%) and .ru (20%).
91.

However, such data may be misleading:
“Although it is not explicitly tracked, Cybertip.ca suspects that some websites hosting child sexual abuse
images operate on fast flux networks. Fast flux domains use nameservers that supply IP addresses that
change quickly and constantly. Typically these are IP addresses of compromised residential computers
that are serving the content of the webpage or acting as a proxy to the content hosted at another
location. This means that a geographic lookup conducted on a website may provide a different result
depending on when it is conducted— even if the lookups occur 10 minutes apart.”113

92.
According to the Canadian study, with regard to paying for child abuse materials, 56.4% of
the sites required traditional credit card payment and 33.3% relied on online payment systems. Some
24% accepted multiple methods for payment.
93.
The Internet Watch Foundation in 2009 processed 38,173 reports, of which 8,844 sites were
confirmed to be related to child sexual abuse. In 2009, 461 identifiable brands were being run as
businesses to profit from the sexual abuse of children.114
94.

110

Spam seems to be a major vector to attract clients to child abuse websites.

To prevent such materials to feed demand, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime thus in Article 9 under child

pornography covers not only actual minors but also images of persons “appearing to be a minor” as well as
“realistic images representing a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct”.

Sale of counterfeit pharmaceuticals115

95.
Counterfeit pharmaceuticals involve medicinal products and medical devices that are falsely
represented as regards identity or source. They are highly prevalent in developing countries, but the
problem is increasingly global.116 It would seem that counterfeits are primarily produced in Asia (due
to the outsourcing of the production of genuine pharmaceuticals to this region). Counterfeits are often
sold in commercial quantities through legitimate distribution chains.
96.
The Internet has led to large increases in the sale and proliferation of counterfeit medicines
globally. This is facilitated by high profits and opportunities, outsourcing, repackaging and distribution
chains, low risks due to weak legislation and slow transborder enforcement, and the involvement of
organised crime groups combined with the anonymity, ease of communication and global outreach
offered by the Internet.
97.

With regard to the Internet the main channels are:

–

Internet pharmacies. Research shows that a large share of e-pharmacies sell substandard or
counterfeit or unapproved medicines.117 The money is paid by customers through online
payment systems to banks abroad.118
Spam or mass marketing fraud. Messages related to pharmaceuticals reportedly account for
81% of the 183 billion spam messages sent per day.119 Pharmacy spam operations relying on
botnets and bullet-proof hosting120 and sending tens of millions of spam messages per day
are listed among the worst spammers globally.121 Spammers may send messages on behalf
of a particular e-pharmacy or act as affiliate advertisers that receive a commission for each
click on a spam message or for actual sales.122

2.3.2.3

Violation of copyrights and related rights

98.
Information technologies and the Internet facilitate the digital reproduction and dissemination
of materials that are protected by copyrights and related rights. Therefore, the Budapest Convention

"А counterfeit medicine is one which is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity and/or

source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit products may include
products with the correct ingredients or with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients, with insufficient
active ingredients or with fake packaging."
(http://www.who.int/medicines/services/counterfeit/overview/en/)

(article 10) requires countries to criminalise such violations if they are carried out on a commercial
scale. Infringements related to copyrights and related rights generate vast amounts of crime proceeds
and are reported to be linked to organised criminal groups.
99.
For example, with respect to software piracy on the Internet, the damage is has been
estimated to amount to US$ 53 billion for 2008 in direct foregone revenues. This does not include the
damage related to cybercrime risks created through unpatched pirate software and the correlation
between malware and software piracy, or revenues lost to legal support and distribution services.123
2.3.2.4

Online extortion

100.
Different techniques are used to extort money from victims through the Internet or other
technology. For example, the information system of a public or private sector institution is the
threatened target or the threat is about the publication of private or harmful information about a
person or institution.124 With regard to businesses, including financial institutions, extortion schemes
tend to involve threat of disruption of networks and websites through denial of service attacks, the
theft of information or reputational threats, including website defacement or publicity on security gaps
in the IT system or the protection of customer information.125 Online payment systems are often used
in this context for the transfer of the extorted money. Such transactions involve money laundering, as
the beneficiary will receive criminal property (ie. proceeds of extortion).
101.
Some examples include anti-malware software whereby users are tricked into installing an
application that loads a warning that the computer is infected and that users should install a new antivirus programme126 which is payable and offers no protection but may on the contrary contain
malware or “Hitman scams” in which victims are threatened that they or family members or friends will
be assassinated unless they comply with instructions to send money via money transfer businesses.127
Reports stress that this phenomenon is on the rise, often involving organised crime networks.
Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where under-reporting is prevalent and there are no reliable
estimates of the scale of extortion.

2.4

Mapping cyber laundering risks and vulnerabilities

102.
Due to the rapid growth and technological developments, the payment systems developed
tremendously in terms of speed of transactions, number and types of service providers, payment
methods, clearing options and even currencies. These new developments of the payment systems offer
opportunities for money launderers and render more difficult the detection of potentially suspicious
transactions. In addition, cyber criminals combine within for the same schemes both traditional and
new payment methods, co-mingling them in multiple operations including cash, bank transfers, prepaid cards, money remitters, e-currencies and other electronic payment systems.
103.
Some payment methods and services can be exposed to a higher ML/FT risk than others,
depending on the degree of anonymity of the transfers, the location of the service provider, the
segmentation of the agents and sub-agents, the relationship with a credit or financial institution in a
jurisdiction observing (or not) the international AML/CFT standards, the quality of supervision, the

AML/CFT rules and regulations in place etc. Different products have different features and those
features can lead to designing the risk profile.
104.
The FATF, in its 2006 report on new payment methods, had listed four potential ML/FT risk
factors in respect of Internet payment systems: anonymous accounts, anonymous funding and receipt
of funds (ATM), high or nonexistent account funding limit, offshore service providers which may not
observe the laws in other jurisdiction. Related risk mitigants included adequate requirements and
processes to identify the account holder, to maintain transaction records identifying the payer and
recipient, to monitor the transactions and report suspicious activities, to limit funding options,
implement account block and limit access to the service. 128
105.
As regards cybercrime and money laundering, the survey responses highlighted in particular
the risks listed below.
2.4.1

Technological risks

106.
The increased and wide access to fast and modern equipment and connections, and the near
ubiquity of the Internet connectivity enhances the ability of the public to initiate a range of financial
transactions in an easy and low cost manner. The technical infrastructure is no longer an obstacle for
consumers’ access to Internet as a valuable information source but equally as an environment for
funds displacement from a person to another or from a jurisdiction to another. Also, the software
products evolved, creating a friendly interface between the public and the on-line based financial
services, so that specific knowledge and computer skills are no longer an obstacle.
107.
The coverage of computer network and information technologies is creating an infrastructure
for the cross border delivery of products, services and funds for legal and natural persons. The relative
easiness with which one is able to carry out cybercrime acts and cyber-laundering is a potential threat.
108.
On the other hand, the information technologies have potential applicability to law
enforcement investigations and supervision activity, but also offer criminals an easy and low cost
access to fast, efficient and increasingly anonymous payment systems. If both criminals and law
enforcement authorities could benefit from Internet based payment systems, the knowledge and the
ease in using those features could make the difference.
109.
From countries’ responses to the survey, it resulted that whilst Police and prosecutorial
offices tend to have specialised divisions, other law enforcement authorities, financial intelligence units
and supervisory authorities might lack sufficient expertise on the functioning mechanisms of such new
payment systems. In the absence of proper supervision mechanisms, difficulties in co-operation with
public Internet services providers (such as cyber cafés, campus networks) have also been
encountered.
2.4.2

Anonymity

110.
When initiating a relationship with an Internet based payment services provider, the direct
contact between the customers and the operator is either non existent or minimal. Those services
conduct a non face-to face business and as a result, they rarely (if ever) know their customers. Users
acquire Internet based financial services through computer terminals and the money inputs and
outputs are performed through an intermediary who could be an distribution agent or a bank.

128

FATF-GAFI - Money Laundering Using New Payment Methods, page 18, October 2006.
34

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

111.
If the intermediary is a bank, the bank doesn’t have any information on the actual
transactions, but can only notice the balance (if any) in relation to the cumulative account of the
provider.
112.
On the other hand, the financial service provider doesn’t know the actual identity of the client
or the origin of the money, as they are allocated based on an identification code.
113.
If the intermediary is an agent (such as retailers selling prepaid cards and cash vouchers),
the funding is made in cash and the identity of the customer is even more concealed.
114.
Therefore, money laundering risks could be mitigated by restricting funding methods to
agents that can be reliable in terms of applying CDD measures, in accordance with the FATF standard.
115.
A vulnerability of the Internet payment services providers resides in the fact that some of the
operators permit opening of anonymous accounts and transfers between different service providers.
Immediately after the opening of the account, the money can be sent anywhere in the world, without
the use of the traditional banking system. Moreover a debit or credit card could be attached to the
mentioned account.
116.
In some cases prepaid cards are designed to afford the customer absolute anonymity while
they can be easily be passed on to unknown third parties, who will become the beneficial owner.
117.
Anonymous funding methods, along with week customer identification data might result in
the lack of or insufficient trail for the transaction and origin and the funds in case of a criminal
investigation and could hamper seriously an money laundering and financing of terrorism
investigations. In such circumstances, the relevant international standards and related national
requirements in terms of know your customer, CDD, and reporting obligations are not adequately
implemented by financial intermediaries. Even if some KYC and CDD measures are put in place by a
number of cyber-payment services providers, the effective implementation is impeded by the fact that
most of the users are occasional clients or they have a short time relationship with the financial entity,
unlike in the case of the banking system.
2.4.3

Licensing and supervision limitations

118.
Numerous responding jurisdictions indicated that internet based payment service providers
are insufficiently regulated and supervised with regards to AML/CFT obligations. Weak or non-existent
regulatory controls in the operating environment is a key risk factor for both institutions and
jurisdictions, coupled with non-existent or inadequate sanctioning regimes.
119.
One of the difficulties in licensing and supervising those entities resides in the fact that often
the jurisdiction of registration is different from the jurisdiction of operation. In some cases even the
lack of specific legal provisions directed to such payment services suppliers could be an issue.
120.
Sometimes, e-payment services providers manage to willingly avoid the legally required
obligations by registering in a “lightly” regulated jurisdiction whereas the financial operations are
carried out in other countries.
121.
Another difficulty in performing a proper supervision of those service providers resides in
their virtual profile. There is no corporal exchange office, no boutique, no point of sale. The role of onside supervision examinations is critical in maintaining the integrity of the financial intermediaries,
including the e-payment service providers. The issue is how to execute on-site inspections on a virtual
commerce. Moreover, in the event of such inspections, new technological means should be available
35

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

for the supervision authority and specialized training should be delivered to the inspectors in order to
achieve effective auditing of the record keeping, proper analysis of the internal procedures in place and
other AML/CFT obligations.
122.
Another issue related to supervision is the legal competence of the supervisory authority over
the Internet payment services providers. One perspective is that the country where the servers are
located should achieve licensing and supervision over the commercial entity providing financial
services. But this optic raises the question of the level of compliance to with AML/CFT requirements of
the respective jurisdiction. Another perspective is that the authorities in countries where the financial
entity offers Internet services should be responsible for supervision.
123.
Licensing is another challenging issue related to Internet based financial services, as the
license is given by the state authority responsible in the jurisdiction where the services provider is
registered, even if the provider “provides” in totally different countries. The issue becomes even more
complicated due to the cross border nature of the various services delivered through the network. A
common view should be put in place in this respect, whereby the question of licensing and supervision
could be somehow well distributed/divided between the jurisdiction of registration and the jurisdiction
of “delivery”.

2.4.4

Geographical or jurisdictional risks

124.
With the expansion of the Internet worldwide, the notion of distance has become increasingly
irrelevant and the wider the geographical reach of the payment system (Internet based or not), the
higher the ML/FT risks. Criminals know those vulnerabilities and find innovative solutions to benefit
from them.
125.
Cross border functionalities render a service quite attractive to launderers as it can also
enables payment service providers to conduct their businesses from jurisdictions where they may not
be subject to adequate AML/CFT regulation and supervision, and where they may be outside the reach
of foreign law enforcement investigations.129
126.
Still money moves from a jurisdiction to another and actual trends of money flows can be
identified. The analysis of the answers provided by countries revealed that some countries are the
departure point for criminal money flows, which might indicate that the victims of the cyber attacks are
located in those regions. Those jurisdictions are usually located in the western part of Europe or North
America.
127.
Other countries appear to be “destinations” for criminal money flows, even though it cannot
be determined at this point if this is the final destination of the money. Cash withdrawals combined
with the use of money mules for the purpose of breaking the trail and dissimulating the trace of the
money, impede the clear determination of the final destination of the money.
128.
However, from the answers to the questionnaire, it is clear that some countries are used as
“hubs” as money flows are constantly directed to those countries, but in the same time, money flows
are generated from those countries to other destinations, some of them unusual for cybercriminal
attacks.
129.
A relation between the destination for the money flows and the origin of the cyber-criminals
was indicated by the countries participating to the survey, which suggests that often cyber criminals
129

FATF-GAFI - Money Laundering Using New Payment Methods, page. 28, October 2010
36

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

tend to sent the money to their families and friends located in their countries of origin. It was also
indicated that cyber criminals tend to operate in neighbouring countries (as for their country of origin),
but also in developed countries even if those are far from their country of origin.
2.4.5

Complexity of laundering schemes

130.
Unlike traditional money laundering schemes involving the use of the banking system, cyber
laundering relies on various types of operations and financial services providers, ranging from bank
transfers, cash withdrawals/deposits, the using e-currencies to money mules and money remitting
services. Therefore, the detection and pursuit of the criminal money flows is much more difficult for
law enforcement agencies.
131.
Often the chain is “broken” by cash operations performed traditionally by money mules
followed sometimes by the use of a traditional payment service. If the respective payment service is
integrated with the Internet payment service provider, then the money could immediately be
exchanged into e-currency ant transferred almost anonymously to other country.
132.
Such a sophisticated scheme might challenge a powerful but “traditional” AML/CFT data
mining software, based on customer transactional behaviour if part of the money laundering chain is
ran in a totally different financial environment.
133.
Internet based payment methods could also separate the source of communication of the
instructions related to the operation from the actual settlement of the money transfer. This will
constitute an additional obstacle for law enforcement officials in the detection phase and when
following the criminal funds.
2.4.6

Other risks

134.
Specific features of the cyber-payment systems could be risk factors in certain circumstances.
The relative easiness of incorporating such a cyber financial system along with the low cost of business
development could lead to questionable profile of the ownership. The speed associated to the
operations including in cases of international transfers could facilitate laundering schemes. The low
cost of such operations could allow low rates for laundering and could encourage possible criminals in
search of legitimising illegal income. The easy conversion to real money and cash in a large range of
jurisdictions might represent a vulnerability to money laundering.

TYPOLOGIES AND SELECTED CASE STUDIES

3.1

Criminal money flows on the Internet and money laundering
methods, techniques, mechanisms and instruments

135.
The Internet-based predicate offences described in the previous chapter generate proceeds of
crime and often the Internet is the place where the laundering process begins. In this process, the
proceeds move from the victim to the offender and from the offender to the other parties involved in
the laundering scheme, before the offender is able to fully dispose of these proceeds.
136.
The rise of cyber criminals and cyber criminal organisations is a new challenge for law
enforcement officials and other key players. In the ICT environment, new crimes develop or new forms
of traditional crimes develop. The increase of the penetration level of the use of new technologies in
the economic and social life of a given country is usually directly proportional with the increase of
cyber related crimes. Adaption of the law enforcements techniques to address new technological
changes, along with strong knowledge on the cyber payments systems are critical to maintain the
investigative capabilities in the new environment.
137.
Cyber criminals use the Internet to launder the proceeds of criminal acts independently from
ICT (money resulting from tax evasion could be laundered using digital currency) or of cybercrime.
Cases received from responding countries indicate that cyber-criminal money, that is proceeds from
cyber-predicate offences, is laundered using different techniques, ranging from the use of traditional
methods such as the banking system or the money service providers to more complex internet enabled
transfers, which often involve organised criminal networks. Most of the criminal proceeds derived from
cybercrime are processed as follows:
–
they are cashed out after multiple transactions, including with the involvement of money
mules to transfer cash or cash equivalents between payment systems in the Internet,
"exchangers", mobile payment systems or settlement accounts of credit institutions;
–
they are used to purchase highly liquid goods, prepayment cards, etc. for further sale to
receive money in cash;
–
they may also be used to purchase through the Internet tickets, travel vouchers, home
accessories, or other items in order either to keep these or to return or re-sell them and
obtain the cash;
–
tart of them is often reinvested in developing new capabilities in order to circumvent security
technologies.
138.
The section below illustrates the most frequently used methods and instruments for
laundering criminal proceeds from cybercrime which were identified by countries responding to the
survey and as such attempts to illustrate the current vulnerabilities in the global financial system to
this type of money laundering. However these should not be considered as being an exhaustive list, as
they reflect only the information received and analysed from available cases gathered by the survey at
the time of receipt. It also includes several cases detected by responding financial intelligence units or
law enforcement authorities’ representatives, illustrating the methods used by criminals to move
criminal money flows through Internet by means of electronic payment systems, often combined with
traditional payment means.

3.1.1

Money remittance providers

139.
The majority of the large “traditional” money transmission services, such as MoneyGram and
Western Union, provide online services. Some informal value transfer networks and underground
banking systems such as Hawala networks also have online presences. The survey replies indicate that
the use of money remittance providers is the most common technique for laundering criminal money
derived from cybercrime, as 10 out of 17 responding countries indicated it autonomously or part of a
more sophisticated scheme.
140.
As the overwhelming majority of wire transfers through money remittance providers is paid
out in cash, this service enables criminals to introduce criminal proceeds into the financial system.
Also, the sheer volume of legitimate cash transactions executed through money remitters provides an
excellent camouflage for money laundering activity in the placement stage.
141.
The money services have simpler client’s identification obligation, and relies on casual
business relation with their clients. Simpler procedures in sending-receiving the money, make the
money services being used by a wide range of people, from cyber launderers, mules or “financial
agents” to less educated people, that find it more difficult to collaborate with an over-regulated
financial institution. Often, the money services are just a part of a more complex scheme, where at
least one cash operation is involved in order to brake the chain and lose the trace of money. Also, in
money remitters schemes, at least one (aware or not) money mule is involved.
142.
Money remittance providers offer inexpensive services, and appear sometimes to impose less
rigorous AML compliance programs than traditional financial institutions. Usually, the money
remittance providers have contracts with banks in order to offer safe and secure contact points with
their clients. Often, they are just a part of a more complex scheme, where at least one cash operation
is involved in order to break the chain and lose the trace of money, with the involvement of money
mules.

Almost all responding countries indicated a typology with more or less similar to the following
Fake job advertisements are sent via spam, applicants being recruited by telephone or by
other non face-to-face procedures. Often the jobs are related to financial issues or advertise
“work at home”.
Criminal proceeds from cybercrime are transferred into the bank account of the mule who is
required to withdraw the amount in cash, and subsequently to send it to a specific beneficiary
via money service providers, while keeping as payment for this service a commission. The
transfers are usually of an amount lower than the reporting threshold, to avoid detection.
Money remitters are used to move the cash to its final recipient.

144.
Some of the identified cases where the services of money remittance providers have been
extensively used have raised concerns about the possible collusion or infiltration by organised criminals
of such businesses in order to organise and facilitate the channelling of proceeds. 130

money remittance services are one of the most regulated intermediaries involved in the cyber
money laundering schemes and thus should have the capacity of providing
valuable
information to FIU and other law enforcements in deterring cyber-laundering.

Case study 1 : Credit card information theft and money laundering
Complaints were received from issuing credit card Company regarding fraudulent use of hundreds credit
cards.
The common compromising point seemed to be a merchant’s POS devices maintenance system.
The audit of the systems revealed the presence of a Keylogger. IP addresses, remote servers and email
accounts have been followed and indicators of a perpetrator located in Romania and clones of compromised
credit cards used in US were found.
In Romania intrusive measures, upon prosecutor’s request have been issued by the judge. The data
communication interception has shown that the perpetrator was collecting credit cards sensitive information
by using a Keylogger and few collector email addresses. The Keylogger was a customized version of an
application downloaded free from the Internet. The credit cards were selected and then sold 1000 USD per
100 pieces* to specific persons located in US. Email communication was found, as well as encrypted
Messenger communication, ICQ and Skype.
The Romanian seller gave instructions for the money to be sent on different names in Romania and Bulgaria
using Western Union services. As instructed the sender name should have been fakes, for avoiding a direct
tracking. Other instructions were for the accomplices in US to send the money to a web money company
which was instructed to execute the exchange and then to redirect the results to Western Union services in
Bulgaria.
During the execution of the house search warrants there have been found computers used by the Romanian
perpetrators, Western Union documentation, and cash. 120,000 USD has been seized
The computer search identified the Keylogger used, data bases with credit card information.
The Romanian perpetrators have been charged for illegal access to a computer system, illegal interception of
a computer communication, fraudulent operation with credit cards and money laundering, all in a continuous
aggravated form.

Case study 2: STR report led to cybercriminals’ arrest
The FIU received two STRs from a commercial bank concerning several cash withdrawals in small amounts
(EUR 500 – 1,000 or equivalent) performed by a natural person A from his bank account. The operations
were preceded by bank transfers, justified as “gifts” or “allowance”, ordered by four individuals from a
foreign jurisdiction.
The bank account held by individual A was monitored for a while, but the bank has not identified other types
of transactions.
In the analysis process, the FIU requested information about the payers located in the foreign jurisdiction in
question and was notified that one of orders was known to have links with people involved in a criminal
group specialized in committing computer crimes. The criminal group’s leader was an individual, known by
the Police as “Samir”. This man along with other co-authors and accomplices were wanted and as a result of
extensive actions, carried by a joint task force, eight persons involved in computer crime were arrested.

40

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011
Facts found in respect of arrested persons:
“Samir” has resided in Italy for a while, where in collaboration with an Italian citizen he had initiated, in legal
conditions, a unit of fast money transfer. Once obtaining the licence for his company, he received also the
username and password necessary for monitoring the transfer operations (MTCN transfers overview). By
these means, he obtained data and information such as: name of the payers, their identification data, the
amount of the money transferred, the location of the departure and the destination of the money. This
information was used for forging IDs, and significant amounts of money were withdrawn from unit
destinations.
In addition to the above mentioned, they cloned the operating system, after installing the license and
certificate (based on digital signature), the resulting image being installed on two laptops which kept the
same configuration (number, model, technical characteristics). The laptops were sold for 100,000 euro each,
as they give the opportunity to the buyers to have access to the same data and information on the persons
performing money transfers, as the legitimate licence holders. The case was submitted to the Court.

Case study 3: Banking transfers, front persons and money mules for money laundering purposes
In phishing/pharming typical cases analysed by the FIU, in the early stages the offender fraudulently obtains
the access to the victims’ bank accounts using Internet banking services.
For concealing their identity, they contact different people offering money for using their personal accounts
for performing transactions.
In many cases, the front persons open a new personal account intended for this purpose and when an
external transfer is being made, they declare the funds as their own.
The funds are then transferred further to other accounts or withdrawn in cash. These intermediaries often
make use of transfers of the funds via money transfer services.

3.1.2

Wire transfers /take over or opening of bank accounts

146.
Even if the new technologies such as the on-line payment platforms or digital currencies gain
more and more ground in the day to day economic and social environment, cyber criminals and cyberlaunderers are still dependent on the banking and financial system.
147.
Wire transfers are a fast and efficient instrument for money launderers and are used most
commonly at the beginning of the laundering process, as often the cybercrime itself consists in
extracting money from victims’ bank accounts using fraudulent techniques. Following this stage, the
money is quickly transferred into the recruited mules’ accounts and from there they are withdrawn in
cash and/or forwarded to other destinations. If sent to other jurisdictions, transfers that are made
are often of small amounts, below the reporting threshold, to avoid having to justify their
origin.
148.
Cases were reported where a number of transactions were made to conceal the illegal origin
of the funds. In some cases, it was determined that perpetrators used several on-line banking
accounts. Sometimes, the cyber-launderers execute hundreds of meaningless transactions across
various bank accounts, followed by a limited number of cash withdrawals. In such cases, it is believed
that all the on-line banking transactions have been carried by one mastermind in the background of
the operation, while the cash withdrawals are entrusted to low profile members.

In other cases, bank accounts have been taken over by an attacker can be used as a “mule”
account, most of the times, this being done without the knowledge of the account holder.

Case studies show that :
most of the times, the banking system is the target of cybercriminals, and it is also used in
money laundering process.
cyber criminals are still depending on the banking system so strengthening the AML culture in
relation to cyber attacks and cyber laundering features, could lead to limiting the
phenomenon.
The wire transfers are used in combination with other techniques.

Case study 4: Phishing and money laundering using bank accounts
A criminal group gathered user data and passwords by using keylogger type viruses. Botnets were widely used.
Using the stolen data, money was extracted from victim’s bank accounts. Subsequently, the money followed a
series of bank transfers and at the end of the chain the criminals performed cash withdrawals. In some cases the
stolen assets were converted into e-currency and back.

Case study 5: Embezzlement on bank accounts
Two nonresident companies (Invest1 and Invest2) transferred funds in small amounts (100 - 200 USD) from
country “Z” to an account opened with “Bank U” by the non-resident “Y” with a purpose of payment “aid to
relatives”.
After the successful funds’ transfer from accounts of companies Invest1 and Invest2, transfers of larger amounts of
funds (200-300 thousands USD) were made. These funds were transferred to the same bank account, and when a
sufficiently large amount was reached, the client “Y” tried to withdraw money in cash.
“Bank U” monitored these transactions and requested additional documents to client “Y” in order to clarify the
purpose of the money transfers. The bank stopped the outgoing transactions on the account for 2 days. Also, “Bank
U” reported the case to the FIU.
Based on the financial analysis performed, the FIU decided to prolong the withdrawal suspension period for 5
working days. During the analysis, it was established that the money was illegally transferred from accounts of
Invest1 and Invest2 and that there was an unauthorized access to the accounts of these companies through their IP
addresses (place of residence – country “Z”). It was identified that the non-resident “Y” has several passports.
According to the correspondent bank information, the money transfers were illegal and the payer’s bank asked for
the return of the funds. During this period of time, an email was sent by unknown person “N” to “Bank U” with
attached copies of contract with the purpose to confirm the legitimacy of the money transfers (contract of financial
aids from companies Invest1 and Invest2 to citizen “Y”). After the analysis of the contract sent by “N”, the name
and surname (second name), as well as a nick-name of the email’s sender were established. The IP address of
email sender was identified. Also, through social networks, it was established that “N” is a friend of a “Bank U”
employee, a CV was found etc. In addition, during the information exchange with counterparts, it was established
that “N” was under suspicion on fraud operations.
Conducting further investigation, the FIU received information that computers of companies Invest1 and Invest2
were infected by a virus Trojan Spam Malware that contained harmful software. This virus was launched to receive
an access to the companies’ software and to control the online account of companies Invest1 and Invest2.

Case study 6: Internet fraud and money laundering using front persons
The case illustrates cyber fraud followed by money laundering and involving an organised group which misused the
Internet for committing criminal activities and opening bank accounts in several EU member States.
The criminal group created websites for Internet sales or made use of existing web pages (such as E-Bay), opened
personal bank accounts in financial institutions within EU Member States requiring as services Internet banking,
SMS notifications and issuance of debit card. The typical goods sold via Internet included electronics such as iPods,
mobile phones, navigation systems, used cars, tractors or caravans. The suspicion arose from the low price and
communication via email or the use of pre-paid SIM cards. They also sent fraudulent banking confirmations as well.
The criminals asked for the payment to be made into an account opened in another EU country. These accounts
were opened in those countries by front persons with low social status.
Once the payment was made, the money was withdrawn in cash by the front persons or immediately transferred to
the account of another criminal group member. After few such transactions, the accounts were closed. The front
persons used for opening those accounts were alternated.

3.1.3

Cash withdrawals

151.
The increased transparency associated with wire transfers and recently with money remitting
services is a factor determining money launderers to consider cash a key element in moving assets
and disguising their traces. Cash clearly remains a part of the cyber-laundering chain according to the
countries’ responses to the questionnaire, and it could be identified in all three stages of the money
laundering process.
152.
In some instances the proceeds from cybercrime (for example in the case of card-related
fraud), is immediately withdrawn in cash from the ATM, in relatively small amounts. From this point
the laundering process begins.
153.
The same procedure is applied in the case of "phishing transfers" that are made to
accumulating bank accounts hold by the financial agent. The financial agent withdraws the money –
deducting his commission - in cash. He subsequently purchases anonymous credit vouchers of an
Internet payment system at various issuing offices (like petrol stations, kiosks) in relatively small
amounts (less than 500 €) (Germany).
154.
Another identified typology mentions the cash withdrawals as part of the layering stage, as
wire transfers are followed by cash withdrawals and the rest of the money laundering scheme
continues in various ways, such as with the use of money remitters, currency exchange etc.
155.
In other cases, the money is cashed out after multiple transactions, including those
involving money mules, in order to transfer cash or cash equivalents between payment systems in
the Internet, "exchangers", mobile payment systems or settlement accounts of credit institutions
(Russian Federation).
156.
However, apparently, for cybercriminals, cash has a number of shortcomings such as the
necessity of direct contact between traders, the weight of large amounts in small notes or the need of
physical movement of the notes by a carrier in exposing circumstances, such as the cross border
transportation where police and custom checks could be performed. Another constraint is related to
the distance between the participants in the transaction. But probably the most important downsize
43

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

that it cannot be stolen by cybercriminals in the form of banknotes. The cyber-attacks by “definition”
are targeting more subtle forms of value, such as bank accounts, IPS accounts, e-currency etc… The
cyber criminals are not pick-pockets, they do not steal paper money because they activate in a
different line of business. However, they use cash to disguise the money trail. Cyber criminal cash is
presented in relatively small amounts and is used in money laundering schemes in a way opposite to
smurfing. The small amount of cash is withdrawn from bank accounts or sent via money remitting
services, in order to be forwarded to “accumulating” accounts.
157.

Case studies show that :
Cash manipulation is a compulsory stage in a cyber money laundering scheme;
ATM are often used in cash withdrawals, to avoid personal contact with bank employees;
The main target in cash interference in a money laundering scheme is concealing the trace of
the funds.

Case study 7: International phishing attack using bank accounts and cash withdrawals
Using phishing attack or other type of stealing of credit card ID, the offender transfers small amounts of money
from targeted accounts in favor of his personal account or account of a company controlled by him or on behalf of
which he/she is empowered to perform financial transactions in another country. Subsequently the offender quickly
withdrawals the money in cash using ATMs in a different jurisdiction from the one where the stolen money was
transferred. He could make several other transactions in order to disrupt the identification of cash tracking.

Case study 8: Organised crime group specialised in fraud on money remitting services, phishing,
fraudulent use of credit card information and forged credit cards
Police intelligence led to the identification of an organized criminal group in a large city, specialised in ATM
manipulation and fraud. The intelligence was validated by additional information received from the FBI attaché,
regarding electronic payment system fraudulent transfers.
Subsequently, a major bank and its clients became victims of a phishing attack, consisting in cash-out from ATMs in
two major cities of the country. Additionally, police information and ad hoc police survey led to the detection of a
fraudulent skimming device installed on ATMs in a third important city. Information gathered conducted to the
conclusion that the perpetrators involved belonged to different criminal groups, but worked together in some
instances.
The investigation determined that the criminal activity of the groups consisted in phishing (targets and instrument
used were identified), fraud on money remitting services, fraudulent use of credit card information and forged credit
cards, manufacture of skimming devices and their use for collecting personal identification data and passwords.

3.1.4

Internet payment services

158.
The expression ‘internet payment services’ (IPS) is generally used to describe Internet
banking-style transfers (payment services that rely on a bank account, the Internet being only the
channel used to give order for the money movement from the payer to the beneficiary) and other
payment services provided by a non bank institution operating exclusively on the Internet and that are
indirectly associated with a bank account.

44

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

159.
In case of IPS bank account related, the transfers are performed similarly to any bank
operation, the only specific feature being related to the location of the bank customer in front of the
computer and not in the bank’s offices.
160.
The non-bank IPS (such as Pay Pal) offer to their customers a range of services of fund
transfers including cross border transfers, on line shopping, participation to on line auctions etc. Some
non-bank IPS allow customers to hold accounts, in which case they may pool those customers funds
into a single bank account, held in the name of the service provider. In that case, the bank holding the
IPS’ account may have no direct relationship with the service provider’s individual customers, in which
case identification or CDD measures in relation to the individual customers are not performed.
161.
As the responses to the questionnaire revealed, the use of internet payment services in
responding countries is on the increase, thus raising issues of an increased risk of misuse for ML/TF
purposes and specific vulnerabilities rendering possible ML both in the context of the placement and
layering stage. Often, the conversions related to the electronic payment systems is an important part
of the layering stage. Such services allow customers to send or receive funds through a virtual account
accessed via the Internet. Such services have sometimes a high degree of anonymity and are
increasingly used to support person-to-person transfers.
162.
Although IPS offer a cheap, anonymous and very quick method for international money
transfers, they may not be subject to the same AML/CFT measures and supervision as the credit and
financial institutions, which makes them vulnerable to money laundering risk. Even though IPS are
offering financial services to their customers, not all suppliers are subject to AML/CFT regulation.
163.
One “chartered” system of laundering money by using Internet payment platforms is that the
money derived from various cyber-offences is wired to the bank account of the financial agent or
money mule, followed by a cash withdrawal. Subsequently credit vouchers of an Internet payment
system are purchased without the obligation of the seller to identify of the buyer. In this way, real
money is converted to virtual money. The financial agent sends the voucher number by e-mail to the
person giving instructions. Subsequently, the PIN can be used for Internet payments of goods and
services, poker, casino and gambling websites on the Internet. Several vouchers for smaller amounts
can be used jointly and combined. A conversion to other digital currencies by using various exchangers
acting on the Internet is also possible. (Germany)
164.
Sometimes the criminal funds are deposited into accounts of such entities, from which the
money is used to buy products and services on Internet auctions. Although the payment services
guarantees safety, the transactions cause a risk of fraud due to the impersonal nature of Internet
commerce and the gap in regulatory treatment by jurisdiction. (Poland)
165.
A recent development relation to IPS is that they become increasingly interconnected with
different new and traditional payment services. Funds can now be moved to or from a variety of
payment methods, ranging from cash, money remittance businesses, digital currency, wire transfers or
credit cards. Furthermore, some IPS providers have started to issue prepaid cards to their customers,
thus granting them access to cash withdrawals through the worldwide ATM networks.131
166.
Depending on the legal requirements on the jurisdiction where the IPS is registered, they
might be regulated as money services businesses and required to have AML/CFT compliance policies
and regulations, maintain certain transactional records and report suspicious financial activity.
167.

Case studies received show that :

IPS accounts and transactions can be misused for fraud and money laundering purposes in a
similar manner as the bank accounts
Due to the link between bank accounts and IPS accounts, preventive measures taken by the
banks could have positive effects on IPS
The use of relatively small amounts is typical for fraud and money laundering using this
technique

Case study 9: Identity theft and money laundering
A Pay Pal account was opened in a branch of a foreign bank. The account was debited with many transfers into
accounts of a number of beneficiaries (according to order).
Modus operandi of the shady business consisted in changing middle (i.e. from 12th to 17th) digits of the account,
checksums (check digits), names of beneficiaries and their addresses, while the last 9 digits and the bank code
(digits from 3rd to 11th) remained the same. There were a few (max. 10) transfers, the value did not exceed 3000
PLN (equivalence of ca 1000 USD).
After a couple of days, the accumulated funds were wired into accounts of a few organizers or were withdrawn in
cash.
As it was established, the funds originated from the American Pay Pal accounts belonging to different individuals.
Having stolen their identity (identity theft), the criminals opened Pay Pal accounts on their behalf, then a motion to
open a credit line was made on the behalf of victims. Material was sent to public prosecutor’s office.
As a result, the bank implemented a system of automatic verification of the beneficiaries’ accounts in case of
incoming transfers, and this preventive measure forced offenders to change their modus operandi. The criminals
started to open lots of Internet-access accounts in different banks (a record-holder opened 1 main and 261
auxiliary accounts). The accounts were credited with wire transfers coming from the Pay Pal account. Accumulated
funds were transferred into accounts of few organizers from which were withdrawn in cash.
Follow-up material was sent to the Public prosecutor’s office. 48 accounts belonging to one of the criminals were
blocked. Police found out that the shady business was organized and controlled by a person who was a sort of
specialist in banking and/or IT systems. The participants lived in the same district of the town and were well-known
to the local police. As for the technical details, the identity theft crime was committed using botnet.

Case study 10: Use of digital goods and defrauding their seller in a way that allows criminals to obtain
directly legitimate funds
The victims: a set of Credit Cards holders, an e-payment company, and a VoIP Company
The scheme: Fraudsters own several companies that offer Premium Phone Numbers. They set a large number of
relays around the world, mostly in poorly regulated countries, and they start calling these relays from zombie PCs’,
using VoIP accounts funded with fraudulent Credit Cards used through the e-payment system.
Comments: The calls generate actual revenue for the Premium Numbers’ providers. These companies can
legitimately assert that they have no ways to check that calls to their destinations are fraudulent or not. Moreover,
if these calls come from all over the world, it is very difficult to find a commonality.
The e-payment system sees transactions with VoIP providers, but has no way to check if these are fraudulent or

46

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011
not, beyond its usual anti-fraud checks. And the VoIP Company sees only the relays, but not the final destinations.
If the relaying infrastructure is built prudently enough, there is almost no risk for the fraudsters to be uncovered.
And as a result, from an ML/TF perspective, we have the proceeds of a crime, the theft of Credit Cards details,
which are transferred to the legitimate economy of a given country without having to go through the Financial
System, and be exposed to its anti-money-laundering controls.

3.1.5

Money mules

168.
Money mules are an essential element of a substantial number of criminal operations on the
Internet as pointed out by most respondents to the questionnaire. According to the survey, the
« mule » is an individual recruited through the Internet, who is requested to open a bank account
whereby he/she will act as an intermediary for cash recovery of the dirty funds obtained by cyberpirating (phishing, keylogging, scam). The mule would then transfer the remaining money to other
accounts or abroad via wire transfer while keeping a commission. Mules receive in their bank accounts
funds from, for example, a compromised online bank accounts and can either forward the funds to
other accounts or withdraw the funds as cash and subsequently using another means such as a money
transmission system or digital currency. The mule keeps a commission as part of the transaction.
169.
Often, the mule and the victim whose bank account is to be defrauded, live in the same
country. For each transaction, the mule receives a commission which was estimated as ranging from 5
to 10 percent of the total of the laundered amount (which will also allow the perpetrator to blur the
links) and is required to transfer the remaining sum via a web-money service. However, several cases
have shown that this percentage seems to have increased over the years, ranging from 30% to 50%
in certain cases, probably due to the increased risk of being detected as a result of an increased
efficiency of enforcement agents’ action or possibly as raised by some persons, the difficulty of
recruiting a sufficient number of mules on the market.
170.
The mule is often described as a credulous individual who is deceived by the professional
contacts with his “employer” and believes that he or she is working for a legitimate company. But this
naïve image has now more and more been questioned by the police bodies and bank officials, as there
have been numerous instances where it became apparent that the mule was fully aware of the illegal
nature of his/her deeds.
171.
There are several scenarios through which mule accounts can become involved in handling
proceeds of crime. The account holder may be fully aware of the true nature of the funds and the true
purpose of their actions or they may not. In cases where they are not, the mule has been contacted as
a result of a legitimate recruitment website where roles such as “financial manager” or “work at home”
positions are advertised. Spamming services are also used to advertise for potential money mules.
172.
After recruiting the mules, the money is sent into their accounts with different orders. They
can be instructed to transfer the money to an account abroad, to transfer the money to a tame
account in the same bank during weekend, to take out the cash from an ATM – using the card usually
for less than an hour, to move the criminal money forward using the remitting to it final destination.132
173.
The number of mules increases directly proportional with the Internet fraud. If the
“employer” will appreciate that the mule is not behaving as a “money laundering specialist”, it will use
him/her only few times so that the amounts gained will not be higher than 3.000 USD.

174.
However, some cases reported show also that money mules operations can involve a certain
level of complexity as far as the structure is concerned, with several levels of mules and duties. Also,
apart from “one-time” mules, which includes case cases where individuals believed to be involved in a
work-at home scheme, there appears to be a growing class of professional mules that knowingly
develop a lucrative business from such schemes.

Case studies and information received indicate that :
money mule activities are often part of a wider and more complex money laundering scheme
and can be a week link in the cybercrime laundering process.
their activities can be detected and be linked to identify transnational criminal operations as
well as botnets and servers used for criminal purposes.
the mule’s activities have a series of typical features that make them vulnerable to
identification by bank’s staff, though transactions require close scrutiny as the amounts
involved are quite small.
money mules recruitment takes place in the majority of countries and is no longer primarily
concerning less developed countries, this trend being explained as potentially resulting from
various factors (ie. consideration that a transaction from a person/money mule from a
developed country would attract less attention in transaction scrutiny, global financial crisis,
lack of sufficient number of money mules).
international financial investigations combined with high-tech crime and cyber-forensic
investigations appear to be the most effective way to achieve impact.

Case study 11: Automated Clearing House (ACH) fraud and money laundering using botnets and money
mules
In March 2009, in the USA, apparently unrelated intrusions into two county school computers (the system of the
country Treasurer and in a county college system) with a combined loss of more than US$ 790 were reported to the
Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).
In one case, money was transferred to seven individuals who were confirmed to be money mules who had been
recruited via seemingly reputable job hosting sites. Further IC3 analyses revealed that more than 200 complaints
were linked to these mules.
Additional analyses by the National Cyber-Forensics Training Analysis (NCFTA) found that the Internet Protocol
addresses from where the victims’ computers were accessed were part of the Ligat botnet. This established a link
between these cases as well as other intrusions in which the stolen credentials of victims were used to authorise
ACH transfers. The analysis of IP addresses linked to the Ligat botnet revealed further connections to
pharmaceutical spam operations to infect computers with malware, and to an underground carding forum and credit
card dumps.
The following method was used in these ACH fraud cases:
–

Targets were small businesses, schools, agencies of cities, counties and states

–

Computers were infected with malware via spam sent via the Ligat botnet through which they became
part of this botnet

–

Stolen credentials were used to authorise ACH transfers

–

The money was transferred to mule accounts

–

The mules had been offered jobs by email after they had posted their CVs on reputable job posting sites

–

Front-companies offered work-at-home employment

–

ACH transfers were made to seven to nine mules with each transfer under US$ 10,000

–

The mules then conducted wire transfers to two or three individuals with each transfer remaining under
US$ 3,000. The transfers were sent repeatedly to several countries (ie. Czech Republic, Moldova, Russia,
Tajikistan and Ukraine).

–

Mules had access to an online “task management service”

The “task manager” instructed the mules which wiring company to use, bank account to open, names
and locations to transfer the money.

Case study 12: Home banking fraud and money laundering involving botnets, mules and VOIP
A bank offers online banking services to their customers, so that they can manage and make transfers from their
homes via computers. Some customers had their account “hacked” and money was transferred from their account
to accounts in other countries. The computers of the victims had been infected with malware which allowed the
theft of account credential and other personal information (probably as part of a botnet). The international
investigation conducted in the involved countries revealed a large and complex system of money mules spanning at
least ten countries and large amounts of stolen money.
Mules were recruited via spam in different languages offering easy gain of money. Those who responded were
contacted by telephone via Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VOIP) which is difficult to intercept and for which bills had
been paid with skimmed credit or stolen debit cards. The “first level” mules were asked to open a bank account.
Within a few days they received money on this account. They were contacted again and instructed to withdraw the
money and transfer it via money remittance providers to a given address in Eastern Europe jurisdictions. In
Belgium, this breaking of the paper trail is considered money laundering.
The “second level” mules, in this case most of them located in Eastern European jurisdictions, withdraw the money
and give it in cash to a third person, the “money collector”. Neither the first nor the second level mules know any
details about the origin of the money. The money collector is electronically informed about the amount to be
received, the transaction code of the money remittance provider, and of the name and address of the first and
second level mules. The money collector transfers the money to a fourth person, the e-banker, who converts it into
Web money. In the case investigated, the money collector received US$ 150,000 within two months.
All these processes appear to be very well organised and automatically followed up, so it can be assumed that the
organisation involves a central data manager or similar.
Comments:
–

This case comprises computer data and system interference into computer systems, illegal interception,
forgery and fraud, money laundering and organised crime.

–

The fact that apparently unrelated minor cases of online transaction fraud were all related and part of a
complex transnational criminal operation became only visible when several prosecutors and police
authorities investigated their cases and made contacts with counterpart services abroad. Joint
investigation teams (for example through Eurojust) in this context prooved very useful.

–

In Belgium, contacts and information exchanges were established between the prosecution, police,
financial intelligence unit, money remittance providers, banks and Europol. Information was gathered and
analysed by a multi-disciplinary team of financial and high-tech crime investigators.

–

Investigating money mules seems to be the most promising point of entry to uncover complex criminal
operations.

–

Following the money trail, that is, financial investigations, are as important as carrying out high-tech
crime investigations and computer forensics, and the success appears to come when combining both.

–

Even though VOIP is difficult to track, companies such as SKYPE may have details about a fixed
telephone line or an address to which an invoice is sent and that is connected to a VOIP account.

–

Furthermore, servers hosting criminal web sites should be investigated. In this particular case in
Belgium, the server investigated hosted a site that directed criminals to other sites offering tools for
“hacking” into the systems of specific banks and lists of potential money mules that had responded to
spam.

International transfers

176.
The international transfers could be analysed as a variety of bank transfers, but since the
recent new payment methods development, in fact, international transfers can be performed using
bank accounts but also e-currency, Internet payment services or traditional money remitting services
as well. Regardless of the payment method, the international transfer of the funds have specific
features and vulnerabilities regarding money laundering risks and this method was mentioned
separately by the countries participating to the survey.
177.
One key problem in relation to international transfers regards difficulties for law enforcement
agencies in recovering the criminal assets when jurisdictional issues arise.
178.
The international “shipment” of the money is usually a part of the layering stage, and follows
after operations previously carried out, for example, the use of money mules.133
179.
In terms of international transfers, it is often that several countries participate in
international-scale arrangements. For this reason it is hardly possible to identify the criminal who
"leads the game", who has invented the scheme and coordinates money transfers.134
180.
It is also difficult to trace the money once it been sent abroad. A particular vulnerability was
noted in relation to some jurisdictions as regards the fraudulent payments with money subsequently
transferred to accounts of companies residing in off-shore zones.135
Case study 13
The FIU conducted an investigation concerning a fraudulent scheme established by an unknown person who
engaged in embezzlement of funds with illegal usage of computers. Further on, the embezzled funds were
transferred in favour of a certain natural persons. Available funds on the account of Company X (Country W) were
sent by unknown person who accessed to on-line bank account of the victim company via login and transferred
unauthorized international transfers to accounts opened by natural persons with an Ukrainian bank.
A series of international payments were performed from Company’s X bank accounts (Country W), in favour of a
number of natural persons in Ukraine. The unauthorised transfers were performed by an unknown person who
accessed the on line bank account of Company X via login. The total amount of the transactions was 577 000 USD.
The payer’s bank in Country W revealed the unauthorized transfers and informed the Ukrainian bank. Funds in
value of 284 000 USD were successfully returned. Furthermore, there were another two unauthorized transfers to
98 000 USD each from the account of Company Z, that were transferred in favour of these Ukrainian natural
persons.
The FIU detected indicators of fraudulent financial transactions in the course of their financial analysis which was
performed also using intelligence from international counterparts.

3.1.7

Digital/electronic currency

181.
Digital or electronic currencies refer to a value exchange system that operates electronically.
Electronic currency is encrypted code representing the value attached to the certain “account”, just as
regular banknotes are a piece of paper carrying certain characteristics that transforms it in a symbol of
value. Some say that electronic money is real money just as the paper bills are, but in fact they are
not as “liquid” as the cash. Electronic currency can only be used in definite circumstances (e.g. need of
available technical devices), whilst the cash can be used in any payment operation.
182.
Global electronic money transfer services are accessible to people all over the world and
make possible to move values from one country to another near instantaneously, sometimes without
leaving a trace. Using electronic currency both natural and legal persons can send and receive
electronic money in real time. Payments can be made 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, fast,
anonymously, with low costs, without leaving the house.
183.
There is a wide variety of digital money providers that purport to link their “currency” to
various precious metals, and another category that does not explicitly link it to precious metals. Both
categories of service providers seek legitimacy and customer trust through the Global Digital Currency
Association, a trade association of digital currencies dealers and exchangers pressing for selfregulation. The GDCA provide a public ranking of its membership and offers arbitration procedures.
“However the GDCA constitution makes no mention of AML policies and procedures or of adhering to
international AML recommendations such as those promulgated by FATF”136.
184.
As stated above, the electronic currency and anonymous payment systems are divided in two
categories: the “trust” type and the ”precious metal” type. The first one relies on the trust between the
seller and the buyer. There is no “exchange rate” for such a currency and it had no value to others but
for the individuals and companies that use it. (137
185.
The second has a guarantee in precious metals attached it is related to the gold value, in
order to determine an exchange rate for the electronic currency, such as Egold and Pecunix. Once the
conversion is made, the funds and the accounts are impossible to trace. Besides, some companies
offer the possibility to link the electronic money account to a debit card that can be used in stores and
ATMs identified in the Interac,138 Cirrus, Maestro and Plus, such as GetEMoney.139
186.
Cyber criminals and money launderers tend to use systems such as digital or electronic
currency which afford varying degrees of anonymity depending upon the issuer, and typically afford
them instant clearing and little or no chance of reversed charges. Some of the systems historically
used by the criminal underground include, but are not limited to, e-Gold, WebMoney.ru, Liberty Dollar,
Pecunix, Liberty Reserve, Fethard and E-Bullion.140
187.
Similarly, commodity backed alternative currencies such as the liberty dollar are attractive for
many of the same reasons. The easy conversion to various virtual currencies and accounts by so-called
"exchangers" offers an effective opportunity to criminals to conceal illegal funds.141

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

188.
On the Internet sites and forums most frequently visited by cyber launderers are, e-gold, and
Webmoney. In some jurisdictions, those businesses are not bound to AML/CFT legal obligations
(submitting STRs, performing CDD or reporting operations above a certain threshold).
189.
In some jurisdictions e-money payment services can be used anonymously. It should also be
noted that e-money circulates outside banks and, as such, outside the bank supervision system. Banks
serve as agents, letting the money in or out of the e-payment systems, and in certain cases – as
"issuers"/emitters of e-money.142
190.
There are instances where the AML/CFT legislation does not include e-payment systems
providers into the list of entities that carry out operations with monetary and other assets and, as
such, they are not subject to the above-mentioned relevant AML/CFT requirements. These gaps allow
for the use of electronic money for legalization of proceeds from fraudulent transactions in the Internet
(such as financial pyramids, personal data theft of Internet users owning bank cards or e-purses with
the possibility to further use them for illegal financial transactions), illegal dissemination of no-license
products in the Internet, stealing money from bank accounts (by breaking banks' software), stealing
money from e-purses of customers of the Internet payment systems, illegal activities off-line
(misappropriation of budget funds, illegal activities, etc.).
191.
Organizers of e-payment system carry out virtually no control over their clients' activities who
provide goods and services on-line. That provides for favorable conditions for illegal and shadow
activities in the Internet.
Case study 14
The Ministry of the Interior received information from WM Transfer company that an unidentified user of their
system violated the contract with the administrators of system and committed stealing of funds to the amount of
$60 000 from the company’s account, and opened in US payment system E-GOLD. The offender replenished the
account of a credit card using the WM Transfer payment system service, and then cashed in the money.
Law enforcement agencies detained an individual who attempted to receive money of the amount of $14 000 in a
bank, illegally using the passport and payment card of another person. The passport, sim-cards for mobile phone
and bank payment card were confiscated. An IP address was identified, through which an illegal access to Internet
and use of computer equipment were conducted. The equipment was used with a purpose to appropriate one’s
property (title marks of “exchange office” purse) involving fraud.
As a result of the investigation, the Ministry of Interior initiated a criminal case under Article 361, Chapter 2 of the
Criminal Code. Two individuals were apprehended: a person of Caucasian region, who organized the withdrawal of
money through the ATM network using counterfeit and lost passports of citizens of Ukraine; and another person,
who was convicted for a term of 3,5 years for committing an analogical offense and was released due to the
probation period. The criminal case with indictment was forwarded to court.

Purchase through the Internet

192.
The relationship between on-line payment services and on-line merchants is of a bilateral
nature. The payment services are emerging globally in response to the market demand on on-line
shopping offers. Returning the favour, the on line merchants are expanding as well, due to the easy
142

Russian Federation.
52

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

and cheap access to the on line shopping settlements provided to the customers by on line payment
services.
193.
Individuals wanting to shop online or to participate in an online auction can use an existing
bank account, credit card, wire transfer, money order, and even cash to fund an account with an online
intermediary that will facilitate the payment. Some online payment services exist to facilitate
transactions for online gambling and adult content sites that other money transmitters typically will not
service.143
194.
Using cyber money into the virtual market-place seems to be a logical aftermath for the
perpetrators. Usually this technique is located at the end of the cyber laundering scheme, in the
integration phase but occurs also at the layering stage, when the purchase is followed by a subsequent
sale.
195.
The on-line auction sites are a favourite tool for buying high value-goods (Russian
Federation), or services flight tickets (Albania). A specific aspect to illegal purchases through the
Internet is related to counterfeit pharmaceutical products and sales of high risk or illegal items - such
as prescription drugs, firearms, suspect child pornography, multi level marketing (pyramid or Ponzi
schemes), escort services, tobacco sales, drug precursors, stolen credit cards and credit card
information. Money transfers performed in relation to such transactions are particularly vulnerable to
money laundering. Also, a particular risk for money laundering is associated with virtual gaming and
payment made in relation to such services providers.
3.1.9

Shell companies

196.
Cases also reveal the use of shell companies in this context. Shell companies offer large
opportunities for cyber money launderers, and appear to be used primarily at the layering stage. Shell
companies are enterprises without any business activity, assets and liability. But such an entity
possesses a number of bank accounts often conveniently located in offshore jurisdictions. Their role is
to offer a reason for the payment for the payer’s bank, and to disguise the money trail.
197.
Generally, the shell companies have only an address, a letterbox and a manager who is the
nominee to deal with the company’s many bank accounts. Shell companies could make use of both the
traditional financial system and the Internet based payment services providers. If transactions are
performed through the banking system, the difficulty in detection of the suspicious activity is, in fact,
detecting the “shell” element in the company. If the transfers are made through the less regulated new
payment services, the shell companies might proceed undetected.
198.
–
–
–

Case studies show that :
Shell companies can and have been used as vehicles for cybercrime schemes and money
laundering.
When shell companies are used in cybercrime and money laundering the amounts transferred
tend to be higher than usual.
The use of shell companies is often related to offshore jurisdictions.

Case study 15: The use of a shell company for international transfer of fraudulent funds
The FIU received an STR based on the AML/CFT Act relating to fraud/fraudulent activity. 1.000.000 USD was
credited into the bank account of an off-shore company holding a bank account in Hungary. The fund transfer came
from a private bank account from another EU country.
143

Regarding this 1.000.000 USD transaction the Hungarian bank received a SWIFT messages from the sender bank
in which the sender bank referred to fraudulent activity and asked the Hungarian bank to freeze the beneficiary’s
accounts and return the sum in question to the sender bank because of a suspected fraud. The beneficiary
appeared to be a shell company.
After the money was received in the Hungarian bank account, a part of the amount was transferred immediately
further on and the rest was withdrawn in cash by the representative of the off-shore company.
Criminal proceedings have begun in both countries, Hungarian law enforcement authorities froze the concerned
bank accounts and AML actions are in place at the moment.

Case study 16: Fraud via POS terminals
A fraud and money laundering case was detected related to foreign natural persons who asked permanent
residence for the purpose of business activities in the country and subsequently established a new company
officially registered in the Company’s Registry. The foreign citizens were registered as owners and statutory bodies
of the company. The scope of business of the company was stated a wholesale of fashion goods. At the same time
these persons opened bank accounts in the name of the company with domestic banks. The bank accounts were
credited by deposits of high amounts of cash money.
The natural persons representing the company also requested the banks to provide them with mobile POS (point of
sale) terminals for the purpose receiving regular incomes from the customers in their business activity.
These persons also opened a number of personal bank accounts with domestic banks and deposited cash in high
amounts, asking the banks to issue payment cards related to these accounts.
As far as the system with POS terminals and pre-authorization operated as it was intended they made use of their
personal payment cards via POS terminals. The company gave orders for realization of transactions based on preauthorizations which had not been debited from the personal accounts but were processed. Immediately after
expiration of pre-authorizations the funds were withdrawn in cash from the personal accounts by these persons.
Then the funds were credited on accounts belonging to the company and immediately withdrawn in cash, deposited
on new personal accounts and transferred abroad. The balance of personal accounts was minus indicating high
debits.
Currently criminal prosecution is conducted for serious crime of fraud and money laundering. This case was special
because of the in-depth preparation of the crime nd investment of own money, properly selected alleged scope of
business, sophisticated modus operandi which required detailed knowledge of the bank system and timing for the
ending of pre –authorization.

Prepaid cards

199.
Prepaid cards are relatively new in the world of consumer electronic payments and they begin
as an electronic form of the paper-gift cards. A wide range of prepaid stored value cards are available
for purchase with minimal or no identity checking. These cards can have funds transferred onto them
and then be either sold or used. Aside from prepaid credit cards, this process can be performed with
store cards and with “pay as you go” mobile phones.
200.
The pre-paid cards bear in their memory the amount previously deposited to the company or
agent that issued them. The so called gift-cards (closed system) allow the holder to buy goods and

54

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

services within an pre determined commercial chain. They can be bought and used anonymously. This
cards can be bought from auction sites (e-bay) at an under-valued price.
201.
The open system pre-paid cards are issued by banks or other credit and financial institutions,
and they can be used for acquisitions at all retailers where usual credit cards are accepted. They can
be used for cash withdrawals and are linked to an on line payment account.
202.
Prepaid cards can be used by criminals to move illicit money from a jurisdiction to another
(layering stage) or to buy products and/or services for the criminal’s benefit (integration stage).
Prepaid cards have been introduced in a number of countries, but in most countries responding to the
survey, their use appears to be less frequent compared with the US144. A Boston Consulting Group
study forecasts that the US will account for 53% of the global prepaid cards, and supports data that
found that Italy was the most advanced prepaid market in Europe, while UK market was described as
“established”, and markets as Germany and Austria were described as “embryonic”. However, the use
and spread of prepaid cards have grown in the recent years. According to the Basel Committee on
Payment and Settlement Services the number of issued cards with an e-money function has grown
from 107,6 million in 2004 to 275,28 million in 2008 in selected countries145.
Case study 17: From phishing to conversion to digital currencies
Transaction numbers were initially "phished" by Trojans. The "phishing transfer" was made to a bank account held
by a financial agent. The financial agent withdrew the money – deducting his commission - in cash. He
subsequently purchased credit vouchers of an Internet payment system at various issuing offices, like petrol
stations, kiosks, for a maximum amount of 500 €.The purchase was anonymous without identification of the buyer.
In this way, real money was converted to virtual money. The financial agent sent the voucher number (which is
called „ready- to-spend PIN code) by e-mail to the person giving instructions. The PIN code was used on the
Internet for payment of goods and services, casino and gambling websites on the Internet. Several vouchers for
smaller amounts could be used jointly and combined. A conversion to other digital currencies by using various
exchangers acting on the Internet was possible. The law enforcement authorities were unable to trace the
transaction channels.

Case study 18: Data theft, money laundering and use of prepaid cards
Apart from mafia-style organisations that are operating within a determined area, a number of ad-hoc criminal
groups join together as some opportunities arise. Some are operating for years, some just for a short period of
time. The TJX company defrauded between 2005 and 2007 the stolen the credit cards numbers of 94 millions of
north-American and British clients. In August 2008, 11 persons were arrested (3 US citizens, 1 Estonians, 2
Chinese, 1 Belarus and 3 Ukrainians [146]. Media reports indicated that they were part of an international pirates
criminal organisation. Among them were those who broke into the wifi network and some top coordinators of the
organisation. They were individuals that constantly met on carding forums created after the “CarderPlanet” model,
welcoming members from all over the world.
Apart from the information related to credit cards, the sellers proposed false documents (passports), travellers’
cheques and even false study licences. In 2009 another incident on 130 millions stolen banking data was revealed.

The authors of this attack were the same individuals involved in the TJX case.
In order to develop a fraudulent scheme such as in the TJX case, criminal groups specialised in use of false credit
cards are required. These criminal groups join together or are dismantles whenever necessary.
In March 2007, Florida Police investigated one of the criminal group member and made several arrests. The scheme
was based on the use on pre-paid cards (gift cards) used in electronic and jewels stores for high value acquisitions.
The pre-paid cards were bought with counterfeit credit cards supplied by another member of the gang. This
technique allowed them to launder more than 225.000 USD.

147

The trade with stolen banking data is high profit rate. Then users take supplementary risks, but the profits are also
high. For the last ones, two methods are at hand: buying from the Internet from sites that require only the billing
or the delivery address, or using counterfeit cards in countries where the magnetic band is still in use.

Online gaming and online trading platforms

203.
Although the survey results did not identify specific cases of involving online gaming
platforms or internet trading platforms for foreign exchange and other financial markets, several
countries have also raised the issue of opportunities for money laundering in this context.
204.
Such platforms are also the vulnerable to cybercrime attacks or fraud aimed primarily at
customers’ funds appropriation and present specific ML/TF vulnerabilities, which have been analysed in
other typologies specific surveys.148
205.
The software provided by online games’ organisers allows to move and accumulate large
amounts of funds, depositing and prize money withdrawing being possible by bank transfers or various
electronic payment systems. A trend towards the organised use of bookmaker houses with registered
gaming sites was noted (Bulgaria), whereby such platforms were used for money laundering,
concealment of assets and tax evasion, with assets mainly used for financing criminal groups, opening
of new gambling places, corruption and other offences.

Indicators of potential money laundering activity: money laundering
red flags/ indicators

206.
As regards cyber laundering, red flags of anomalous behaviour can be similar to the
indicators in the traditional payment systems, or sometimes might bear some particular features.
Occurrence of one or more of these indicators may be a warning sign of unusual activity that may be
linked to money laundering or terrorist financing. While not all inclusive, this list does reflect ways
that launderers have been known to operate, based on the responses to the survey. Transactions or
activities listed here may not necessarily be indicative of money laundering if they are consistent with
customer’s legitimate business. Reporting entities should focus on identifying suspicious activity rather

COUNTERMEASURES

207.
In response to increasing criminal money flows on the Internet, public and private sector
organisations have adopted a range of measures, as the examples in this chapter show.
208.
These measures may serve as good practices and could become elements of more systematic
future approaches and strategies that are aimed at the prevention of money laundering and the
financing of terrorism, and at the search, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime on the
Internet:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

Mechanisms for reporting on fraud and other proceeds generating offences on the Internet;
Prevention and public awareness;
Regulation, risk management and due diligence;
Creation of a legal framework based on international standards;
Establishment of specialised units for high-tech crime;
Interagency co-operation, in particular between authorities responsible for financial
investigations, money laundering and cybercrime;
Public-private co-operation and information exchange;
Training.

209.
Before summarising good practices and measures taken, it is useful to provide an overview of
the many public and private sector institutions that have a stake, hold important information and
therefore should be involved:

regard to net neutrality and non-discrimination, content filtering, freedom of speech, profiling, privacy and
protection of personal data.

210.
Limited data and knowledge of fraud and other types of cybercrime is considered a key
obstacle to preventing and controlling cybercrime and criminal money flows as pointed out by
countries in their replies to the questionnaire: capabilities to analyse Internet fraud and related money
flows are missing in most countries. Awareness and understanding that organised criminal structures
may be behind what appears to be instances of minor fraud among is limited. While suspicious money

Such private sector initiatives follow billions of sets of data traffic per day to identify malicious activities and thus

dispose of huge amounts of data that appear to be largely untapped by law enforcement.

For a list of initiatives see:
http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/co-operation/economiccrime/cybercrime/Documents/networks/Networks_en.asp
Examples of initiatives focusing on fraud are:
–

the Anti-Phishing Working Group (http://www.antiphishing.org/), a global pan-industrial and law enforcement
association focused on eliminating fraud and identity theft resulting from phishing, pharming and email spoofing
of all types

–

The London Action Plan (http://www.antiphishing.org/) which is to promote international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination
of viruses. The participants also open the Action Plan for participation by other interested government and public
agencies, and by appropriate private sector representatives, as a way to expand the network of entities engaged
in spam enforcement co-operation

–

The Messaging Anti-abuse Working Group (http://www.maawg.org/) (MAAWG) that is to bring the messaging
industry together to work collaboratively and to successfully address the various forms of messaging abuse,
such as spam, viruses, denial-of-service attacks and other messaging exploitations.

flows are detected, law enforcement and private industry are often not able to collate the data, that is,
“to connect the dots” to obtain the full picture of criminal operations and to detect patterns.
211.

Examples of good practice related to Internet crime reporting are available or in the making.

4.1.1

Internet Crime Complaint Centre (IC3)15

212.
The IC3 was created as a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the
National White Collar Crime Center. It accepts complaints online from persons who believe they were
defrauded or from a third party to the complainant, and it refers complaints to law enforcement
authorities for further investigation. According to its mission statement:
IC3's mission is to serve as a vehicle to receive, develop, and refer criminal complaints regarding the
rapidly expanding arena of cyber crime. The IC3 gives the victims of cyber crime a convenient and easyto-use reporting mechanism that alerts authorities of suspected criminal or civil violations. For law
enforcement and regulatory agencies at the federal, state, local, and international level, IC3 provides a
central referral mechanism for complaints involving Internet related crimes.

213.
In 2009, the IC3 received 336,655 complaint submissions, of which 146,663 were referred to
law enforcement.16 Most of these referrals were complaints related to the non-delivery of goods and
services (19.9%), identity theft (14.1%), debit/credit card fraud (10.4%) and auction fraud 10.3%).
214.
The new classification introduced in 2009 comprises 79 complaint types that go beyond fraud
and also cover drug trafficking, intimidation, pornography, terrorism and a range of other offences
involving the Internet.17
215.
The complaint reporting allows law enforcement to detect not only individual offences but to
identify trends and to analyse Internet-related crime in a more comprehensive manner.
216.
The IC3 publishes annual Internet Crime Reports, as well as awareness and educational
materials aimed at preventing fraud and other forms of Internet crime.

4.1.2

MELANI18

217.
In Switzerland, the “Melde- und Analysestelle Informationssicherung” (MELANI) was
established in 2004. It is a centre for reporting and analysis related to the security of information
systems that provides information on threats and countermeasures, analytical situation reports on
threats and trends and the possibility to report incidents.
218.
MELANI is maintained by GovCERT.CH, the Federal Intelligence Service (NDB) and the
Federal Strategy Unit for Information Technology (ISB).
219.
As of 1 January 2010, MELANI has the authority to block, under certain conditions, domain
names that are suspected of identity theft (phishing) or spreading of malware.

4.1.3

National Fraud Reporting Centre19

220.
The United Kingdom, in 2010, established “Action Fraud” as the national fraud reporting
centre to provide a central point of information on fraud and allows 24/7 online fraud reporting.
221.
Action Fraud is managed by the National Fraud Authority which is an executive agency of the
Attorney General’s Office. Partners include the City of London Police, National Fraud Intelligence
Bureau (NFIB), the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office. Cases reported are
registered and referred to the NFIB for investigation or intelligence purposes. Action Fraud,
furthermore, provides preventive information, including fraud warnings, and support to victims.
4.1.4

Internet Crime Reporting Online System (I-CROS)20

222.
The establishment of I-CROS at Europol was initiated in 2010 with the support of the
European Commission. It will allow European Union member States and eventually third parties to
submit offences noted on the Internet to EUROPOL. The focus will be on offences as defined in articles
2 to 8 of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. 21
223.
I-CROS is the European level of the so-called European Alert Platform for reporting offences
noted on the Internet, as approved by the Council of the EU in its Conclusions on setting up national
alert platforms and a European alert platform for reporting offences noted on the Internet (24 October
2008). It complements national alert platforms being set-up in the member States. Reports made by
citizens and businesses are received first by national platforms, who process them, and then forward
those reports of relevance to other member States and Europol for cross-checking within I-CROS.
224.
I-CROS is part of European Cybercrime Platform (ECCP) that includes also the Analysis Work
File “Cyborg” that is focusing on criminal groups operating on the Internet, and the Internet & Forensic
Expert Forum (IFOREX) to host technical data and training for cybercrime law enforcement. ECCP is a
first step towards a more consistent and effective approach to fighting Internet criminality at the EU
level.
4.1.5

Signal Spam22

225.
Signal Spam is a public-private partnership in France that allows Internet users to report
spam messages which are recorded in a single database that is then used for criminal and
administrative investigations, as well as research, and that allows to enhance network security and
email delivery.
226.
Members include associations (such as the French ISP association AFA, the French
Advertising Union, Business Software Alliance and others), industry (such as CERT-LEXI, eBay/PayPal,
Microsoft, Orange and others) and national authorities (Gendamerie Nationale, French Police High-tech
Crime Unit, the French Data Protection Authority CNIL, the Investigation Brigade o Fraud and
Information Technology and others).

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

4.1.6

E-Crime reporting: using a common data format

227.
Data relevant to cybercrime investigations is often voluminous, scattered across different
jurisdictions and venues, and archived in disparate file formats that obstruct machine- based sharing
and processing.
228.
In order to overcome this problem, the Anti-Phishing Working Group developed an XML-based
scheme for reporting technical aspects of phishing, fraud and other forms of electronic crime.
229.
The APWG defined a set of extensions to the Incident Object Description Exchange Format
(IODEF), a reporting standard for network events adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF).23 This will enable a common reporting format and provide data on the fraud source and target
of the attack, the web servers involved, the malware used, domain name service and registry
information, evidentiary files, and others.
230.
As a common reporting format it will thus facilitate data sharing between public and private
sector institutions and may permit more automated mechanisms for e-crime detection in the future.

4.2

Prevention and public awareness

231.
Public education and awareness and other measures obviously are essential elements to
prevent fraud and other forms of crime, and thus money laundering and criminal money flows on the
Internet.
232.
The offer in this respect is increasing, ranging from public website with general fraud
prevention information,24 or materials and educational materials and courses,25 to recommendations
for employees of public or private sector organisations or specific resources to prevent risks in a
specific sector,26 or assistance to victims of fraud.27
233.
An example, combining reporting on botnet activity, informing users that their systems are
infected, providing assistance in the cleaning of user systems and preventive measures is the Antibotnet Advisory Centre www.botfrei.de which is a public-private initiative of the German Federal Office
for Information Security and the service provider association ECO. The offer is available in several
languages.

4.3

Regulatory and supervisory measures

4.3.1

Risk management and due diligence measures

234.
Financial institutions should design and implement appropriate measures and controls to
mitigate the potential money laundering risks in respect of the relevant products, services or

customers, based on a thorough risk assessment process. Such measures and controls may require
investments both in terms of resources and time in order to identify and capture appropriate risk data.
Such measures and controls may include one or more of the following:
increased awareness by the institution of higher risk situations determined by types of
financial services and/or products and/or customers;
appropriate levels of know your customer (“KYC”) or enhanced due diligence;
escalation for approval of the establishment of an account or relationship;
record-keeping;
increased monitoring of transactions ; and
increased levels of ongoing controls and reviews of relationships.

235.
While guidance has been provided on risk based approaches for managing money laundering
risks28 in general, specific guidance on Internet-related risks is being developed for financial
organisations offering services on the Internet.
236.
One example is Recommendation No. 1 of 2009 (10 February) of the Board of the Hungarian
Financial Supervisory Authority on Internet security risks.29
237.

The financial sector has measures in place to manage risks such as:

–

Centralised transaction databases that can be used to correlate transactions, perform
analysis, identify suspicious transactions, create red flags and rapidly detect criminal activity
both within a financial institution and between financial institutions;
Behaviour profiling and monitoring for mule account activity in financial institutions;
“Hot lists” of known or suspected accounts;
Information sharing between financial institutions;
Adopting a holistic view of all money movement within a particular financial institution;
Implementation of protective measures in online banking services, including two factor
authentication, TAN (Transaction Authorisation Number) and MTAN (mobile TAN);
verification of documentation or requirements for additional documents to confirm customer
identity;
requiring first payment transaction to be carried out between domestic accounts or other preapproved countries;
monitoring and analysis of statements of transactions using bank cards;
limiting the amounts of funds that can be transferred using bank cards;
analysing and seeking links from a bank card to specific bank accounts from which card value
has been transferred or to which card value has been transferred;
monitoring card transactions and recording suspicious activities;
denying anonymous, encoded or numbered accounts via electronic systems or Internet as
well as those accounts offered by offshore banks in Internet banking.

models and software to detect unusual and suspicious activities based on red flags and indicators,
manual review of suspicious transactions, delaying of transactions, maintaining of audit trails. 30
239.
Specific measures adopted by the payment card industry include the implementation of
security standards by merchants, processors and financial institutions31 or risk management guides for
merchants.32
4.3.2

Due diligence for registrars and registries

240.
The use of domains for criminal purposes, such as botnet operations, is a building block of
the infrastructure for cybercrime. The process of domain registration33 offers an opportunity to prevent
and disrupt the risk of misuse of domains by criminals.
241.
A set of due diligence recommendations was therefore drafted in 2009 by law enforcement
agencies for adoption by ICANN.34
242.

They foresee that:

–
–

ICANN performs due diligence investigations on all registrars and registries;
ICANN amends the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) to ensure that registrars collect
accurate and complete data of those registering domain names;
WHOIS information of all generic Top Level Domains (gTLD) is accurate and detailed and can
be provided to law enforcement;

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Harmonised legal framework based on international standards

4.4

245.
The creation of a legal framework for the criminalization of conduct related to criminal money
flows on the Internet, for the effective investigation of cybercrime, money laundering and the financing
of terrorism, for financial investigations and the confiscation of crime proceeds and for international cooperation is considered essential. The Budapest Convention and the Warsaw Conventions help
countries meet this challenge.
4.4.1

Implementation of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime

246.
Several countries pointed at the implementation of Budapest Convention on Cybercrime as an
important measure to enable criminal justice responses:
–

Adoption of substantive criminal law provisions in line with articles 2 to 12 means the
criminalisation of the different acts involved when fraud and other offences are committed on
the Internet. Of particular relevance are article 2 (illegal access), article 3 (illegal
interception), article 4 (data interference), article 5 (system interference), article 7
(computer-related forgery) and article 8 (computer-related fraud).

–

Implementation of the procedural law provisions (such as articles 16 and 17 on expedited
preservation, article 18 on production orders, article 19 on search and seizure and articles 20
and 21 on the interception of traffic and content data) permit law enforcement to seize
volatile electronic evidence in an efficient manner. They also stipulate the co-operation of
Internet service providers in criminal investigations.

–

Parties to the Convention can make use of this treaty as a framework for international cooperation, including the expedited preservation of data in other jurisdictions (article 29) and
efficient mutual legal assistance in accessing computer data (article 31).

–

The Budapest Convention helps ensure harmonisation of legislation between countries which
in itself is an important prerequisite for international co-operation. A large number of
countries around the world is using this treaty as a guideline for developing domestic
legislation.

247.
Examples of countries that recently adopted or updated legislation include Estonia, Germany
and Portugal. The example of Romania is useful in that it closely follows the Budapest Convention on
Cybercrime. 38
4.4.2

Implementation of the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation
of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism39

248.
The Warsaw Convention of 2005 sets out requirements for State Parties to adopt a number of
measures, including:

Changes are to be reflected in amendments to the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), and subsequent
enforcement. Further discussions are to be held at ICANN 43 in Costa Rica in March 2012.

249.
An adequate implementation of this treaty’s provisions should enable public authorities to
take effective measures to search, seize and confiscate crime proceeds, to prevent and control money
laundering and the financing of terrorism and to cooperate internationally with each other.
250.
This Convention provides for a monitoring mechanism through a Conference of the Parties to
ensure that its provisions are being effectively implemented. 40

4.5

Establishment of specialised units for high-tech crime41

251.

Many countries have established specialised units for cybercrime. Examples include42:

–

Albania: The State Police under the Financial Crime Investigation Department has two
specialized structures of which one is responsible for the investigation of computer crimes
(Cyber Crime Investigations Sector), and one for the investigation of criminal assets.

–

Belarus: Department for Financial Monitoring of the State Control Committee (DFM) and Units
for high-tech crime under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Security Committee
have been established.

–

China: A special department (Cybersecurity Bureau) to counter cybercrime has been
established in the Ministry of Public Security. The China Anti-Money Laundering and
Monitoring Centre monitors criminal money flows, including on the Internet.

–

Hungary: Establishment of a Cybercrime Unit of National Bureau of Investigation of
Hungarian Police, and Financial Forensic Department of HFSA and Establishment of national
cyber incident management capacity –CERT-Hungary.

–

Romania: A service for countering cyber criminality has been created within the Organised
Crime and Terrorism Investigation Directorate at the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the High
Court of Cassation and Justice. The functions of this unit have been defined in line with Law
no.161/2003. A special cybercrime unit has been operating at General Inspectorate of the
Romanian police (organized crime Directorate of the Police) since 2003.

Presidium of the Police Force of the Slovak Republic deals with methodology, trends and
cases related to cybercrime at the national level in the Slovak Republic.

–

“The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia”: the department of cybercrime and
counterfeiting was established in January 2005, as part of the Sector of Organised Crime.
Since 2008, this Department is now a special unit for fighting cybercrime, as a part of the
Department of Organised Crime.

–

Ukraine: in 2001 a specialised department on the fight against offences in intellectual
property and computer systems was established at the Ministry of Interior. Appropriate
departments of the Security Service of Ukraine are also responsible for the fight against
cybercrime, in particular, units for counter-espionage at the State Economy Protection
Department; units of Senior Department on combat against corruption and organized crime
of Security Service of Ukraine counteract to illicit proceeds flows through Internet/computer
systems.

252.

Police-type high-tech crime units typically have the following tasks:43

–

Cybercrime investigation
perform investigations for combating cybercrime;
collect and analyse data and information;
carry out technical activities for researching computer systems;
draft internal rules and procedures for cybercrime investigation;
assist other police departments in performing investigations;
perform activities for international judicial assistance for criminal issues, within national
and international mutual assistance;
conduct public awareness cybercrime prevention activities.

–

Research
conduct quality research activities into cybercrime trends both domestically and
internationally to inform the future requirements for countering cybercrime;
work with academic and industry partners to develop tools and techniques to assist in
the efforts to combat cybercrime.

–

Intelligence gathering
perform activities for international co-operation and information exchange with other
similar bodies from abroad;
perform analyses, studies, and evaluation of the criminal phenomenon;
gathering both open source and covert Internet intelligence.

–

Training
establish a professional training programme for digital forensic specialist and
cybercrime investigators to ensure that the correct level of knowledge and skills are
available.

In 2010, the European Union established the EU Cyber Crime Task Force which comprises the
heads of cybercrime or high-tech crime units of the EU. In 2011, this Task Force and the Council of
Europe cooperated in the preparation of a good practice study on specialised cybercrime units. 44

4.6

Inter-agency co-operation

254.
Cooperation between authorities responsible for financial investigations and confiscation of
proceeds, measures again money laundering and cybercrime is considered an important condition for
success against criminal money on the Internet. The replies to the questionnaire provide some
examples.
4.6.1

Germany: Project group “Electronic payment systems”

255.
The German Federal Criminal Police (BKA) has established a project group on “electronic
payment systems” led by the financial intelligence unit of the BKA with the participation of five State
Criminal Police Offices (LKAs). It comprised experts in financial investigations, Internet and computer
crime and confiscation of assets as well as experts from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(BAFIN). The tasks of the group were to:

–
–

identify and analyse representative cases involving electronic payment systems by carrying
out checks with the national police authorities;
describe problem areas from the police point of view;
describe enforcement approaches from the view of the police and the supervisory authority.

256.

The project group issued the following recommendations for action:

–

A newsletter on the general functioning of electronic payment systems is to raise the
awareness of all police offices in Germany.
This topic is to be dealt with in the training of police officers from the fields of financial
investigations, Internet and computer crime and confiscation of assets.
The FIU will also publish a Newsletter on these problems and make it available on its website.
Close co-operation with the online payment providers is also important, especially having
points of contact.
The co-operation between the police and the supervisory authorities will have to be
intensified as well; similar to the already existing co-operation between BAFIN and the
BKA/FIU.
The information exchange between supervisory authorities at the international level is
important so that, for example, coordinated prohibition orders can be issued against online
payment providers not holding an authorisation.
Finally, the international supervision of providers should be coordinated and intensified. This
is not a problem that can be solved at national level.
This topic should be dealt with in an appropriate, intensified and coordinated manner by
international bodies, such as the FATF.

–

–
–
–
–

257.
The BKA furthermore began to set up an information pool on electronic payment systems that
can be accessed by all police officers at the national level. However, the setting up and maintenance of
such a database at international level was considered to be more efficient.

Public-private co-operation and information exchange

259.
Public-private co-operation and information exchange is arguably the measure with the
strongest impact on the prevention and control of criminal money flows on the Internet. It addresses a
key problem, namely the limited sharing and use of existing information between domestic financial
institutions, and between financial institutions and law enforcement.
260.
It is therefore no coincidence that many examples have been provided in the replies to the
questionnaire and other sources. Most of these examples related to co-operation and information
exchange at domestic levels. Enhanced public-private co-operation and information exchange at the
international level was considered desirable.
261.
Further public-private co-operation could help address a major problem of all forms of
cybercrime, that is, to attribute criminal conduct to a person.
4.7.1

The Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) High Tech Crime Forum

262.
The Forum consists of Senior staff in information security, fraud and risk management
functions from all of the retail banks operating in Ireland that offer an online banking service:
–
–
–
–
–

An Garda Siochana.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Payment Services Organisation.
The Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland.
The University College Dublin Centre for Cybercrime Investigation (UCD CCI).

263.
The High Tech Crime Forum meets bi-monthly to exchange information on recent and
emerging threats and to formulate a coordinated approach to high tech crime threats against online
banks operating in Ireland.
264.
One of the key successes of the Forum has been an effort, working in conjunction with an
Garda Siochana and UCD CCI, to identify threats to banking and payment services occurring in other
jurisdictions in order to be able to assess the potential threats posed by emerging attacks and
proactively defend against these attacks before any losses are incurred by the banks operating in
Ireland. Periodic reports on emerging attacks are delivered to the high tech crime forum.
265.
The key achievement of the Forum is to develop confidence between the members so that
they can share information freely in a trusted environment. Members of such a Forum must also be
convinced that the issues of cybercrime prevention, detection and response are not issues of
competition.

73

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

266.
Further, there should be a general understanding that even though a particular member of
the Forum is under attack at a given time, it could just as easily be any of the other members at any
time in the future.
267.
Another aspect of best practice implemented by the IBF High Tech Crime Forum is proactive
action against emerging cybercrime threats. UCD CCI carries out research on behalf of the Forum. The
members of the Forum identify key areas of concern, priorities for research are set by law
enforcement, and UCD CCI carries out the research. This process, consisting of:
engaging with all members of the high tech crime forum;
receiving advice and direction from law enforcement;
leveraging the expertise of the UCD CCI;
leads to a significant volume of valuable research being carried out in Ireland.

–
–
–
–

268.
The main focus of research carried out to date by UCD CCI for the Forum has consisted of
identifying threats emerging in other countries before they are seen in Ireland so that the Irish banks
can assess their risk and take appropriate preventative measures before any losses are suffered.
269.
The UCD CCI also attempts to examine the industry response to various new threats that
have been seen in recent months in order to identify areas where a greater level of co-operation
between the members would be beneficial.
4.7.2

Hungary: Incident management working group

270.
In Hungary, an Internet security/incident watch and management working group has been
established with the participation of banks, law enforcement (National Bureau of Investigation), the
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-Hungary45) and the Hungarian Financial Supervisory
Authority (HFSA).46 At least four times per year the situation is analysed and new methods of
perpetration are reviewed in view of preventive measures. Once per year, a practical exercise is
carried out in which an attack is simulated and incident response capabilities are strengthened.
271.
A professional protocol to react to phishing attacks (in case of attack: who to contact at police
and financial institution, how to cooperate, type and structure of data to be exchanged etc.) is being
developed with the participation of the police and experts from credit institutions to enable immediate
and efficient responses.
4.7.3

US National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance - NCFTA47

272.
The core mission of the NCFTA – created in 1997 – is to identify criminals responsible for
cyber-based attacks. It provides a conduit for intelligence exchange between industry and law
enforcement, including small and medium enterprises.
273.

Specific initiatives include:

–
–

CyFin – a forum against online stock manipulation schemes;
Reshipping – an initiative against the concealment of the true recipients of merchandise
purchased with stolen payment credentials;
Digital Phishnet – developing intelligence of high-priority and sophisticated phishing schemes;

Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISAC) for the financial sector

274.
In the USA, the “Financial Services – Information Sharing and Analysis Center” (FS-ISAC)48 is
a US industry forum for co-operation on critical (physical and cyber) security threats to the financial
sector. It collects and analyses information and alerts member organisations of threats and attacks in
order to help the financial services sector to prepare and respond to threats. In this, the FS-ISAC
cooperates with the US Department of Treasury and is the “operational arm” of the Financial Services
Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC).
275.
It was established in 1999 in response to a US Presidential Directive mandating “that the
public and private sectors share information about physical and cyber security threats and
vulnerabilities to help protect the U.S. critical infrastructure”.
276.

Examples of advisories include:

–
–
–

Fraud advisory for business: corporate account take over (October 2010)49;
Fraud advisory for consumers: involvement in criminal activity through work from home
scams (October 2010)50;
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks: an overview and analysis (June 2010)51.

277.

Similar “ISACs” have been established in other countries.52

278.
For example, in the Netherlands, an ISAC-style “Cybercrime Information Exchange” was
established in 2006 as part of the National Infrastructure against Cybercrime (NICC) which is a publicprivate partnership.53 The first to join the information exchange was the financial sector (FI-ISAC).54 It
provides a platform for the exchange of information between the National Police Services Agency
(KLPD), the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD), the Government Computer Emergency
Response Team (GOVERT.NL), banks and the Netherlands bankers’ association with the NICC as a
facilitator. About eight meetings are held per year. It involves exchanging information during
meetings, notice and take down measures and the monitoring if threats.
279.

The creation of a European-level FI-ISAC has been under discussion since 2008.55

The European Financial Coalition was established in 2009 as a partnership of financial,
Internet and technology corporations with police agencies to “track, disrupt and to ultimately
confiscate commercial gain made” by those distributing child abuse materials. The 14-months pilot
phase was funded with the support of the European Union.
281.

Five working groups have been established:

–

Law enforcement co-operation working group;

4.7.6

Electronic Crimes Task Forces (US Secret Service)59

283.
From October 2001, a network of Electronic Crime Task Forces as well as Working Groups
were established in the USA at federal, state and local levels to prevent, mitigate and investigate
attacks on financial and critical infrastructure. They bring together law enforcement, prosecutors,
private industry and academia.
284.

Investigations focus on priority cases meeting the following criteria:

–
–
–

Significant economic or community impact;
Participation of organized criminal groups involving multiple districts or transnational
organisations;
Use of schemes involving new technology.

4.7.7

The European Electronic Crime Task Force (EECTF)60

The EECTF was created in June 2009 as a result of an agreement between the Italian Post, the Italian
Police and the US Secret Service. It defines its mission as follows:

This group is co-chaired by VISA Europe and MasterCard and includes representatives from a number of key
payment processing organisations. This working group is responsible for identifying best practice within the financial
industry across Europe, ensuring that policies and procedures are in place to prevent organisers from utilising the
payment systems. The group are also looking to identify how to improve relations and information exchange
between the financial industry and law enforcement.

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

“Support the analysis and the development of best practices against Cyber Crime in European
countries through the creation of a strategic alliance between law enforcement, academia,
legal, and private sector entities “
A number of European law enforcement authorities, financial sector and Internet security institutions
as well as academic institutions joined this task force in the meantime. It meets quarterly and offers a
trusted community to share information and identify solutions.
4.7.8

Contact Initiative against Cybercrime for Industry and Law Enforcement (CICILE)61

285.
CICILE is a secure web-based communication platform that has been set up by the European
Commission to facilitate the exchange and dissemination of information concerning the prevention of
and the fight against cybercrime between stakeholders, such as law enforcement, government
agencies, the private sector and NGOs. While this community is hosted by the European Commission,
it is managed by its members.
286.
CICILE is based on the existing platform SYNAPSE. SINAPSE is a web communication
platform offering tools to promote a better use of expertise in EU policy making and governance
(networking of advisory bodies, support to expert groups, ad-hoc/public consultations and e-debates,
etc.). SINAPSE is a free public service of the European Commission. SINAPSE in particular allows the
creation of "e-Communities" which enables groups of members and organisations with a common
interest to share and exchange information in a dedicated environment which can be graphically
personalised and linked to the initiator website.

4.7.9

Guidelines for law enforcement/ISP co-operation in the investigation of cybercrime

287.
Cooperation between law enforcement authorities and Internet service providers is of crucial
importance in the investigation of cybercrime
288.
In 2008, the Octopus Conference organised by the Council of Europe under the Global Project
on Cybercrime adopted guidelines62 to help law enforcement and ISPs structure their co-operation.
They:
include common guidelines for both law enforcement and service providers and specific
guidelines for each of them;
are not to substitute legislation or other formal regulations, but rather to supplement and
help regulations work in practice;
are based on good practices already available;
are to be adapted to the specific circumstances in each country.

–
–
–
–

289.
In practical terms, representatives of law enforcement and service providers in a given
country may establish a working group with the aim of reaching an understanding or even a formal
agreement on how to cooperate with each other. The guidelines could serve as a blue-print or simply
as a basis for discussion.
290.

Following the adoption of these guidelines in April 2008:

The European Court of Human Rights referred to them and specifically to the need for a
“culture of co-operation” between law enforcement and ISPs in its judgment K.U. v. Finland
(application no. 2872/02)63.
the European Union's Justice and Home Affairs Council in November 200864 recommended
that the European Commission work on the basis of the guidelines adopted by the Council of
Europe conference and took note of eight specific recommendations.
the Government of Romania decided in January 2009 that judicial, law enforcement and
regulatory bodies should make use of these guidelines. They were posted on the websites of
the Ministry of Justice, the Office the Prosecutor General, the Ministry of Interior and other
bodies.
the Ministry of Interior of France and the French Internet service provider association AFA
drafted an agreement based on the guidelines in Ukraine a working group was established in
July 2009 to reach an agreement between law enforcement and service providers.
in India the guidelines were presented to law enforcement and industry (March 2009) in view
of the amendments to the Information Technology Act adopted by Parliament in December
2008 (see presentation).
In Georgia, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Ministry of Interior and
ISPs in May 2010.

University College Dublin (Centre for Cybercrime Investigations) continues to accredit the
training and education programme that is run under the auspices of ECTEG.
4.8.2

The University College Dublin Centre for Cybercrime Investigation (UCD CCI)

293.
UCD has been involved in efforts to harmonise law enforcement cybercrime training since
2001. The CCI was formally established in 2006 with the stated aims of:
–

–

–
–

Developing, delivering and maintaining accredited cybercrime education programmes for
cybercrime investigators/security specialists charged with the prevention and investigation of
high tech crime.
Carrying out applied and theoretical research into cybercrime and publish the results for the
benefit of cybercrime investigators/security specialists in the prevention and detection of high
tech crime.
Developing, validating and maintaining software tools for use by cybercrime
investigators/security specialists in the prevention and fight against high tech crime.
Working in partnership with other stakeholders in the area of cybercrime prevention and
detection.

294.
The CCI has had success by engaging with law enforcement and industry stakeholders both
nationally and internationally.
295.
One tangible result has been the law enforcement only MSc in Forensic Computing and
Cybercrime Investigation provided by UCD CCI. To date, over 110 students have completed, or are
currently enrolled in, this course. Students are from Ireland, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Greece,
Spain, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Romania, Denmark and Cyprus. From outside Europe there are
students from Ghana, United Arab Emirates, China, Japan, USA, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and
Hong Kong. As well as being the culmination of almost 15 years of efforts to harmonise cybercrime
training for law enforcement, one of the key advantages of this type of programme is the community
of alumni that have developed and the fact that knowing law enforcement officers in other jurisdictions
facilitates international co-operation.
296.
It is believed that law enforcement authorities of each country should have a minimum level
of capability to react to cybercrime. Training and education programmes for police are a precondition.

Council of Europe training concept for judges and prosecutors

298.
One of the lessons learned from strategies against money laundering and the financing of
terrorism is the need for the training of judges. Based on the assumption that particular efforts are
required to enable judges and prosecutors to prosecute and adjudicate cybercrime and make use of
electronic evidence through training, networking and specialisation, the Council of Europe – under the

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Global Project on Cybercrime and the Lisbon Network of judicial training institutions – in 2009 adopted
a “concept for cybercrime training for judges and prosecutors”.67
299.
Its purpose is to help judicial training institutions develop training programmes on cybercrime
and electronic evidence for judges and prosecutors and to integrate such training in regular initial and
in-service training. The elements of the concept include:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

Institutionalising initial training;
Institutionalising in-service training;
Standardised and replicable courses/modules;
Access to training/self-training materials;
Pilot centres for basic and advanced training;
Enhancing knowledge through networking;
Public private co-operation.

300.
Implementation of this concept is now underway, for example, in South-eastern Europe with
support of the CyberCrime@IPA project.68

FINDINGS

301.
While cybercrime appears to be a widespread and growing threat generating large amounts
of criminal proceeds, the survey responses and information available reveal that data on related
money laundering and evidence of successful law enforcement action are weak. Cyber-laundering
continues to represent a challenge for law enforcement agencies. These findings are aimed at assisting
policy makers and regulators to identify issues which could be addressed through legislation,
supervision and effective rules and guidance for implementation. They are also aimed at financial
intelligence units and law enforcement agencies, to contribute to a more efficient analysis, detection
and investigation of possible money laundering cases related to cybercrime. They are furthermore to
encourage public-private cooperation and measures by the private sector.

5.1

Cybercrime and criminal money flows

302.
Cybercrime can be conceptualised as comprising (a) offences against computer systems and
data, and (b) offences by means of computer systems and data – including computer-related fraud –
as defined in the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.
303.
The underlying tools and infrastructure of cybercrime encompass malware, botnets, the
criminal misuse of domains, an underground economy providing criminal goods and services, and in
particular money mules that form an essential part in the movement of crime proceeds and in money
laundering on the Internet. Social networks and cloud computing services offer new platforms for
cybercrime and pose new challenges for law enforcement. Complex fraud operations and this
infrastructure show the features of structured organised crime groups.
304.
It would seem that obtaining economic benefits is the primary purpose of cybercrime, and
that large amounts of criminal money circulate on the Internet. Fraud is the most often reported
category of cybercrime by far. It includes, in particular, fraud committed with stolen identities (using
phishing and other social engineering techniques for the theft of information), payment card fraud,
online banking attacks and account take-over, mass-marketing fraud, auction and other types of
confidence fraud, investment fraud as well as pyramid and other multi-level marketing schemes. In
addition to fraud, commercial child abuse materials, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, offences related to
intellectual property rights, online dating schemes, illegal online gambling, extortion and other physical
world crimes proliferate on the Internet and generate proceeds that are moved and laundered.
305.
In can be expected that as societies rely even further on global communication technologies
and networks, all forms of crime – in particular crime for profit – will be increasingly transnational and
involve such technologies and electronic evidence in one way or the other, and so will criminal money
flows and money laundering on the Internet. Societies (public and private sector institutions) need to
prepare for this.

5.2

Money laundering and cybercrime issues

306.
As regards cybercrime and money laundering, the key findings can be summarized as
follows:
–

The financial impact of cybercrime and the size of related proceeds (which are laundered or
re-invested in developing new capabilities for further developing tools and techniques for
cybercrime purposes) are not quantifiable, in the absence of reliable data and research.

Cases show that proceeds from cybercrime are laundered through sophisticated schemes,
involving both traditional (wire transfers, cash withdrawals, money remitting services) and
new payment methods (e-currency, Internet payment services).
As Internet payment services inevitably use at least one element from the traditional financial
system (cash, banks, credit cards…), cybercrime and cyber laundering also affect the
traditional financial system. However, criminals have found ways to move value or monetize
stolen goods without having to use the financial system.
Internet money services providers, together with the “traditional” banking system are used
both for cyber fraud and money laundering. Money remitting services or Internet payment
services providers have been targets and/or victims of cyber-attacks, but also, their services
have been used for money laundering purposes. Some Internet based payment methods are
more vulnerable to money laundering than others.
Cybercriminals prefer to transfer values between persons in different countries by bits and
bytes of information rather than in the form of banknotes. Cash smuggling is reportedly
rarely (next to never) used or might have remained undetected by existing controls. Money
mules appear to be mostly used for “breaking the chain” rather than for cross-border
movement of cash.
Evidence reveals that unlike “traditional” criminal groups that are quite “stable” and have a
well determined organisational chart, cyber criminal groups appear to be extremely flexible.
Ad hoc criminal groups and networks or short term alliances are put together regardless of
the location or profile of the perpetrators. The services provided by the underground
economy reduce the need for sophisticated technical know-how of criminals.
The awareness of risks related to new payment systems and services and of related money
laundering appears to be at a relatively low level in the majority of countries having
responded to the survey.
The most targeted services and sectors by financially motivated cyber-attacks appear to be
payment services and financial institutions, and these are likely to continue being the focus,
considering the increasing reliance by businesses and individuals on online systems in daily
life.
It appears that there is a clear risk of undetected or low report rate of cybercrime offences in
most countries having responded to the survey, which could be due either to a lack of
awareness or to reputational considerations, and this has a direct impact on the absence of
related financial investigations/ money laundering investigations.
Lack of relevant substantive provisions criminalising adequately cybercrime offences69 may
result in excluding certain proceeds-generating types of cybercrime from qualifying as
predicate offences for money laundering.
Though AML/CFT policies constitute an important element of policy approaches to tackling
criminal money flows, national anti-money laundering policies may be disconnected from
anti-cybercrime policies, thus compartmentalising national efforts to prevent and combat
cyber-laundering.
Investigation and prosecution of crimes involving money laundering and cybercrime are likely
to be complex and lengthy. Considering the large number of potential accessories to such
crimes, the difficulties in collating a multitude of “small” cases to reveal large-scale criminal
networks, challenges in obtaining electronic evidence cross-border and considering that many
institutions/agencies may have jurisdiction, there are many deterrents to financial
investigations. This may in some countries privilege investigations focusing on cybercrime
only while neglecting financial and money laundering aspects. This may explain the limited
number of investigations of crime involving money laundering and cybercrime in responding
countries.
For a common minimum standard of relevant offences which a State should criminalise, see the Council of Europe

Convention on Cybercrime (CETS. 185) at http://conventions.coe.int

82

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Proper rules and regulations in the AML/CFT field with regards to Internet-based payment
systems are not always in place. Targeted legal provisions requiring all Internet based
payment services providers to implement AML/CFT procedures in terms of KYC, CDD and
reporting obligations, will decrease the ML risks associated to this particular industry.
Not only lack of relevant legislation, but also different approaches in different jurisdictions
seem to enable criminals to misuse Internet-based payment methods for money laundering
purposes.
Different sources (FATF, FINCEN, MONEYVAL, countries’ responses to the survey) refer to
different electronic or Internet based payment systems and methods, using different
terminology (e-payment, Internet based payment services, e-currency, new payment
methods etc…). Apparently there is no common and general understanding of the terms used
and sometimes referrals to market leaders or well known providers is being necessary in
order to clarify the actual payment service in question.
In the case of police authorities and public prosecutor’s office, specialisation of officials is
possible and in some jurisdictions even implemented, however this seems to be the exception
rather then the rule. In case of FIU experts, sometimes targeted training programmes are
compulsory with regards to cybercrimes and cyber-laundering, including the mechanisms
governing the Internet payment services.

Conclusion and direction for development

5.3

307.
In terms of countermeasures, the study documents good practices already available and
taken by public and private sector institutions. These elements should inspire action by other countries
and institutions to protect their citizens and financial infrastructure. The following areas are considered
as having the potential to enhance global action and contribute to overall efforts to prevent and
combat money laundering in this context:
308.
Adequate research and measures to prevent or mitigate ML/TF and cybercrime risks. There
is a clear need to undertaken research covering money laundering and cybercrime, with due
consideration of the nature and scale, offenders and accessories used, their modus operandi, the
infrastructures and services targeted, the emerging technologies and related vulnerabilities and
emerging threats. Filling gaps through future research would also enable to target relevant policies and
measures to prevent or mitigate ML/TF/cybercrime to the risks identified. It would also result in an
increased awareness of competent institutions’ and private sector’s representatives on the cybercrime
tools, technologies, and operations in order to identify those that are likely to be primarily targeted by
criminals for ML/TF activities, and as such would result in strengthening detection capabilities to
support action against both cybercrimes and money laundering. Risk management in the private sector
needs to be expanded to capture Internet-related risks.
309.
AML/CFT and anti-cybercrime strategies. Integration into AML/CFT national strategies of
elements targeting money laundering related to cybercrime and Internet-based payment systems has
also been indicated as a possible direction for reflection and action, in particular for those countries
particularly affected. Many cybersecurity strategies consider the financial sector to be part of the
critical information infrastructure that is to be protected against cyber attacks. However, they do not
necessarily cover the issue of criminal money. For this reason, it has been proposed to make financial
investigations and measures against money laundering financial part of cybercrime strategies.70

Cybercrime

310.
Adoption and implementation of comprehensive substantive legislation in this area and of
relevant international standards. Also important in this context is the necessity to update the national
legal framework so as to cover adequately cybercrime, money laundering and procedural law measures
to allow for the preservation, search and seizure of electronic evidence as well as international cooperation,; in line with the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime (CETS 185) and the Convention on
Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of
Terrorism (CETS 198). In this context, specific attention should also be devoted to the implementation
of the FATF revised recommendations which have a direct relevance in this context, and notably those
related to the assessment of risks, those related to new technologies, money or value transfer, wire
transfers, etc.71
311.
Establishment of clear mechanisms and incentives for public reporting on fraud and other
proceeds generating offences on the Internet, or on cybercrime in general, while taking into
consideration the necessity to observe privacy and liability rules. Such reporting mechanisms allow to
determine not only overall trends and threats, but to analyse criminal operations and patterns of
money flows and money laundering, and finally to initiate measures by criminal justice authorities and
financial intelligence units to investigate and ultimately prosecute such offences.
312.
Guidance and typologies. Guidance for financial and non financial institutions which are
subject under AML/CFT legislation to report when they suspect or have reasonable grounds to suspect
that funds are proceeds of a criminal activity could include elements to clarify instances of cybercrimes
which may give rise to a duty to report under national legislation (ie. advance fee fraud, computer
hacking, cyber extortion, identity theft, sale of stolen or counterfeit goods via Internet, credit card
fraud, cyber laundering, etc), specific guidance on risk indicators and recognition of suspicious
behaviour, examples of cases, ML/TF techniques and typologies identified in the national jurisdiction,
and any related information which may assist reporting institutions to comply with their AML/CFT
obligations. Within a financial institution, techniques such as behaviour profiling, monitoring for mule
account activity and “hotlists” of known or suspected accounts can help in the detection of criminal
money flows.
313.
Setting up of specialised units for cybercrime. In many countries, high-tech crime units and
units for cyber-forensics, and in some specialised prosecution services have been created in recent
years. The importance and workload of such units will increase significantly in the very near future and
so will be their need for resources.
314.
Inter-agency cooperation, notably through proactive parallel financial investigations when
pursuing cybercrimes and associated money laundering. Cybercrime and criminal money flows touches
upon the responsibility of a number of institutions. Interagency cooperation, in particular between
authorities responsible for financial investigations, for high-tech crime and financial intelligence units,
will be essential, particularly in the context of major proceeds generating offences. The participation of
cybercrime investigators in permanent or temporary multi-disciplinary groups specialised in financial or
asset investigations should be considered.72 Financial intelligence units may have not only access to
information and intelligence but also analysis capability that would bring an added value and usefully
complement the information gaps in the context of investigations of ML associated with cybercrimes
and criminal money flows.73 The capacity of the financial intelligence unit in this context, both in terms
of sharing of information with other stakeholders or of co-operating may be subject to limitations,
subject to the specificities of the domestic legislation, and should thus be reviewed, especially in
71

See http://www.fatf-gafi.org.

72

Further to FATF Recommendation 30 (as revised, February 2012)

73

FATF Recommendations 30 and 31 (as revised, February 2012) should encourage cooperation and information

exchange between FIUs and law enforcement, including cybercrime investigators.

84

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

jurisdictions particularly affected by these phenomena.74 In many jurisdictions, prosecutors may play a
major role in coordinating different agencies in specific investigations.
315.
Promoting public-private cooperation and information exchange on criminal money flows on
the Internet. The study shows that this is probably the area where the biggest impact can be made.
The creation of trusted fora for information and intelligence between the financial sector, criminal
justice and anti-money laundering authorities should be given consideration
316.
Training of criminal justice and anti-money laundering authorities in matters related to
cybercrime and electronic evidence. Given the increasing relevance of cybercrime and electronic
evidence for most types of crime, such training should be mainstreamed in law enforcement and
judicial training curricula. The need for the training of judges is a key lesson already learned with
regard to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Specific training on criminal money flows
for relevant stakeholders, including FIUs, should be organised in addition.
317.
International cooperation. Linking anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures
and financial investigations with cybercrime investigations and computer forensics offers added
opportunities for international cooperation. International standards – such as Council of Europe
Convention CETS 198, FATF Recommendations or the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime – offer
opportunities that are yet to be fully exploited.75 For example, provisional measures in international
cooperation on money laundering and financial investigations (articles 21 to 22 of the Warsaw
Convention, or FATF Recommendation 38) could be accompanied by provisional measures to preserve
electronic evidence not only by Internet service providers but also other legal or physical persons
(Budapest Convention -articles 16 and 17 for preservation at the domestic level and articles 29 and 30
at the international level). This also applies, modus modendi, to other forms of international
cooperation. FATF Recommendation 40 specifically encourages countries to “permit their competent
authorities to exchange information indirectly with non-counterparts”.76 This should allow for
information exchange between an FIU of one country with a cybercrime unit of another country either
via the FIU of the other country or in urgent cases directly.

Study concept note
Concept note77

Title:

Criminal money flows on the Internet: methods, trends and multi-stakeholder
counteraction

Led by:

Russian Federation and the Council of Europe Secretariat (MONEYVAL Secretariat &
Project on Cybercrime & MOLI Russia Project)

Description:
This project will examine criminal money flows and methods of money laundering through information
and communication technologies (ICT), including the Internet. It will furthermore document good
practices such as multi-stakeholder action aimed at the search and confiscation of crime proceeds and
prevention.
Issues:
Cybercrime is increasingly targeted at generating economic proceeds involving different types of fraud
and economic crime (such as phishing and other forms of identity theft, credit card fraud, auction
fraud, Internet marketing and retail fraud, online gambling, lottery fraud, intellectual property and
related offences, stock market manipulation, advance fee fraud, extortion, espionage, insider trading,
electronic trade in stolen goods and many others) through illegal access, data interception, data and
system interference and with the help of malware, including botnets and spam. The Internet and
information and communication technologies facilitate money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. Commercial websites and Internet payment systems are vulnerable to money laundering
and terrorist financing as documented by the FATF.78 Criminals may receive money to their own
accounts or accounts which they control and from where they can withdraw it, or through accounts of
beneficial owners in different countries, or through e-money, or they launder proceeds through e-gold,
e-casinos, Internet auctions or similar methods. All these crimes are highly transnational in nature.
A wide range of stakeholders is involved in measures against such forms of crime not only from the
public sector but in particular the private sector. Although there are examples of multi-stakeholder
action, efforts remain rather fragmented. Initiatives against fraud on the Internet are not necessarily
linked to activities carried out by financial intelligence units or law enforcement authorities responsible
for financial investigations.
Better knowledge of methods used for fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing on the Internet
through exchange of information between relevant public and private sector stakeholders will help
investigate, seize and confiscate proceeds and prevent fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing.

Approved by the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures

and the Financing of Terrorism (MONEYVAL) in September 2009.

Financial Action Task Force: MONEY LAUNDERING & TERRORIST FINANCING VULNERABILITIES OF COMMERCIAL

WEBSITES AND Internet PAYMENT SYSTEMS (June 2008). The project will also take into account and coordinate
with the ongoing work of the FATF on ML and TF through new payment methods.

86

Criminal money flows on the Internet – March 2011

Objective of the project:
The objective of the project is:
•
to examine specific ML/TF risks and methods, trends and typologies
•
to develop indicators to identify criminal money flows and money laundering on the Internet
•
to identify possible solutions with regard to multi-stakeholder action aimed at preventive
measures, the seizure and confiscation of criminal money and the investigation of money
laundering and terrorist financing on the Internet.
Potential resources required:
The project team will ideally include experts from FIUs, financial investigation services and high-tech
crime units. It will consult with key stakeholders from the private sector so that they can contribute
their experience to the project.
The project team’s work will be assisted by one to two experts (one money laundering/financial
investigation expert, one experienced in high-tech crime) who will support the Project Leader and
Secretariat to coordinate the process and contributions from stakeholders.
Co-operation between MONEYVAL and the Council of Europe’s Projects on Cybercrime and MOLI Russia
will permit a pooling of resources and expertise as well as access to different stakeholders.
Planned product:
The project team will draw up a report consisting of two main parts:
•
Typologies: this part will document identified methods and trends of ML through the Interned,
based on case studies contributed by participating countries and indicators/red flags developed.
•
Good practices: the second part will document good practices in terms of counter-measures, that
is, strategies, policies and investigative techniques. It should in particular provide information and
guidance on multi-stakeholder action involving financial intelligence units, financial investigators,
high-tech crime units and the private sector (ICT industry, financial sector etc.).
