I INTRODUCTION
Montenegro is established by its Constitution as a civil,
democratic, ecological and the state of social justice, based on the rule of
law. Bearer of sovereignty is the citizen with Montenegrin citizenship.
The Constitution of Montenegro creates a legal basis for promoting,
strengthening and improving protection of fundamental human rights
and freedoms, and confirms the commitment of Montenegro to comply
with international standards in that context.
In addition to fundamental human rights and freedoms, and in
order to protect overall national identity, the Constitution and laws of
Montenegro give minorities a set of additional rights. Part two of the
Constitution, Articles 79 and 80, guarantee to persons belonging to
minority nations and other minority national communities the rights
and freedoms, which they can exercise individually or collectively with
others, and prohibits assimilation of persons belonging to minority
nations and other minority national communities. The state shall
protect the persons belonging to minority nations and other minority
national communities from all forms of forceful assimilation.
Part two of the Constitution contains 65 Articles which guarantee
human rights and freedoms, civil and political, economic, social and
cultural, and the rights of minorities as well.
In addition to national legislation, which guarantees the respect of
fundamental human rights and freedoms, and the rights of minorities,
Montenegro established by a provision of Article 9 of the Constitution
that ratified and published international treaties and generally accepted
rules of international law shall make an integral part of the internal
legal order, and that they shall have the supremacy over the national
legislation and shall be directly applicable when they regulate the
relations differently from the internal legislation.
With regard to UN legal instruments, those are: Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, with both optional protocols, as well as the
Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees, with the Protocol, International Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Convention
on the Rights of the Child, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Also, Montenegro is
4

bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but not as a
contractual obligation, but as an international customary-legal
requirement.
With regards to legal instruments of the Council of Europe, these
are: European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, European Convention for the Prevention of
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities,
Charter on Regional and Minority Languages, European Social Charter.
By entering into force of the European Charter on Regional and
Minority Languages in Montenegro on 6 June 2006, we committed to
implement the principles contained in this international document,
while by Ratification of the European Charter on Regional or Minority
Languages, Montenegro determined that it relates to the use of Albanian
and Romani languages. Changes to the 2011 Law in the field of
education in mother tongue renamed the subject, which had been
named “mother tongue” until then, into the subject named
“Montenegrin, Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian Languages” – four
languages with the same base and origin, as opposed to Albanian and
Romani languages, which are different.
The legislation incorporating the provisions of the European
Charter on Regional and Minority Languages includes the following:
Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, Law on Pre-School Education,
General Law on Education, Law on Higher Education, Law on Public
Broadcasting, Law on Media, Law on Radio-Broadcasting Services Radio
of Montenegro and Television of Montenegro, Law on Personal Name,
Law on Publishing Activity, Law on Cinematography and the Law on
Drama Art, Law on General Administrative Procedures, Law on Local
Self-Government, Law on Election of Members of Parliament and Local
Councillors, Anti-Discrimination Law, Law on Protector of Human
Rights and Freedoms, Statute of the Capital of Montenegro, Rulebook of
the Capital City Council, Rulebook of Town Municipality Tuzi, Statute of
Ulcinj Municipality, Statute of Plav Municipality, Rules of Procedure of
Ulcinj Town Council, Rulebook of Plav Town Council, etc.
The Constitution of Montenegro (Official Gazette of Montenegro
01/07 of 25.10.2007), Article 13 paragraph 1, says that the official
language in Montenegro is Montenegrin, while paragraph 3 prescribes
that Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian shall also be in the official
use.

According to the data of the Statistical Office of Montenegro
(MONSTAT), based on the 2011 census, Montenegro has 620.029
inhabitants: Montenegrins 278.865 (44.91%), Serbs 178.210 (28.73%),
Albanians 30.439 (4.91%), Bosniaks 53.605 (8.65%), Muslims 20537
(3.31%), Roma 6.251 (1.01%) and Croats 6021 (0.97%). According to
these data of the Statistical Office (MONSTAT), the linguistic picture of
Montenegro is as follows: 265895 citizens or 42.88% of the population
speak Serbian language, 229251 citizens or 36.97% of the population
speak Montenegrin language, 32671 citizens or 5.27% of the population
speak Albanian language, 33077 citizens or 5.33% of the population
speak Bosnian language, 5169 citizens or 0.83% of the population speak
Romani language, and 2791 citizens or 0.45% of the population speak
Croatian language.
Strategic framework for minority policy is represented by the
Strategy for Minority Policy adopted on 03 July 2008. In accordance
with comparative-legal international standards, this Strategy defines
measures for implementation of the Law on Minority Rights and
Freedoms and improvement of the living conditions of minorities as a
whole, which the state authorities shall gradually implement in the
period of implementation of the document.
Protection of rights and improvement of the position of minorities
in Montenegro is addressed by several very important institutions and
authorities, such as the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, and a
standing working body – Committee for Human Rights and Freedoms is
established in the Parliament of Montenegro, the Protector of Human
Rights and Freedoms, who acts as an independent and autonomous
institution, Councils of minority nations, Fund for Protection and
Exercising Minority Rights, Centre for the Protection and Development
of Minority Cultures, as well as a number of high quality and active nongovernmental associations and organisations addressing the matters of
protection of minority rights and improvement of the position of
minority communities in the Montenegrin society.
The most important international documents and national legal
acts have been translated into Albanian and Romani languages, such as:
the Strategy for Improving the Position of RAE population in
Montenegro 2008–2012 and 2012–2016, Law on Media, European
Charter on Regional and Minority Languages, Declaration on the Rights
of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Language
Minorities, Framework Convention for the Protection of National
6

Minorities, Constitution of Montenegro, Law on the Prohibition of
Discrimination and the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, etc.
II BASIC DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS
The latest census of population, households and apartments was
conducted in the period 01-15 April 2011. According to the results of
this census, Montenegro has 620.029 inhabitants, 50.61% or 313.793
are women, and 49.39% or 306.236 are men. Podgorica has the largest
population (185.937), which represents 30% of the total population of
Montenegro, followed by Niksic and Bijelo Polje. Around 50% of the
total population is concentrated in these three municipalities.
Municipalities with the smallest population are Savnik (2.070), Pluzine
(3.246) and Zabljak (3.569).
Urban-type settlements are a home to 392.020 inhabitants, which
represents 63% of the total population, while 228.009 inhabitants live
in other settlements.
In accordance with the Methodology for preparation, organization
and implementation of the census, a person was not obliged to declare
his/her nationality or ethnicity, or religion and mother tongue. If a
person did not want to declare with regard to the above matters, the
answer “Does not want to declare” was written down. This answer to
the question on national, i.e. ethnical belonging was given by 4.87% of
citizens, 3.99% of citizens gave this answer to the question on mother
tongue, and 2.61% of citizens gave this answer to the question on
religion.
Nationalities, ethnicities respectively, mother tongue and
religions, which make less than 100 inhabitants in Montenegro, are
classified in the category “Other”.

III LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF MINORITIES IN
MONTENEGRO
1. Human rights and protection of minorities in the Constitution of
Montenegro
The Constitution of Montenegro provides a legal basis for
promoting, strengthening and improving the protection of fundamental
human rights and freedoms, and confirms the commitment of
Montenegro to comply with international standards in that context.
Almost half of Articles of the Constitution (68 of 158) relate to human
rights and freedoms, which represents a legislative confirmation of their
importance. The Constitution of Montenegro guarantees equal rights
and obligations to all citizens, regardless of any particularities or
personal attributes, and prohibits any direct or indirect discrimination
on any grounds. The Constitution also defines an affirmative action, i.e.
it says that regulations and introduction of special measures aimed at
creating the conditions for the exercise of national, gender and overall
equality and protection of persons who are in an unequal position on
any grounds shall not be considered discrimination.

10

The main provisions of the Constitution include three provisions
which are essential for enjoying human rights and freedoms. Article 6
gives an overall guarantee for the protection of human rights and
freedoms, as inviolable categories. Article 7 prescribes the prohibition
of infliction or encouragement of hatred or intolerance on any grounds,
and Article 8 prescribes the prohibition of discrimination, as a general
precondition for enjoying all human rights and freedoms. More
specifically, Article 8 guarantees prohibition of any “direct or indirect
discrimination on any grounds”, and also “regulations and introduction
of special measures aimed at creating the conditions for the exercise of
national, gender and overall equality and protection of persons who are
in an unequal position on any grounds shall not be considered
discrimination. Special measures may only be applied until the
achievement of the aims for which they were undertaken”, which leaves
room for the establishment of additional mechanisms for protection and
promotion of minority rights, and for integration of minorities while
preserving their specificities.
Part two of the Constitution contains 65 Articles which guarantee
human rights and freedoms, civil and political, economic, social and
cultural, and minority rights.
In addition to national legislation, which guarantees the respect of
fundamental human rights and freedoms, and the rights of minorities,
Montenegro established by a provision of Article 9 of the Constitution
that ratified and published international agreements and generally
accepted rules of international law shall make an integral part of the
internal legal order, and that they shall have the supremacy over the
national legislation and shall be directly applicable when they regulate
the relations differently from the internal legislation.
With regards to UN legal instruments, these are: Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights, with both optional protocols, as well as the
Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, Convention relating
to the Status of Refugees, with the Protocol, International Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Convention
on the Rights of the Child, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Also, Montenegro is
bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but not as a
contractual obligation, but as an international customary-legal
requirement.
11

With regards to legal instruments of the Council of Europe, these
are: European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, European Convention for the Prevention of
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities,
Charter on Regional and Minority Languages, European Social Charter.
The guarantees given by the highest legal act of Montenegro are
elaborated by a set of laws regulating labour relations, employment,
pension and disability insurance, education, health and social
protection, protection at work, family relations, criminal offences, etc.
2. Special minority rights
In addition to fundamental human rights and freedoms, in order
to protect the overall national identity, the Constitution and laws of
Montenegro give minorities a set of additional rights. Part two of the
Constitution, Articles 79 and 80, guarantee to persons belonging to
minority nations and other minority national communities the rights
and freedoms, which they can exercise individually or collectively with
others, and prohibits assimilation of persons belonging to minority
nations and other minority national communities. The state shall
protect the persons belonging to minority nations and other minority
national communities from all forms of forceful assimilation.
The Constitution guarantees the following individual – minority
rights:
 the right to exercise, protect, develop and publicly express
national, ethnic, cultural and religious particularities;
 the right to choose, use and publicly post national symbols and to
celebrate national holidays;
 the right to use their own language and script in private, public
and official use;
 the right to education in their own language and script in public
institutions and the right to have included in the curricula the
history and culture of the persons belonging to minority nations
and other minority national communities;
 the right, in the areas with significant share in the total
population, to have the local self-government authorities, state
and court authorities carry out the proceedings in the language of
minority nations and other minority national communities;
12

 the right to establish educational, cultural and religious
associations, with the material support of the state;
 the right to write and use their own name and surname in their
own language and script in the official documents;
 the right, in the areas with significant share in the population, to
have traditional local terms, names of streets and settlements, as
well as topographic signs written in the language of minority
nations and other minority national communities;
 the right to authentic representation in the Parliament of
Montenegro and in the assemblies of the local self-government
units in which they represent a significant share in the population,
according to the principle of affirmative action;
 the right to proportionate representation in public services, state
authorities and local self-government bodies;
 the right to information in their native languages;
 the right to establish and maintain contacts with the citizens and
associations outside of Montenegro, with whom they have
common national and ethnic background, cultural and historic
heritage, as well as religious beliefs;
 the right to establish councils for the protection and promotion of
special rights.
Special measures may only be applied until the achievement of the
aims for which they were undertaken, which leaves room for
establishing of additional mechanisms for protection and promotion of
minority rights, and for integrating minorities while preserving their
specificities. The Constitution of Montenegro (Official Gazette of
Montenegro 01/07 of 25.10.2007), Article 13 paragraph 1, says that the
official language in Montenegro shall be Montenegrin, while paragraph
3 prescribes that Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian shall also be
in the official use.
3. Legal framework
The Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms defines the minority as
any group of citizens of Montenegro, numerically smaller than the rest
of predominant population, having common ethnic, religious or
linguistic characteristics, different from those of the rest of the
population, being historically tied to Montenegro and motivated by the
13

wish to express themselves and maintain their national, ethnic, cultural,
linguistic and religious identity. Minorities are considered to be:
autochthonous numerically minority nations, national minorities and
ethnic minorities. Persons belonging to minority nations and other
minority national communities shall be deemed equal to other citizens
and shall enjoy equal legal protection. Any violation of the rights of
minority nations and other minority national communities shall be
unlawful and punishable. The Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms
(Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro 31/06, 51/06 and
38/07) regulates more closely a set of minority rights and mechanisms
for protection of such rights. The Law relates to protection of national
identity of minorities, i.e. protection from assimilation of minorities, and
provides for effective participation of minorities in public life.
Article 11 of the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms says that
minorities and persons belonging to them shall have the right to use
their language and script. In the local self-government units in which
persons belonging to minorities make majority or considerable part of
the population, according to results of the latest census, the language of
that minority shall be in the official use as well. The official use of
languages of minorities, within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this
Article, shall particularly imply the following: use of language in
administrative and court proceedings and in conducting administrative
and court proceedings, issuance of public documents and keeping
official records, ballot papers and other electoral material, and in the
work of representative bodies. On the territory of the local selfgovernment units referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the names of
bodies exercising public authority, names of the local self-government
units, names of settlements, squares and streets, institutions, business
and other entities and toponyms shall also be written in the language
and script of the minority. In accordance with recommendations of the
Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, the curricula for the purpose of
education shall contain topics relating to history, art, literature,
tradition and culture of the minority nation or other minority national
community.
In addition to the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, the legal
framework regulating the rights of minority nations and other minority
national communities is created by laws and other acts regulating the
exercising of rights in individual fields, such as education, information,
culture, use of language and script, etc. In addition, following a proposal
14

of the Government of Montenegro, the Parliament adopted the general
Law on the Prohibition of Discrimination on 27 July 2010. The Law on
the Prohibition of Discrimination is a systemic law which provides
grounds and mechanisms for fighting against discrimination on the
grounds of any personal trait (race, colour of skin, citizenship, national
affiliation or ethnic origin, religious or political beliefs, gender, gender
identity, sexual orientation, birth, genetic traits, health conditions,
disability, marital and family status, age, membership in political, trade
unions and other organisations, and other actual or assumed personal
traits). Incitement of discrimination is also considered to be
discrimination under this Law. The Law aims to protect every
conscientious citizen who reported cases of discrimination, or gave, in
any capacity, a statement before a competent authority in the
proceeding investigating a case of discrimination – protection from
victimization.
The scope of the Law is defined, i.e. the Law relates to all persons
who are subject to regulations of Montenegro (citizens, foreigners,
IDPs, asylum seekers, etc.). Also, norms of the Law apply to legal
entities if such entities are discriminated on any of the defined
grounds. The terms of harassment, mobbing, segregation are defined,
and a particular emphasis is placed on a severe form of discrimination,
which should guide a court when deciding on a sanction or an amount
of damage compensation. A qualifier of a prohibited treatment directly
guides everyone, particularly courts and other authorities whose task
is to protect human rights, towards a stricter legal response as a
consequence of a prohibited treatment. Therefore, regardless of
whether it is a civil law, criminal law or other legal protection from
discrimination, a state authority is instructed to impose stricter
sanctions for the forms of discrimination that the legislator has
qualified as particularly severe ones.
Among many forms and cases of discrimination, the Law includes
those which prove to be, from aspects of legal order or moral standards,
as particularly severe violations of the principles of equality of humans,
and the cases which are not addressed specifically by a set of separate
laws. The purpose of segregation of certain forms of discrimination is,
primarily, to denote and qualify the prohibited actions which are
considered particularly dangerous for a social community and to
complete possible cases of potential discrimination, which are not
included in separate legal regulations. A special emphasis is placed on
15

discrimination in proceedings before public authorities, discrimination
in using public buildings and areas, discrimination on the grounds of
health conditions, discrimination on the grounds of age, discrimination
in the fields of upbringing, education and vocational training,
discrimination in the field of labour, discrimination on the grounds of
religion and beliefs, discrimination of persons with disabilities,
discrimination on the grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation.
The Law establishes a Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms
Ombudsman as a mechanism for prevention of and protection from
discrimination. Proceedings before the Protector of Human Rights and
Freedoms Ombudsman are regulated by the Law and the secondary
legislation. In addition, the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms,
in a separate part of the annual report, shall inform the Parliament of
Montenegro about observed cases of discrimination and actions
undertaken, and he/she is given an opportunity to submit a separate
report on observed cases of discrimination.
In order to complete the overall system for protection from
discrimination, in addition to the protection provided by the institution
of the Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms, with its competences
and appropriate measures which are imminent in this institutional form
of protection of human rights and freedoms, court protection from
discrimination is regulated as well. Namely, a developed and clearly
regulated court protection is a necessary instrument in fighting against
discrimination.
It is very important to point out that the burden of proof that
discriminatory behaviour has not occurred is on the defendant, which is
a standard in developed democratic societies in fighting against
discriminatory behaviour. Proceedings before court, lawsuit, deadline
for filing the lawsuit, filing of lawsuit by other persons and informing
the Protector are also regulated.
Inspection control over the implementation of this Law with
respect to discrimination in various fields shall be performed by
inspections competent for those fields (provision of services, civil
engineering, health, education, labour and employment, occupational
safety, traffic, tourism, etc.). This clearly defines the role of inspection in
protection from discrimination.
This Law obliges all authorities to keep separate records of cases
of discrimination and to deliver such records to the Protector of
Human Rights and Freedoms. Court authorities, inspection authorities
16

and misdemeanour authorities are also obliged to keep records. The
Ministry for Human and Minority Rights is obliged to prescribe, within
six months, a form and template for keeping records of all cases of
discrimination. The Law clearly indicates misdemeanour punishable
under this Law, since misdemeanour in exercising individual rights are
defined by other laws, and criminal liabilities are defined by criminal
laws.
The Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms (Official Gazette of the
Republic of Montenegro 31/06) in accordance with the Constitution of
Montenegro, Charter on Human and Minority Rights and Civil
Freedoms, and generally accepted rules of international law and ratified
international treaties, regulates, inter alia, a set of minority rights at
local level.
It is prescribed that in the local self-government units in which
persons belonging to minorities make majority or considerable part of
the population, according to results of the latest census, the language of
that majority shall also be in the official use. The official use of
languages of minorities shall particularly imply: use of the language in
administrative and court proceedings and in conducting administrative
and court proceedings, in issuance of public documents and keeping
official records, ballot papers and other electoral material, as well as in
the work of representative bodies. The Law also prescribes that on the
territories of local self-government, the names of bodies performing
public authority, name of the local self-government unit, names of
settlements, squares and streets, institutions, business and other
entities and toponyms shall also be written in the language and script of
the minority (Article 11). According to international standards, local
self-government is a form of participation of minorities in public life.
The Law on Local Self-Government (Official Gazette of the
Republic of Montenegro 42/03, 28/04, 75/05 and 13/06 and Official
Gazette of Montenegro 88/09, 3/10, 73/10 and 38/12, 10/14)
prescribes that, when performing their activities, local self-government
authorities shall provide equal protection of rights and legal interests of
the local population and legal entities provided by the law, and that the
municipality shall provide conditions for the protection and promotion
of minority rights as well, in accordance with the Constitution,
international legal acts and separate laws (Article 10), and that the Law
on the Capital City establishes Town Municipalities Golubovci and Tuzi
for the purpose of more efficient performance of activities under the
17

competence of the Capital. Majority of the population of the Town
Municipality Tuzi is Albanian population. In municipalities where
Albanian population makes majority or a considerable part of the
population of a local self-government unit, their decisions put in
practice the defined minority rights relating to having names of
settlements, streets and municipalities written in Albanian language. In
addition to the above, in territories where Albanians are majority
population, they have the right to use national symbols.
Unlike other minority nations and minority national communities,
who are integrated in modern trends of the Montenegrin society, Roma
and Egyptians are the most vulnerable and the most marginalized
minority national community in Montenegro. For the purpose of
affirmation and promotion of the rights of this community, local selfgovernment units (Capital City-Podgorica, Berane, Bijelo Polje, Niksic,
Tivat) have adopted actions plans containing sets of systemic measures
and activities which need to be implemented in order to achieve
integration of Roma and Egyptians in the fields of legal, political,
economic and social, and cultural and information life, bearers,
deadlines and funds needed, as well as sets of instruments for
monitoring and assessing impact of undertaken measures.
Implementation of action plans is aimed at contributing to improved
quality of living conditions of Roma and Egyptians and at encouraging
their integration in the local community. Municipalities undertake
significant activities towards integration and improvement of the
quality of life of Roma and Egyptians by addressing housing needs of
this community, organizing educational and motivational workshops for
RE parents on the importance and advantages of education, employing
RE in local government authorities established by the municipality,
improving their material status, mostly through programmes of one-off
financial support. The Ministry of Interior, in cooperation with the
Union of Municipalities of Montenegro and other ministries, gives
awards for best practices in certain thematic fields, and so far Berane
municipality received an award in 2013 for the practice “Improvement
of integration of Roma and Egyptians in the municipality of Berane”.
Systemic laws in the field of education have considered the
concept of general constitutional guarantee relating to education of
minorities, at the level of general goals and principles of education, and
at the level of individual provisions. Essentially, the system aims at
integration of minorities, with maintaining their identity. Students
18

belonging to minority communities have the right to education in
mother tongue. The emphasis is on the curricula, which includes topics
in the field of mother tongue and literature, history, art and culture of
minorities and other contents promoting mutual tolerance and
coexistence. In addition to the contents included in regular subjects, an
opportunity is available for using 20% of free contents for
particularities in terms of national culture, history, art. Education in
Albanian is organized at all levels of education, from preschool to higher
education. Also, the curricula of institutions and schools providing
education in the language in official use includes topics relating to
mother tongue and literature, history, art and culture of minorities, and
other contents which contribute to mutual tolerance and coexistence. In
addition to contents included in regular curricula, an opportunity is
available for using 20% of free contents for particularities in terms of
national culture, history, art.
The right to information in one’s native language, besides the
right to education, preservation and development of the culture, and the
right to official use of the language and script shall constitute one of the
fundamental minority rights which are guaranteed under the
Constitution of Montenegro. The Constitution, also, guarantees the
freedom of press and other types of informing, as well as the right to
establish newspapers and other means of public informing with the
entry at the competent body. The Constitution of Montenegro provides
that the members of national and ethnic groups have the right to freely
use their language and script, the right to education and the right to
information in their native languages.
Media legislation includes special provisions related to informing
the members of minority and ethnic groups in their native languages.
The Law on Public Broadcasting Services of Montenegro (Official
Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro 79/08), Article 8, states that
“’Radio – Television of Montenegro may, for the needs of certain public
broadcasting services, establish regional radio and television studios,
having a special obligation of production and broadcasting regional
programs into minority nations’ languages and other minority national
communities in that area.”
The obligation of production and broadcasting different program
contents (informative, cultural, artistic, educational, scientific, sports,
children and others) has been established, without any type of

19

discrimination or social differentiation, in order to satisfy the interests
of the public on national and local level.
Production and broadcasting of the programs are ‘’intended for all
society segments, especially taking into consideration children and the
youth, members of minorities and other minority national communities,
the disabled, socially endangered, and other specific groups”. (Article 9
item 4 of the Law on Public Broadcasting Services of Montenegro,
Official Gazette of the Republic of Montenegro 79/08)
Complying with the editors’ independence of the Radio and
Television of Montenegro has also been established, with RTCG deciding
independently on the content of its programs, terms and manner for
broadcasting, obeying professional standards and program rules
adopted by the RTCG Council, whereas they are obliged to inform the
public truly, comprehensively, impartially and timely on the events and
circumstances which are of public interest, to contribute to the respect
for and promotion of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms,
democratic values and institutions, idea pluralism, enhancing the
culture and public dialogue and respecting ethical standards, privacy
and dignity of the citizens.
Article 3 of the Law on Media (Official Gazette of the Republic of
Montenegro 51/02, 62/02) sets forth that the State shall provide for a
part of the funds for exercising the citizens’ right to being informed
without discrimination, guaranteed by the Constitution and legislation.
The Republic shall direct the funds for broadcasting in Albanian and in
languages of other national and ethnic groups, in order to exercise the
said rights under the Constitution.
A set of media laws regulates the field of information in
accordance with the Constitution and at the level of standards contained
in international documents on human rights and freedoms (OUN, OSCE,
Council of Europe, EU).
4. Institutional framework for protection of minority nations and other
minority national communities in Montenegro
Protection of rights and improvement of the position of minority
nations and other minority national communities in Montenegro is
addressed by several very important institutions and authorities.
As a product of democratic breakthrough and main aspirations
contained in the 1997 “Agreement on Minimum Principles for
20

Development of a Democratic Infrastructure in Montenegro”, already
the following year, after early parliamentary elections and constitution
of the new Government, the Ministry for Protection of the Rights of
National and Ethnic Groups was constituted. In the new organizational
structure of the Government of Montenegro, this Ministry was renamed
into the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, and received
competences for monitoring and protecting the human rights which are
not the responsibility of other sectors. Objective of this Government
sector is to monitor and examine, and provide protection of the rights of
minorities in accordance with the Constitution of Montenegro and
international documents relating to the same matters, in accordance
with democratic trends that Montenegro strives towards.
Having in mind the programme orientation of the Ministry for
Human and Minority Rights, this Ministry is working towards
implementation of its main strategic projections. The foundation of this
strategy is a full integration of minority nations in the social life with
further protection and development of their national and cultural
particularities, and promotion of their legal rights and freedoms. This is
achieved by continuous communication between the Ministry and
representatives of all minority nations, political entities, nongovernmental organisations, institutions and establishments, and
through partnerships with relevant international organisations and
institutions addressing matters of protection of human and minority
rights.
The Parliament of Montenegro established a standing working
body – the Committee on Human Rights and Freedoms, which considers
matters, particularly legislative proposals, in the field of human and
minority rights.
The Protector of Human Rights and Freedoms Ombudsman also
acts as an independent and autonomous institution. The Protector of
Human Rights and Freedoms in Montenegro Ombudsman protects
human rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, law, ratified
international treaties on human rights, and generally accepted rules of
international law, when such rights are violated by an act, action or
failure of state authorities, local self-government authorities and public
services, and other holders of public authority. This is the authority that
citizens can refer to, easily, without special formalities and costs, for a
prompt and efficient intervention, but it can also act on own initiative.
Proceedings before the Protector are confidential and no one who files a
21

complaint, or participates in any way in the proceedings conducted by
the Protector, may not be held accountable for that or put in a
disadvantage on such grounds. The Protector communicates his/her
findings, views and opinions to the Parliament and general public, thus
contributing to openness and transparency of public administrative and
other public services and authorities towards the Parliament,
Government, public and citizens. According to existing legislative
solutions, the Protector has a number of deputies, one of whom
addresses protection of minority rights. Having in mind the programme
orientation of the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights, this Ministry
is working towards implementation of its main strategic projections.
One of the main strategies of the Ministry is a full integration of
minority nations in the social life with further protection and
development of their national and cultural particularities, and
promotion of their legal rights and freedoms. Strengthening of existing
and activities of new institutions, such as minority councils, Centre for
the Protection and Development of Minority Cultures, Fund for
Protection and Exercise of Minority Rights, ministries of the
Government of Montenegro, cooperation between local selfgovernments and state institutions, adds quality to institutional
protection of minority rights.
Minority councils – For the purpose of implementation of the Law
on Minority Rights and Freedoms, Ministry for Human and Minority
Rights adopted secondary legislation which specifies the composition
and number of members of minority councils, method of electing
councils, method of summoning and work of electoral assembly, method
of electing members of councils, and provide clear guidelines for this
process. These acts have created legal preconditions for election of
minority councils. The Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms specifies
competences of councils, and they are registered with the Ministry for
Human and Minority Rights. The work of the councils has been funded
through this Ministry since August 2008. Electoral assemblies were held
and new parliaments of Albanian, Bosniak, Croatian, Muslim, Roma and
Serbian National Councils were constituted in 2013. Pursuant to Article
34 of the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms (Official Gazette of the
Republic of Montenegro 31/06, 51/06 and 38/07 and Official Gazette of
Montenegro 02/11) and the Rulebook on the Form and Method of
Keeping Records of Councils (Official Gazette of Montenegro 37/08), the

22

Ministry rendered decisions and inscribed all National Councils in
Montenegro into the Register of Councils.
The Council shall, inter alia:
 represent and act on behalf of the relevant minority;
 submit proposals to state bodies, local self-government bodies
and public services in charge of promotion and development of
the rights of minorities and persons belonging to them;
 lodge initiative to the President of Montenegro for refusal to
promulgate a law by which the rights of minorities and persons
belonging to them are violated;
 participate in planning and founding of educational and pedagogic
institutions;
 provide an opinion on curricula which reflect specificities of
minorities;
 suggest enrolment of certain number of students at the University
of Montenegro;
 launch initiative for amendment of legislation and other acts
which regulate rights of persons belonging to minorities;
 also perform other activities in accordance with the present Law.
On matters discussed by state authorities and public services, which
relate to rights of minorities and persons belonging to them, a necessary
cooperation with the Council shall be established in order to build
mutual confidence.
State and other competent bodies shall inform the Council about
undertaken measures within 30 days from the day of launching of the
initiative or a request within the meaning of paragraph 1 of this Article.
The Centre for the Protection and Development of Minority Cultures is
an institution founded by the Government of Montenegro, which
recognized the importance of interculturality and Montenegrin cultural
diversity, with the aim to promote minority rights in the field of culture
and affirmation of multiculturalism as one of the fundamental values of
modern Montenegro. The Centre is achieving these goals by
development and research activities, studying cultures of minority
nations, their specificities, values and importance, by creating
documented foundation in all fields of life, culture and art related to
minorities in Montenegro. The Centre promotes, affirms, encourages,
protects and develops minority cultures by organizing various events,
contents, projects, round tables, workshops, presentations, etc. Culture
23

and protection of cultural heritage is one of the main segments of the
protection of the overall national identity.
By the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, Article 36, and by
the Decision on Establishing the Fund for Minorities (Official Gazette of
Montenegro 13/08 of 26.02.2008; 64/11 of 29.12.2011), the Parliament
of Montenegro established the Fund for protection and exercise of
minority rights for the purpose of supporting the activities important
for preserving and developing national, i.e. ethnical specificities of
minority nations and other minority national communities and persons
belonging to them, in the fields of national, cultural, linguistic and
religious identity.
The financial means for the Fund are secured from the Budget of
Montenegro and from other sources, in accordance with the law.
Minimum 0.15% of the total budgetary funds are allocated for this
purpose from the Budget of Montenegro, decreased by the budget of
state funds and the capital budget.
The financial means of the Fund are allocated, by decisions of the
Management Board, as follows:
- financial means for the work (functioning) of the Fund, and
- funds for financial support to projects.
The financial means of the Fund for financial support to projects are
allocated through public tenders, based on the following criteria:
 contribution that a project provides to preservation and
development of national, cultural, religious, linguistic and
ethnical identity;
 compatibility of a project with strategic documents of the
Government;
 transparency and a possibility to control a project’s
implementation;
 credibility of an entity proposing a project.
Non-governmental organisations and other legal entities and
natural persons, whose activities, i.e. actions are aimed at preservation
and development of national, i.e. ethnic specificities of minority nations
or other minority national communities and persons belonging to them,
in the fields of national, ethnical, cultural, linguistic and religious
identity, have the right to participate in a public tender for allocation of

24

funds referred to in paragraph 3 indent 2 of this Article. (Article 2,
indent 5).
The Fund provides encouragement and support to the protection,
development and affirmation of specificities of minority nations and
other minority national and ethnic communities in Montenegro, in the
fields of national, ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity, and to
protection and promotion of minority rights and freedoms, by financing
and co-financing quality projects/programmes which are important for
minority national communities and persons belonging to them. The
Fund for Protection and Exercising of Minority Rights of Montenegro is
an institution where applicants can submit their project proposals in
languages in the official use, including Albanian language, in addition to
the official language. The website of the Fund offers applications in the
official language (Latin and Cyrillic scripts) and in Albanian language.
Also, users of funds, and other interested parties, can send
correspondence in Albanian language to the Fund.
A number of very quality and active non-governmental
associations and organisations exist in Montenegro, and they address
matters relating to protection of minority rights and promotion of the
position of minority communities in the Montenegrin society.
5. Strategic policy framework for minority nations and other minority
national communities
Strategic framework for minority policy is represented by the
Strategy for Minority Policy adopted on 03 July 2008. In accordance
with comparative-legal international standards, this Strategy defines
measures for implementation of the Law on Minority Rights and
Freedoms and improvement of living conditions of minorities as a
whole, which state authorities shall gradually implement in the period
of implementation of the document. In that respect, the Strategy
represents a set of specific measures and activities of legal, political,
economic, social, cultural and informative, educational and any other
nature, for the next ten-year period, and it defines bearers, timeframes
and financial costs, primarily of sectors of the Government of
Montenegro, for the purpose of the overall improvement of the position
of minorities and their better integration in social trends. The Strategy
creates preconditions for implementation of the policy for protection
and promotion of minority rights in Montenegro, which implies specific
25

implementation of international-legal standards and constitutional and
legal standards based thereon, in relation to human and minority rights.
The Strategy also implies coordinated, joint and synchronized efforts
and activities of the Government of Montenegro, in financial and any
other terms, international community and organized civil sector in
Montenegro (particularly various non-governmental organisations in
the field of protection and promotion of human and minority rights).
Strategy for Improving the Position of Roma and Egyptians in
Montenegro 2012-2016 was adopted on 05 April 2012. The Strategy
represents a set of specific measures and activities of legal, political,
economic, social, urban-communal, educational, cultural-informative,
health and any other nature, their bearers, timeframes and financial
costs for the next four-year period. In addition to main objectives and
intentions to be achieved by the implementation of this document, the
Strategy defines fields of actions, priority tasks, methods of
implementation, duration of the strategy, evaluation mechanisms, etc.
The following are defined as priority fields: solving legal status of the RE
population (registration and solving the issue of personal documents),
education, preservation of culture and tradition, information,
employment and the rights in the field of labour relations, health and
health care, social and protection of children, violence against women
and domestic violence, improvement of housing conditions and
participation in public and political life.
IV LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE OF THE MONTENEGRIN
LEGISLATION WITH THE EUROPEAN CHARTER ON
REGIONAL AND MINORITY LANGUAGES

The Charter on Regional and Minority Languages defines minority
languages as languages traditionally used within a given territory of a State
by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest
of the State’s population and that are different from the official language of
that State, not including either dialects of the official language of the State or
the languages of migrants. As part of its preparation for the ratification of
the European Charter on Minority and Regional Languages, Montenegro
drew on the existing practices in the official use of language and script and
the use of language in culture, education, judicial and administrative
proceedings to specify that the minority languages in respect of which

26

Montenegro undertook to apply the measures under Part Three of the
Charter are Albanian and Romani.
The legislation incorporating the provisions of the European Charter
on Regional and Minority Languages includes the following: Law on
Minority Rights and Freedoms (Article 11), Law on Pre-School Education
(Article 24), General Law on Education (Articles 4, 11, 22 and 46), Law on
Higher Education (Articles 6 and 7), Law on Public Broadcasting (Article
95, paras. 3, 5 and 6, Article 100), Law on Media (Articles 3 and 10), Law
on Radio-Broadcasting Services Radio of Montenegro and Television of
Montenegro (Article 4, 11, para. 2 and Article 15, para. 8), Law on Personal
Name (Article 2, para. 3), Law on Publishing Activity, Law on
Cinematography, Law on Drama Art, Law on General Administrative
Procedure (Article 15), Law on Local Self-Government (Articles 10 and 84),
Law on Election of Members of Parliament and Local Councillors, Law on
the Prohibition of Discrimination, Law on Protector of Human Rights and
Freedoms, Statute of the Capital of Montenegro, Rule Book of the Capital
City Council, Rule Book of Town Municipality of Tuzi, Statute of Ulcinj
Municipality, Rule Book of Plav Town Council, and the Decision on
Assignment of Polling Stations for the Election of Five Members to the
Parliament of Montenegro.
In its instrument of ratification of the European Charter on Regional
and/or Minority Languages, Montenegro accepted Albanian and Romani as
minority languages as other languages (Serbian, Bosnian and Croatian) are
related and almost identical languages.
Montenegrin is the official language in Montenegro, while the
languages in the official use are Serbian, Bosnian, Croatian and Albanian.
The official use of a language implies, in particular, the use of such language
in administrative and judicial proceedings, in the conduct of administrative
and judicial proceedings, in issuance of public documents, in public records,
in ballots and other election material, and in the work of representative
bodies.
There are clear and visible indicators that the Albanian minority in
Montenegro exercises its right to the official use of language and script.
Administrative proceedings are conducted in the official language, but
members of the Albanian minority are allowed to follow the course of
administrative proceedings with the assistance of an interpreter and to be
given, upon request, a transcript of the decision or ruling in Albanian in
those municipalities where the Albanian minority is the majority or a
significant part of their population. This applies to the municipalities of
Ulcinj, Podgorica, Plav, and the town municipality of Tuzi. Members of the
27

Albanian minority acting as parties to administrative proceedings are further
allowed to make their applications with the competent local administration
bodies in Albanian, but they have so far not used this right. The competent
local administration bodies in the above municipalities issue documents also
in Albanian, upon prior request of the parties.
The use of Albanian is allowed in local town councils when
regulations and other documents are debated, as well as in parliamentary
committees. Draft legislation adopted by the Parliament is published also in
Albanian, while at local administration levels, general regulations are
published in Albanian in the town municipality of Tuzi, and partly in Ulcinj
municipality.
The following paragraphs make an overview of the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CrimPC’) and Civil Procedure
Code (‘CivPC’) that govern this matter.
Under Article 7, para. 2, Criminal Procedure Code, the courts in
whose judicial districts members of minorities and other minority ethnic
groups make a significant part of the population undertake to provide that
the language of minorities is also in the official use in the criminal
proceedings of that court, as provided by law. Article 8, para. 2 of CrimPC
further provides that parties, witnesses, and other persons involved in the
proceedings are entitled to use in such proceedings their own language or
another language that they understand. Where the proceedings are not held
in the language of one of the persons involved, interpretation and translation
will be provided of any statements, documents, and other written evidence.
The persons from para. 2 of this Article shall be notified of their rights. They
may waive these rights if they understand the language of the proceedings
(Article 8, para. 3 CrimPC). If a minority language is one of the languages in
the official use in a court, the court shall serve the filings in the minority
language to the members of that minority who used that language in the
proceedings (Article 9, para. 4, CrimPC).
Particularly significant is Article 17, para. 2 of the CrimPC, which
governs inadmissible evidence. It says that a court judgment may not be
based on evidence obtained through a violation of human rights and
fundamental freedoms enshrined by the Constitution or ratified international
agreements, or on evidence obtained through a violation of criminal
procedure rules, or other evidence that served as source of such information,
nor can such evidence be used in the proceedings.This provision obviously
refers also to the evidence obtained in violation of CrimPC provisions that
govern the use of language in criminal proceedings. Also significant is
Article 226, para. 6 of CrimPC, which says that the translation cost incurred
28

in the application of CrimPC provisions governing the rights of parties,
witnesses and other persons taking part in the proceedings to use their own
language is not to be collected from persons who under the provisions of
CrimPC have the duty to repay the cost of criminal proceedings.
In addition, the Civil Procedure Code includes provisions governing
the use of language in civil proceedings. Article 7, para. 1 of CivPC says that
civil proceedings are to be held in a language that is in the official use in
court. Parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings who do not
understand or speak the language in the official use in court may use their
own language or the language that they understand. Article 99, CivPC says
that parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings may use their
own language or another language that they understand (para. 1); where the
proceedings are not held in the language of the parties or of other persons
taking part in the proceedings, they will be provided, upon request,
interpretation into their own language or another language that they
understand of all the filings, as well as of what is presented at the hearing
(para. 2), parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings are to be
notified of the right to follow the oral proceedings before the court in their
language with the assistance of an interpreter (para. 3). Further, Article 100,
para. 1 of CivPC provides for summons, decisions and other courts filings to
be served on the parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings in
the language in the official use in court. Where a minority language is a
language in the official use in court, the court is to serve the filings in that
language on the parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings who
are members of that minority and who use that language in court (Article
100, para. 2 CivPC). Article 101, para. 1 of CivPC provides that parties and
other persons taking part in the proceedings are to file action, appeals and
other submissions with a court in a language that is in the official use in that
court. Parties and other persons taking part in the proceedings may also file
their filings with the court in the language of minorities which is not in the
official use in court, where so provided by law (Article 101, para. 2, CivPC).
Particularly significant is Article 102 of CivPC, which says that the cost of
translation into the language of national minorities that is incurred in the
application of the provisions of the Constitution and this Code governing the
rights of minorities to use their language is to be covered by the court
concerned. This provision makes sure the members of national minorities do
not give up using their language in court proceedings in order to avoid the
cost of translation, and thus protects their right to free access to court and
their right to a fair trial.

29

Following the examination of the above cited CrimPC and CivPC
provisions, and their comparison with the relevant provisions of Article 9 of
the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages, in relation to
Article 3 of the Law on Ratification, a conclusion can be drawn that the
provision of Montenegro’s procedural legislation is harmonised with Article
9 of the Charter.
Proceedings before the Administrative Court with respect to the right
to the use of language is subject to the provision of the Civil Procedure
Code. The Law on Administrative Dispute (“Official Gazette of RME”, No.
60/2003), Article 55, says that all issues relating to administrative
proceedings not regulated by that law shall be subject to the provisions of
the Civil Procedure Code.
All the courts where the Charter is applied to Albanian and Romani
have a Free Legal Aid Service, where aid is given free of charge by lawyers
paid by the state budget and where members of Roma population make a
significant part of the clients because of their poor financial status. This
service allows members of Roma population free access to court as well as
the right to a fair trial in proceedings that they take part in.
Where parties, witnesses and other persons taking part in proceedings
use regional or minority languages, the court notifies them of the possibility
for them to use their mother tongue and arranges for the translation of their
statements, documents and other written documents to be provided by an
interpreter to be paid from the state budget. In addition, parties to
proceedings may produce evidence made in their mother tongue together
with their translation by certified interpreters, with such evidence having the
same validity as domestic documents.
The Ministry of Justice of Montenegro appointed a total of 39
certified interpreters for Albanian, which, in the opinion of the courts where
Albanians make a significant part of the population, is sufficient for full
implementation of Article 9 of the Charter. However, as Romani is not yet a
standardised language, there are no certified interpreters for Romani in
Montenegro yet.
In addition to the constitutional provisions allowing free use of
language and script, the Law on Personal Name, Article 2, para. 3, provides
that members of national and ethnic groups may have their name written in
their script. Also, the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms (Article 10),
gives members of minorities the right to a free choice and use of their
personal and family name and names of their children, as well as the right to
have such names entered in registers of births and personal documents in
their language and script. In addition to this right given to individuals, the
30

law grants the right also to minority organisations, associations, institutions
and societies to have their name in a minority language and to have it written
in a minority language. The Law on Personal Name was enacted on 29 July
2008 and its Article 5, para. 2 clearly states that a Montenegrin national can
have their personal name entered in birth registers in one of the languages in
the official use (Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian and Croatian).
The Law on Identity Card was enacted on 29 November 2007. Its
Article 7 says: “the ID form is printed in Montenegrin and English and filled
out in Montenegrin. For citizens who use Serbian, Bosnian, Albanian or
Croatian in the official use, the ID form and the data entered will be in those
languages, with the exception of the name and surname, that are entered in
the language and script of the applicant, upon their request”. In receiving the
required documentation for issuance of personal documents, the authorised
officer has the duty to inform the applicant of their rights and ask which
language they would like their documents to be in.
Law on Birth Registers (adopted at the same time as the Law on
Personal Name) governs the registration of birth, marriage, death, and other
data, as set by law, that either refer to or are related to personal and family
status of Montenegrin nationals derived in Montenegro or another state, as
well as of foreign nationals and stateless persons. It is prescribed by law that
registers of birth, marriage, and death are kept in Montenegrin, and that
extracts and certificates from such registers are issued in Montenegrin. It is
also provided by law that where register data are on members of minorities
and other minority ethnic groups, they must be also entered in the language
and script of such minorities, as set by law. The personal name of a member
of minority is entered in the birth register in their language and script in
accordance with law. Birth register extracts and certificates are issued to a
member of minority in the language and script of the minority they belong
to.
V IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EUROPEAN CHARTER ON
REGIONAL AND MINORITY LANGUAGES
1. Part I and II

Montenegro does not have a regulatory body specifically devoted to
monitoring the implementation of the European Charter on Regional and
Minority Languages. This is done by line ministries instead, according to
their respective sphere of competence, by their departments or sectors
dealing with minority rights and freedoms and their promotion.
31

Albanian is in the official use in Podgorica, Plav and Ulcinj, as well as in
the town municipality of Tuzi.
Romani is recognised as a separate minority language by the
Government of Montenegro under its ratification of the European Charter on
Regional and Minority Languages, but is not included in the education
system. Therefore, Romani as a minority language is not represented as a
mother tongue in education institutions because it is not standardised and
because there is no qualified teaching staff to provide teaching in Romani.
The rights of minorities and other minority ethnic groups with respect
to their education are governed by the Constitution of Montenegro, the Law
on Minority Rights and Freedoms, Law on General Education, Law on
Higher Education and other education legislation.
The Constitution guarantees members of minorities and other minority
ethnic groups the rights and freedoms that can be exercised individually or
together with others. One of the guaranteed rights is to be taught in one’s
own language and script in state institutions, and that curricula include the
history and culture of members of minorities and other minority ethnic
groups.
The Ministry of Education provides support to projects significant to the
improvement of status of Roma population, particularly those that refer to
the exercise of the rights to education. In addition, the Ministry supports the
activities of the non-governmental sector aiming to standardise and codify
Romani.
Montenegro has good regional co-operation with former Yugoslav
republics in issues relating to education in minority and regional languages,
in Romani in particular. Positive experience in this area is followed and
implemented to the extent possible. The work is now underway on
compiling the first Romani dictionary, with a plan to also write the Romani
grammar. This is undertaken in order to first standardise and codify Romani
so that it has the form of a literary language and to train qualified teaching
staff so that Romani can then be introduced in the education system. The
Ministry of Education will support the progress made towards codification
and standardisation of Romani in the countries in the region provided
relevant representatives of Roma population in Montenegro have a positive
attitude towards these achievements.
Conditions are not in place yet to introduce Romani as the language of
teaching in pre-school, primary or secondary schools. Once Romani has
been codified and standardised and the teaching staff qualified and trained to
provide teaching in Romani, education and teaching can be realised in
Romani at the level of pre-school, primary and secondary education.
32

Until the above conditions are put in place, i.e. until Romani can be fully
introduced in the education system, Romani language, culture, history,
customs and tradition is learned and taught in summer schools/camps.
The project Through Desegregation to a Full Integration is implemented
with the participation, among others, of the Ministry of Education,
Education Bureau, and the Ministry of Human and Minority Rights. Roma
assistants have been introduced to help Roma students with language issues to facilitate understanding and communication between teachers and
students, and improve student overall performance at school.
In accordance with Article 2, para. 2 of the Charter, the paragraphs
and/or sub-paragraphs that can apply to selected minority or regional
languages are listed below.
Part II
Article 7
Paragraph 3
One of the ways in which mutual understanding and tollerance is
promoted between all linguistic groups in Montenegro in the education
sector is by designing compulsory and elective courses at school. Namely,
knowledge and skills in human rights and multiculturalism are acquired as
part of both mandatory and elective courses. Mandatory courses with such
content include the following: Civic Education in VI and VII grades of
primary school, History in higher grades of primary school and in secondary
school, Geography in higher grades of primary school and in secondary
school, Sociology in secondary school, Mother Tongue (MontenegrinSerbian, Bosnian, Croatian Language and Literature, under amendments to
the General Law on Education of 9 September 2011) in all grades of primary
and secondary school. Elective courses with the content on human rights and
multiculturalism are the following: Humanitarian Law in VIII and IX grade
of primary school, the European Union in VIII and IX grade of primary
school, History of Religion in secondary school, and European Integration in
secondary school. In addition, multiculturalism is an integral part of courses
in music and foreign languages, taken as compulsory and elective courses,
such as English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian and Turkish.
Civic Education was introduced as a compulsory course in VI and VII
grade, and is taken as an elective course from I to IV course of grammar 1
school. These courses promote in students democratic attitudes and values,
1

Grammar school is an academically oriented secondary school also referred to as gymnasium, after
German secondary schools of this type (translator’s note).

33

respect for human rights, understanding and acceptance of others and those
who are different. An elective course the History of Religion has been
designed for primary school and grammar school. Curricula for compulsory
courses intended to give the students permanent and applicable knowledge
and values have been revised and improved.
Following the recommendations of the Law on Minority Rights and
Freedoms, curricula include such topics as history, art, literature, tradition
and culture of a minority or a minority ethnic group. Education institutions
and schools where the language of teaching is the official language also have
curricula that include the topics of minority languages and literature, history,
art, and culture and other content that promotes mutual tollerance and
cohabitation.
Law on Primary Education provides that a class may have maximum
30 students. By way of an exception and following the permission of the
minister of education, a class may have maximum 35 students. In addition,
the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms says that where the teaching is
provided in a minority language and script, a class can be formed for fewer
students than the number required by law for the institution concerned, with
the number being at least 50% of the number set by law. The smallest
number of students per class is set by secondary legislation of the Ministry
of Education and Sport. It says that the combined class (with students of
different grades) can be set up for minimum five students. This provision
also applies to the classes taught in a minority language and script.

ALBANIAN
Article 8 - Education
Paragraph 1
Pre-school education
sub-paragraph a) iii
Within the territory in which members of Albanian people live preschool education is available in public pre-school institutions, in accordance
with law.
Therefore, pre-school education in Albanian is available also in
Albanian, i.e. it is provided where such need is expressed or where the
parents request that pre-school education be provided in that language.

35

In 2013/2014, there were 276 children in 10 groups at this level of
education in Podgorica, Tuzi, Plav, Ulcinj.
The public pre-school “Solidarnost” in Ulcinj has 8 groups, while the
unit in Tuzi, which belongs to the public pre-school “Đina Vrbica”
Podgorica, has one group, with another one in Plav. These groups are
provided their entire education in Albanian. Their teaching staff meet the
legal requirements in terms of their qualifications and have themselves
studied in Albanian.
For the time being, there is sufficient pre-school teaching staff in
Albanian.
Primary education
sub-paragraph b) i
Systemic education legislation recognise the concept of general
constitutional guarantee on education of minorities at both the level of
general objectives and principles in education and the level of individual
provisions. In particular, the system is focused on integration of minorities
and preservation of their identity. The students from minority ethnic groups
are entitled to education in their mother tongue. The focus is on a curriculum
which includes the topics relating to mother tongue and literature, history,
art, and culture of minorities and other content that promotes mutual
tollerance and cohabitation. In addition to the content of regular course
curricula, also available for such content is 20% of curriculum which
remains open to specific content on national culture, history and art. The
teaching in Albanian is organised at all education levels, from pre-school to
higher education.In the territorial units with majority Albanian population
(Podgorica - Tuzi, Bar, Plav, Ulcinj, Rožaje), Albanian is the language of
teaching in 12 primary schools („Đerđ Kastrioti Skenderbeg”, “Džafer
Nikočević”, “Hajro Šahmanović”, “29. Novembar”, “Jedinstvo”, “Mahmut
Lekić”, “Đerđ Kastrioti Skenderbeg”, “Daciće”, “Bedri Elezaga”, “Boško
Strugar”, “Marko Nuculović”, “Maršal Tito”) for 2814 students (of which
1482 are boys, and 1332 are girls).
The Institute for Textbooks and Teaching Aids pays special
attention to the textbooks in Albanian.
Full sets of primary school textbooks in Albanians were prepared for
2013/2014.
Under Article 18, para. 2, Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, in
addition to the statutory requirements set for the post of a school principal
set under the General Law on Education, the pricipal of the school providing
36

teaching in Albanian needs to have competence in Albanian, i.e. to be able
to actively use the Albanian language and script.
The principals of all the education institutions where teaching is
provided in Albanian have an active knowledge of Albanian. Where
teaching is in both Montenegrin and Albanian, most principals have active
knowledge of Albanian. However, in a number of schools where the
teaching is predominantly in Montenegrin, the principals were not required
to meet this additional criterion.
When electing principals for the schools where teaching is conducted
in Albanian, the Ministry of Education must obtain prior opinion from the
Albanian National Council of Montenegro, as set by Article 18 of the Law
on Minority Rights and Freedoms.
Secondary education
sub-paragraph c) ii
Secondary education in Albanian is provided in four secondary
schools (in Ulcinj, where there are two secondary schools, one of which is a
private grammar school, and one each in Tuzi and Plav). This school year,
2013/14, 1300 students have attended secondary schools that provide
teaching in Albanian (grammar school and vocational schools), but also
secondary mixed schools "Bećo Bašić" i "Bratstvo jedinstvo", and grammar
schools "25. maj" and "Drita". The Institute for Textbooks and Teaching
Aids provided all the grammar school textbooks for the teaching in
Albanian.
Technical and vocational education
sub-paragraph d) i
Vocational education in Albanian is available in PI2 Secondary mixed
School ’’Bećo Bašić‘’ in Plav and PI Secondary mixed school ‘’Bratstvo
jedinstvo’’ in Ulcinj.
In the above schools, students may take Albanian Language and
Literature as an optional course.
Following the recommendation of the Ministry of Education, the
teaching of vocational and theoretical courses in vocational education makes
use of textbooks in Albanian issued in the region provided their content is
compatible with the content of the courses here.
2

PI stands for public institution (translator’s note).

37

The Centre for Vocational Education has already called a tender for
the translation into Albanian of the student’s and teacher’s book for the
course in “Young Entrepreneurs”.
University and higher education
sub-paragraph e) ii
Please note that the First Report erroneously stated that the
Department for Albanian and Literature had been opened. A study
programme was established instead within the University of Montenegro,
named Teacher Training in Albanian. It is a four-year academic programme
implemented as an independent study programme in Podgorica.
The programme started in 2004/2005, when 49 students were
enrolled. In the academic 2011/12, 14 students enrolled, in 2012/13, 17
students enrolled, while in 2013/14, 12 students were enrolled. A total
number of students for all years is 74. So far, 49 students have graduated. At
this department, 80% of teaching is in Albanian and 20% in Montenegrin.
As for its teaching staff, 25 are professors, mainly engaged on a
contract basis, and 7 are teaching assistants.
In order to promote full enjoyment of minority rights, the University
of Montenegro, following a request of the Albanian Council in Montenegro,
may enroll a number of students, members of minorities, every year, in
accordance with the University internal regulations.
Adult and continuing education
sub-paragraph f )
Adult education is an integral part of Montenegro’s education system.
Under the General Law on Education, the Ministry of Education and Sports
is responsible for issuance of licences to the institutions that meet the
statutory requirements for the implementation of accredited programmes for
adult education. Such a licence has so far been issued to the PI Secondary
mixed school “Bratstvo-jedinstvo” in Ulcinj, that provides teaching in
Albanian, while the licence procedure for the Primary school “Boško
Strugar” from Ulcinj is still underway.
Teaching of history and culture
sub-paragraph g)

38

All textbooks for primary and secondary general education (grammar
school) used for the teaching in Montenegrin have been translated into
Albanian, while there is a separate textbook for the course in Albanian and
Literature.
The curricula designed for schools where the teaching is in
Montenegrin include topics that cover minority language, literatures, history,
art, and culture and other content that promotes mutual tollerance and
cohabitation. The primary reader in Montenegrin, for example, covers the
works of notable Albanian writers. Other textbooks follow a similar
principle.
Thanks to the teacher autonomy concept and the possibility for them
to create and adjust some 20% of the teaching content to the needs and
interest of their students, the number of units on the culture and history of
Albanian people can be bigger than the number of such units in the
translated textbook.
The new reformed curricula relevant to the teaching of the minorities
(mother tongue, history, art, etc) have already greatly integrated content that
promotes history and culture of the minorities in Montenegro. The measures
that should ensure the teaching of history and culture have already been
implemented as part of the new curricula for mother tongue, history and
culture prepared for both primary and secondary education. The new
textbooks in Albanian have been published.
Basic and further teacher training
sub-paragraph h)
Between the two reports, the schools providing teaching in Albanian, in
accordance with the curricula, have been visited by the Education Bureau as
part of their regular quality assurance procedures.
Beside the Education Bureau, professional development of teachers is
also arranged by the Centre for Vocational Education for teachers of
vocational, theoretical, and practical courses. These institutions have
sufficient expert staff dealing with professional development of teachers.
Professional development needs are also addressed through foreign projects.
Education Bureau, Sector for Teacher Professional Development, issues the
Catalogue of teacher continuing professional development, where it offers a
number of programmes that address interculturality either wholly or through
individual themes:

39

a)

b)

c)

Intercultural education in primary and grammar school offers such
topics as: What is culture: impact of education on the development of
cultural values; Multiculturality, interculturality, respect for diversity;
Awareness raising of ourselves and others; Intercultural learning

40

Humanitarian Law (OSCE, Podgorica office) (15 participants in 1 seminar);
Education for Social Justice - against stereotypes and prejudice (intended for
adults) (32 participants in 1 seminar); Education for Social Justice curriculum: 32 participants in 1 seminar.
The Ministry of Education, through its National Commission for
UNESCO, implemented the project “Interactive services for early and preschool education” targetting children living in rural areas. The three
municipalities selected for these interactive services are Danilovgrad, Berane
and Rožaje, because a significant number of rural communities gravitate
around them, and because they are multi-cultural, multi-confessional, and
multi-ethnic. The trained teachers promote programmes and activities
relating to learning and child development by way of home visits and
activities at the local facility.
The SIMPLE project is implemented in schools to promote equal
opportunities for education irrespective of one’s education, ethnic or any
other difference. For reason of their cultural, national, linguistic and
religious diversity, the following primary schools are covered: „21. maj“ and
„Savo Pejanović“, Podgorica, „Mileva Lajović Lalatović“, Nikšić, „Maršal
Tito“, Ulcinj, „Drago Milović“, Tivat, „Milan Vuković“, Herceg Novi,
„Hajro Šahmanović“, „Džafer Nikočević“, Plav, Gusinje, and „Radomir
Mitrović, Berane. The school activities are lead by school services that
organised intercultural workshops together with their students. Posters on
equality were created and posted in visible places at school. The day of
interculturality was celebrated this year (29 January 2014) to show that
diversity is wealth. An event was organised on this ocassion at „21. maj”
primary school in Podgorica, where the students taking part in the campaign
“Be the other one” showed their sensitivity and knowledge on this topic, first
in a quiz and then by visual art performance.
The Council of Europe and European Union project “Regional
support to inclusive education” is intended to improve social inclusion and
cohesion in the broadest possible sense. The following seven elementary and
primary schools have been selected: „Vuk Karadžić“ primary school,
Podgorica; „Mileva Lajović - Lalatović“ primary school, Nikšić; „Mustafa
Pećanin“ primary school, Rožaje; Secondary mixed school "Bećo Bašić"
Plav; Secondary mixed school "Ivan Goran Kovačić" Herceg Novi;
Grammar School "Tanasije Pejatović" Pljevlja, and Secondary vocational
school "Sergije Stanić" Podgorica, where diversity among students is
promoted.
There are no special teacher training programmes in Albanian and so
the training is conducted using the teacher training programmes designed for
41

the teaching in Montenegrin. However, the Education Bureau has a team of
teacher trainers who can do the training also in Albanian.
ROMANI LANGUAGE
Article 8 – Education
By ratifying the European Charter on Regional and Minority
Languages, the Montenegrin Government has recognised the Romani
language as a distinct minority language, but it has not included it in the
curriculum. That is to say that Romani, as a minority language is not
taught as a mother tongue in education institutions because it has not
been standardised and because there is no qualified teaching staff to
teach in Romani. In addition, according to data from the 2011 census,
the Roma account for 1.01% of the Montenegrin population.
The Montenegrin Government provides free textbooks to Roma
pupils in the early years of the primary school, while the Ministry of
Human and Minority Rights provides bursaries to Roma students in the
secondary school and at the Universities.
In 2013, as in the previous years, funding (EUR 75,000) was
secured for the bursaries for all Roma secondary school and university
students. The bursary programme is implemented by the Institute for
Social Inclusion. In 2013, bursaries were granted to 14 university and
75 secondary school students.
Paragraph 1
Preschool education
item a) iv
Working with children from Roma and Egyptian (RE)
backgrounds consists of focusing on their integration and on improving
their educational and social attainment. Inclusion programmes for
children from a R/E background are continuously implemented at all
educational levels. In 2013, the most important activities were: the fulltime preschool teaching programme (224 children from a RE
background) and the half-day child care programme (on average, 80
children from a RE background).

42

Independent preparatory kindergartens for children from Roma
and Egyptian backgrounds were independently established in 2013 for
87 preschool children who became entitled to enrol for primary school
in the 2013/14 school year but had not previously attended any
organised education. The following kindergartens were involved: “Đina
Vrbica“ from Podgorica, “Dragan Kovačević“ from Nikšić, “Radmila
Nedić“ from Berane, “Bambi“ from Tivat and “Naša radost“ from Herceg
Novi. The Bureau for Education has organised the training and
supported the RE mediators. Under the Law on Preschool Education ,
teaching takes place six to 12 hours a day (it used to be 10 under the
previous law), which enables parents to fit preschool around their
working hours. The “Support to integration and voluntary return of
internally displaced inhabitants of Konik camp in Montenegro“
programme is being implemented with the support of the Delegation of
European Union in Montenegro and the Government of Montenegro in
the partnership with the German organisation - HELP. The REF (Roma
Education Fund) is implementing the education component of this
programme in the partnership with the Ministry of Education. The
programmed child development and literacy programme for adults aim
to improve the access to education and development during early
childhood for the children from RE background. About 50 workshops
have been held, since the beginning of the project, with two groups of
mothers (twice a week) with the aim to optimise the early development
and literacy of children.
Pursuant to the Law on Preschool Education, the costs of food in
the institution for the children from the most vulnerable groups of
population are paid by the Centre for Social Work depending on the
territory where the children, i.e. the parents reside. The children from
the most vulnerable groups of population are: children with
developmental disabilities, and children having difficulties caused by
social, language and cultural barriers.
A preparation programme for enrolment in the primary school
and preschool institutions, and the programme of psychological and
social support for preschool students have been envisaged within
”Inclusion of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians in city schools“ project. The
activities that will be implemented are as follows:
- development of short preparation programme for starting school
for children aged 5-6 years, that ensures education activities one year
before they start primary school;
43

- training of staff for the implementation of short programme,
- implementation of programme in public kindergarten „Đina Vrbica“;
-development of programme for psychological and social support and
its implementation.
Primary education
item b) iv
A great deal of effort has been made in order to provide good
quality primary education for children from Konik 1 and Konik 2 camps.
Since 2008/09 school year the activities for inclusion of these children
in the city primary schools have been implemented. In 2013/14 school
year, the so called Desegregate education of Roma children from Konik
1 and Konik 2 camps is being implemented in 6 primary schools in
Podgorica: “Božidar Vuković Podgoričanin”, “Marko Miljanov”, “21. maj”,
“Savo Pejanović”, “Vladimir Nazor” and “Vuk Karadžić”. The activities
represent the introduction into gradual closing down of a district unit of
“Božidar Vuković Podgoričanin” school. This school has been given two
shuttle buses for transportation of children (140 children) to the city
schools. Six Roma mediators are daily looking after the children to make
sure they go to the classes regularly and cooperate with the teachers
and professional associates from the schools in order to help them get
good grades. The volunteers (72 students) of Faculty of Phylosophy in
Nikšić are helping in overcoming the language barriers and to improve
the school grades for 220 children that attend the regional unit of
“Božidar Vuković Podgoričanin“ school and 120 children that attend the
city schools.
In order to increase the number of children from internally
displaced persons from RAE population, the following activities are
implemented and provided: an information campaign on necessity of
preschool education and activities related to provision of school
material, transportation of children to the city schools, snacks for
children that attend the city schools, as well as for children from the
children’s playroom in camps. Furthermore, there is an ongoing project
– Support for the social inclusion process, and the goal is to ensure the
inclusion of vulnerable, socially excluded groups, through the social care
services and education system. The Amendatory General Law on
Education is adopted by the Parliament of Montenegro, and is in force
since 15th August 2013. These amendments enable the persons with
44

the status of foreigner with a permanent residence, to work as teachers
in the education institutions in Montenegro.
In Inclusive education services project (IPA 2010) there has been
work on prevention of school dropouts through mechanism of detection
and case management in 8 schools (4 in Podgorica, 2 in Nikšić, one in
Tivat and one in Berane). The job description for RE mediators has been
done, 7 training courses held for 168 school directors, teachers,
professional associates, a manual for professionals has been done (for
teachers, professional associates, directors, Roma assistants) and for
those interested in prevention of school dropouts. The Roma mediators
are involved in the following primary schools: "Božidar Vuković
Podgoričanin", "21.maj", "Savo Pejavić", "Vladimir Nazor", "Vuk
Karađžić", "Marko Miljanov", and "Drago Malović” in Tivat. The
commission is monitoring the dropout of Roma and Egyptian children
(representatives of the line ministries, Red Cross of Montenegro and the
NGO sector are also involved).
The number of Roma children in education system is increasing
every year. The data show that there is a positive trend when it comes
to primary education of Roma children. For example, in 2001/02 school
year, 536 students have been enrolled, whilst in 2013/14 school year
that number increased to 1853 students.
Within activities for the social inclusion of Roma into Montenegrin
society, the Ministry for Human and Minority Rights has provided for 15
Roma and Egyptian children, the best students from Podgorica, Nikšić
and Herceg Novi to stay at the Resort in Ivanova Korita. The Ministry
has also organised a free seven day holiday for the primary school
students, of Roma and Egyptian background. Twenty five of the best
Roma and Egyptian students from VII, VIII and IX grades of primary
schools from Berane, Bijelo Polje, Nikšić and Podgorica were in the
period between 19th and 26th July 2013 at the children’s resort
“Lovćen” in Budva. The Ministry for Human and Minority Rights
provided funds for procurement of free textbooks for students of I, II
and III grade of primary school (EUR 54.349). The programme is
implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, and the
textbooks are distributed via the schools.
The Ministry of Education in coordination with the Bureau for
Educational Services, through the education of teaching staff is creating
favourable environment and conditions for integration and socialisation
of Roma children.
45

Secondary education
item c) iv
For the enrolled secondary school students of Roma background
(81) free textbooks and scholarships are provided, and there is ongoing
preparation of mentorship programme in which the assigned teachers
will provide additional support. The Ministry is suggesting to the
schools to enable interested Roma to sit deferred exams, free of charge,
and according to the principle of affirmative action, the Ministry
intercedes for enrolment in vocational schools (total 15 vocational
schools). The same measure is implemented in cooperation with the
higher education institutions.
The Bureau for Education is working on professional development
and training of teachers. A number of programmes is being offered that,
as a whole or through certain topics related to integration of Roma
children. The following trainings were held: Inclusion of Roma children
in preschool education: number of participants - 19 (one seminar);
seminar: Education for social justice ‒ against stereotypes and prejudice
(Roma Education Fund) for 32 participants, and Education for social
justice – curriculum (Roma Education Fund) also one seminar for 32
participants.
Also in 2013 the funds (EUR 75,000) were provided for
scholarships of all Roma high school and university students. The
scholarship programme is being implemented by the Institute for Social
Inclusion, and in 2013, 15 university students and 81 highs school
students received scholarships.
The Ministry for Human and Minority Rights has provided the
funds (EUR 54.349) for procurement of free textbooks for students of I,
II and III grade of the primary school. The programme is being
implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, and the
textbooks are being distributed by the schools. The students of Roma
and Egyptian population are enrolled into secondary schools in which
the teaching is conducted in Montenegrin and other languages in the
official use, and in most of the cases according to the principle of
affirmative action. In 2012/2013 school year the number of enrolled
secondary school students was 75 and there were 9 university students,
whilst this year (2013/14) we have 81 secondary school students.

46

Technical and vocational education
item d) iv
In the first half of 2013 the Centre for Vocational Education
organised and held the event - XII Days of adult education and learning,
from 27th May to 5th June 2013, and within this event three round tables
were organized on the topic: “Importance of education for personal,
economic and social development“ in Podgorica, Mojkovac and Budva.
The goal of round tables was to introduce the participants to the role
that adult education and learning have for the personal, economic and
social development, and particularly with its role in achieving gender
equality and reduction of poverty. It has been pointed out that systemic
planning of human resources development and investment in their
education and training is not spending but investment for the future.
The Centre for Vocational Education in cooperation with the
Institute for Social Inclusion has prepared the occupational standards
for expert associate in social inclusion of Roma and Egyptians, and

The adults may be educated according to the publicly valid
curriculum for primary, general secondary and vocational education,
adapted to the education or part of education, as well as in accordance
with adult education programmes, pursuant to the Law on Adult
Education. Adult participants of education courses are exempt from
paying cost for primary education as well as for the acquiring of first
qualification.
The Literacy programme and Primary school programme for
adults are implemented by the schools and adult education providers
licensed to work by the Ministry of Education and Sport.
Furthermore, the National Employment Agency is organising
programmes for acquiring key skills for adult Roma people.
Within the “Inclusion of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians in City
Schools“ project it is envisaged to implement the workshops and focus
groups with the parents on strengthening motivation for continuation of
education; teaching of Montenegrin language for parents was also
organised.
History and culture teaching
item g)
In accordance with the Law on Minority Rights and Freedoms, the
subject programmes comprise topics from the field of history, art,
literature, tradition, and culture of a minority. The curriculum in
institutions and schools that teach in Montenegrin language
encompasses topics from the mother language and literature, history,
art, and other cultures of minorities and other topics that encourage
mutual tolerance and coexistence. With the aim of continuation of
system activities in the field of social integration, last year in April, the
Government adopted its new strategic document for the period 20122016.
The Strategy represents the set of specific measures and activities
in the four year period, of legal, political, economic, social, urban and
communal, education, health, cultural and informative, and any other
necessary character. The Strategy that is in accordance with the
guidelines for National Roma Integration strategies EU 2020, defines the
implementers, deadlines and financial costs, as well as the manner of
monitoring of the project implementation and obligations of one year
reporting to the Government of Montenegro.

As it is already know, in June last year Montenegro assumed the
presidency of Roma Inclusion Decade 2005-2015. In addition to the
basic ideas of Montenegrin presidency of the Decade, i.e. the topics of
education, residence, health protection, employment, Montenegro has
chosen to deal also with the horizontal topics: antidiscrimination/i.e.
human rights, gender equality and reduction of poverty.
The Ministry for Human and Minority Rights has provided for the
translation and printing of publication that comprises three important
international documents: “UN Declaration on the rights of persons
belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities”,
Council of Europe “Framework Convention for the Protection of
National Minorities” and “European Charter on Regional or Minority
Languages”. The publication is printed in Montenegrin, English,
Albanian and Romani language.
Basic and continuous teacher training
item h )
Professional development and individual improvement of
professional and teaching staff, as well as the improvement of quality
and efficiency of education system is the responsibility of Department
for Continuous and Professional Development of the Bureau for
Educational Services. Training programmes for professional
development of the employees in education sector are accredited by the
Commission of Bureau for Educational Services, and confirmed by the
Ministry of Education and Sport. The Bureau for Educational Services is
choosing the programmes via the public competition and enlists them in
the Catalogue of programmes for teacher training. In the Catalogue of
programmes for 2010/2011 school year the following programmes are
offered: ”Integration of Roma Children in Primary Schools - support to
inclusion” and ”Kindergarten as a Family Centre for Roma Children –
support to inclusion”.
In ”Inclusion of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians in City Schools“
project, a teacher training will be implemented according to different
modules, in compliance with the rules of practical experience and
specific examples. The emphasis is placed on the inclusion of Roma,
prevention of violence, etc. Through the teacher training course it is also
necessary to improve the skills for overcoming conflicts, building up
Individual development and education programme (IDEP), cooperation
51

with the parents, etc. The training courses will also comprise topics such
as: Roma history, origin, tradition, economic and social status, rites, and
religion with the aim to improve cooperation and communication with
the parents.

Having in mind the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 1 of the
Charter, that are related to the court authority and that pursuant to the
Law on Ratification are applied to Albanian and Romani language, we
emphasise the following:
The provision of Article 7 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure
Code stipulates that in the Courts having jurisdiction over the territory
in which the majority or a substantial number of inhabitants consists of
the members of national minorities, their respective languages and
alphabets shall be in the official use in criminal proceedings in
accordance with law. Furthermore, the Article 8, paragraph 2 of the
Criminal Procedure Code stipulates that parties, witnesses and other
participants in the proceedings shall have the right to use their own
language. If the proceedings are conducted in the language those
persons do not understand, provision shall be made for an
interpretation of statements and the translation of documents and other
written evidence. The person referred to in Paragraph 2 of this Article
shall be instructed on his right to interpretation, and he may waive such
right if he understands the language in which the proceedings are being
conducted (Article 8, paragraph 3 of Criminal Procedure Code). If the
language of a national minority is also in the official use in the Court, the
Court shall issue summons, decisions and other papers in that language
to the persons belonging to respective national minority if they have
used that language in the course of the proceedings (Article 9 paragraph
4 of Criminal Procedure Code).
The provision in Article 17, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure
Code is very important, as it defines the legally invalid evidence,
according to which the court decision cannot be based on the evidence
that were obtained by violations of human rights and basic freedoms
guaranteed by the Constitution or confirmed by the international
agreements, or based on evidence that were obtained by violations of
provisions of criminal proceedings, as well as on other evidence
resulting from them, nor such evidence may be used in the proceedings.
It is obvious that this provision refers also to the evidence obtained in
contradiction with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code that
define the use of language in the criminal proceedings. Another
important provision is that from the Article 226, paragraph 6 of CPC,
according to which the expenses of translation into languages which are
not in the official use in the Court, and which are incurred in enforcing
the provisions of the present Code related to the rights of parties,
53

witnesses and other persons participating in the proceedings to use
their own language, shall not be collected from the persons who are
pursuant to the provisions of the present Code required to compensate
the costs of the criminal proceedings.
Also the Law on Civil Procedure (LCP) contains provisions that
define the use of language in that procedure. The provision from Article
7, paragraph 1 of LCP stipulates that civil procedure is conducted in the
language that is in the official use in the court. The parties and other
participants in the procedure that do not understand or do not speak
the language that is in the official use in the court shall have the right to
use their own language or the language they understand. Article 99 of
the LCP stipulates that parties and other participants in the procedure
are entitled to use their own language or the language that they can
understand before the court (paragraph 1), if the procedure is not
conducted in the language of the party, or other participants in the
procedure they will be provided, at their request, interpretation into
their language or the language they understand, and the translation of
all pleadings and written evidence and interpretation of what is being
said at the hearing (paragraph 2), the parties and other participants in
the procedure shall be instructed about the right to follow up the
procedure before the court in their own language with assistance of
interpreter (paragraph 3). Furthermore, the provision of Article 100,
paragraph 1 of LCP stipulates that all the summons, decisions and other
court writs shall be delivered to the parties and other participants in the
procedure in the language which is in the official use in court. If any of
the languages of national minorities is in official use in the court, the
court shall deliver court writs in that language to those parties and
participants in the procedure that belong to that national minority and
use that language in the procedure (Article 100, paragraph 2 of LCP).
The provision referred to in Article 101, paragraph 1 of LCP defines that
parties and other participants in the procedure shall submit complaints,
appeals and other pleadings to the court in the language that is in
official use in the court. Parties and other participants in the procedure
may also submit their pleadings to the court in language of national
minorities which is not in official use in the court if that is in conformity
with the Law (Article 101, paragraph 2 of LCP). Particularly important is
the provision of the Article 102 of LCP, according to that provision the
costs of translation into the language of national minorities arising from
the application of the provisions of Constitution and this Law on the
54

right of national minorities to use their own language shall be charged
to the court funds. This provision ensures that members of national
minorities shall not give up on the use of their own language in the court
procedure in order to avoid the paying of translation costs, which also
insures the right to free access to court and fair trial.
On the basis of analysis of the quoted provisions of the CPC and
LCP and their links with the provisions of Article 9 of the European
Charter on Regional or Minority Languages, and with reference to the
Article 3 of the Law on Ratification, it may be concluded that provisions
of our procedural law are in compliance with the Article 9 of the
Charter.
In the procedure before Administrative Court regarding the rights
to use own language, the provisions of the Law on Civil Procedure are
applied accordingly. The Law on Administrative Procedure (“Official
Gazette of MNE“, No. 60/2003) in the Article 55 defines that on the
matters of procedure in the Administrative dispute, that are not defined
by that law, the provisions of the Law on Civil Procedure shall be
applied.
In all the courts in which the Charter is applied for Albanian and
Romani language, there is a Service for free legal aid, where free legal
aid is provided by the attorneys at the expense of the Budget, and where
for the most part the users are members of Roma population, having in
mind their poor financial condition, thats ensures the free access of this
population to the court and the right to fair trial in the procedures in
which they take part.
If in the procedure before the court, the parties, witnesses or
other persons taking part in the procedure use regional or minority
languages, the court shall previously inform them with the possibility to
use their mother language and to have translations of their statements,
documents or other written evidence by the interpreter at the expense
of the Budget. Furthermore, the parties in the procedure may submit all
the evidence that they made in their own language with the
corresponding translation of authorised interpreters, which in the
process have the same probative force as the local documents.
The Ministry of Justice of Montenegro has appointed in total 39
persons as interpreters – translators for Albanian language, which is
according to the opinion of courts in places where Albanians account for
significant part of the population is sufficient for full application of
Article 9 of the Charter.
55

In addition to all the created assumptions, and adherence to the
Charter, it rarely happens that a party requests to use its mother
language; hence there were no such cases before the Administrative
Court and the Basic Court in Plav.
In the Basic Court in Ulcinj in one of the court rooms the
equipment for audio and visual recording and simultaneous
interpretation has been installed, and with that the technical conditions
have been created for consistent application of obligations of the Court
that result from the Article 9 of the European Charter on Regional or
Minority Languages.
In the Secretariat of the Judicial Council – in the Department for
information and communication technologies and multimedia, there is
one employee of Albanian nationality, and that contributes to the
quality of application of Article 9 of the Charter.
Having in mind the fact that the judicial authorities in Montenegro
are familiar with the provisions of the Charter on Regional or Minority
Languages, particularly with the provisions of the Article 9 of the
Charter that are related to the use of regional or minority languages in
the court procedure, it may be concluded that the European Charter on
Regional or Minority Languages is properly implemented before the
judicial bodies of Montenegro, with the constant strengthening of the
quality of its application. In all the courts where the Charter is applied
for Albanian and Romani language, there is a Service for free legal aid
where the free legal aid is provided by the attorneys at the expense of
the Budget, and where for the most part the users are members of Roma
population, and having in mind their poor financial condition, that
ensures the free access of this population to the court and the right to
fair trial in the procedures in which they take part.

Measures undertaken in order to implement each selected
paragraph or item
It has been prescribed that, in local self - government units, where
members of minorities are the majority or considerable part of
population according to the latest census, that minority's language shall
be in official usage as well. Official usage of the language of minorities
specifically implies: usage of the language in administrative and court
proceeding and in governing the administrative and court proceeding,
with public documents issuance and keeping official records, at the
ballot and other election material, and in the work of representative
bodies. The law, also, sets forth that, in defined territories of local self –

57

government units, names of settlements, squares and streets,
institutions, office and other companies and toponyms shall be also
written in the language and script of the minorities (Article 11).
According to the international standards, local governance does
imply one type of participation of the minorities into the public life.
Law on Local Self - Government (Official Gazette of Montenegro
42/03, 28/04, 75/05 and 13/06 and Official Gazette of Montenegro
88/09, 3/10, 73/10 and 38/12, 10/14) provides that, in performing its
activities, the local self - government bodies shall provide for the equal
protection of the rights and law – based legal interests of the local
population and legal entities, and that the municipality shall provide the
conditions for protection and enhancement of minority rights, in
accordance with the Constitution, international legal acts and separate
laws ( Article 10), whereas the Law on Capital City shall establish the
town municipalities Golubovciand Tuzi, for more efficient performance
of the activities under the competence of the Capital. Majority of
population in town municipality Tuzi is Albanians. In municipalities
with Albanians as the majority or considerable part of the population,
local self - government units, by their decisions, make more specific the
defined minority rights related to the names of settlements, streets and
municipalities being written in Albanian. Besides this, in areas with
majority Albanian population, they are entitled to use their national
symbols.
Contrary to other minority nations and minority national
communities which are incorporated into contemporary courses of
Montenegrin society, Roma and Egyptians are the most endangered and
most on the margins of the society in Montenegro. With a view to
affirming and enhancing the rights of this community, local self government units (the Capital – Podgorica, Berane, BijeloPolje, Nikšić,
Tivat) adopter their action plans containing a number of systemic
measures and activities to be implemented, in order to integrate Roma
and Egyptians in the areas of legal, political, economic – social, cultural
and informative life, holders, deadlines and necessary funds, as well as
the set of instruments for monitoring and evaluation of the impact of
undertaken measures. Implementation of the action plans aims at
contributing the improvement of the quality of life conditions for Roma
and Egyptians, and at encouraging their integration into the local
community. Municipalities undertake substantial activities in the area of
integration and improvement of the life quality of Roma and Egyptians
58

through addressing the residential needs of this community, organizing
educational and motivational workshops for RE parents on significance
and benefits of the education, employing RE into the local
administration bodies or in public institutions established by the
municipality, improving their financial position, mainly through one –
off aid programs. The Ministry of Interior, jointly with the Union of
Municipalities of Montenegro awards the best practices in certain
thematic areas, and the Municipality of Berane has so far been awarded
for the practice ‘’Improving the Roma and Egyptian integration in
Municipality of Berane’’, for 2013.

Measures undertaken in order to implement each selected
paragraph or item
From Article 11 of the Charter on Regional or Minority Languages
related to the media, Montenegro has accepted and applied paragraph 1
items: a (iii), b (ii), c (ii), d, e (i), f (ii), paragraph 2 and paragraph 3.
The right to information in one’s native language, besides the right
to education, preservation and development of the culture and the right
to official usage of the language and script shall constitute one of the
basic minority rights which are guaranteed under the Constitution of
Montenegro. The Constitution, also, guarantees the freedom of press
and other types of informing, as well as the right to establish
newspapers and other means of public informing with the entry at the
competent body. The Constitution of Montenegro provides that the
members of national and ethnic groups have the right to freely use their
language and script, the right to education and the right to information
in their native language.
Media legislation contains special provisions related to informing
the members of minority and ethnic groups in their native languages.
The Article 8 of the Law on Public Broadcasting Services of Montenegro
("Official Gazette of Montenegro" 79/08) states that ‘’Radio – Television
of Montenegro may, for the needs of certain public broadcasting
services, establish regional radio and television studios, having a special
obligation of production and broadcasting regional programs into
minority nations’ languages and other minority national communities in
that area.” The obligation of production and broadcasting different
program contents (informative, cultural, artistic, educational, scientific,
sports, children and others) has been established, without any type of
discrimination or social differentiation, in order to satisfy the interests
of the public on national and local level. Production and broadcasting of
the programs are ‘’intended for all society segments, especially taking
into consideration children and the youth, members of minorities and
other minority national communities, the disabled, socially endangered,
and other specific groups.’’ (Article 9 item 4 of the Law on Public
Broadcasting Services of Montenegro ("Official Gazette of Montenegro"
79/08)
Complying with the editors’ independence of the Radio and
Television of Montenegro has also been established, with RTCG deciding
independently on the content of its programs, terms and manner for
60

broadcasting, obeying professional standards and program rules
adopted by the RTCG Council, whereas they are obliged to inform the
public truly, comprehensively, impartially and timely on the events and
circumstances which are of public interest, to contribute to the respect
for and promotion of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms,
democratic values and institutions, idea pluralism, enhancing the
culture and public dialogue and respecting ethical standards, privacy
and dignity of the citizens.
Article 3 of the Law on Media (Official Gazette of Montenegro
51/02, 62/02) sets forth that the state shall provide for a part of the
funds for exercising the citizens’ rights to being informed without
discrimination, guaranteed under the Constitution and legislation. The
Republic shall direct the funds for broadcasting in Albanian and in
languages of other national and ethnic groups, in order to exercise the
said rights under the Constitution. A group of laws on media regulates
the area of informing in accordance with the Constitution, and the
standards contained within international documents on human rights
and freedoms (UN, OSCE, Council of Europe, EU). The law on electronic
media defines the rights, liabilities and responsibilities of legal and
natural persons performing the activities of production and provision of
audio – visual media services (hereinafter AVM services), services of
electronic publications via electronic communication networks;
competences, status and financial sources of the Agency for electronic
media; preventing forbidden media concentrations, encouraging media
pluralism and other issues significant for the provision of AVM services,
in accordance with international conventions and standards (Article 1).
Pursuant to the Article 2 of this Law, aligning the relations in the
area of audio – visual media services is based upon the following
principles: Freedom, professionalism and independence; prohibition of
any type of censorship; balanced development of public and commercial
providers of AVM services; free and equal approach to all AVM services;
development of competition and pluralism; implementation of
international standards; objectivity, prohibition of discrimination and
transparency. Agency for electronic media is an independent regulatory
body for the area of AVM services, which performs public authorities in
accordance with this Law and act in the interest of the public. The
Agency is an independent legal entity and it is functionally independent
of any state body and of all legal and natural persons who operate in
production and broadcasting radio and television programs or
61

providing other AVM services. The founder of the Agency is the state,
whereas the rights of the founder, on behalf of the state, are exercised
by the Agency Council, in accordance with the law.
Within the area of informing the minority nations through printed
media in Montenegro, the majority is published in Albanian, with the
representation of Serbian, Croatian, Romani, and Bosnian. Printed
media are mainly financed by the resources of the Fund for Minorities,
except for the weekly magazine „KohaJavore“ (financed within
Newspaper publishing company ‘’Pobjeda’’) and the „Alav“magazine
(financed by the Center for preservation and development of minorities’
culture). The weekly magazine “KohaJavore” addressed wide range of
topics related to culture, education and science with Albanian people,
aw well as their co – existence with other peoples in Montenegro. It
published the interviews and texts of famous Albanian, Montenegrin
and international authors.
Pursuant to the legal obligations, Television of Montenegro and
Radio of Montenegro broadcast the programs devoted to the affirmation
of minority rights in Montenegro. Public service of Montenegrin radio

which regulates the manner of distribution of the funds within the Fund,
defines general criteria for distribution of funds within the Fund for
financing the projects, as well as criteria regulating the right to
participate in public bid for distribution of the funds to the projects
significant for preservation and protection of particularities related to
the minorities. The funds are distributed into:

A harmonized regional development represents one of the
economic imperatives of Montenegro.This is extremely significant from
the perspective of protection and enhancement of minority rights,
having in mind the fact that a large number of minority nations and
other minority national communities are concentrated in less developed
northern areas. The strategy for minority policy recognizes economic
development of the areas with considerable share of minority
population as an area which should be addressed more.
