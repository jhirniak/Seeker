Foreword

In a letter dated 4 December 2001, ref. BW2001/U98451, the Ministry of the Interior and
Kingdom Relations instructed the Fryske Akademy to prepare the second periodical report as
described in Article 15 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, with
particular reference to the Frisian language.
In the above- mentioned article, the European Charter provides: ‘The Parties shall present
periodically to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, in a form to be prescribed by
the Committee of Ministers, a report on their policy pursued in accordance with Part II of this
Charter and on the measures taken in application of those provisions of Part III which they
have accepted. The first report shall be presented within the year following the entry into
force of the Charter with respect to the Party concerned, the other reports at three-yearly
intervals after the first report.’
The structure of the second report follows the Outline for three-yearly periodical reports to
be submitted by contracting parties, as adopted by the Committee of Ministers. 1 In doing so,
where possible and relevant, it also adheres to the structure of the first report. 2 In addition, the
second report frequently refers to the report of the Committee of Experts of the Council of
Europe on the application of the European Charter in the Netherlands of 2001 and the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), as adopted by the State of the
Netherlands and the provincial authority of Fryslân. 3
The second report was prepared and compiled for the Fryske Akademy by Dr Piet
Hemminga, an expert on public administration, and Ms Sytske de Jong, research assistant.
Responsible editor for this report is Auke van der Goot, senior adviser at the Dutch Ministry
of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.

Introduction

2.1

On 2 May 1996, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands officially
notified the Council of Europe that the Netherlands had accepted the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ETS 148), following the adoption of a
bill to this effect by the House of Representatives and the Senate of the States
General, on 19 October 1995 and 23 January 1996 respectively (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1996, 136). In doing so, the Netherlands became the fourth member state of
the Council of Europe to accept or ratify the Charter. 4

2.2

The Charter entered into force on 1 March 1998, following its acceptance, ratification
or approval by at least five member states of the Council of Europe, in accordance
with the provisions of Article 19. Every member state of the Council of Europe that
binds itself to the Charter undertakes to apply as a minimum the provisions contained
in Part II of the Charter, unless it has made one or more reservations, as referred to in
Article 21(1). In addition, a member state may undertake to apply certain provisions
from Part III of the Charter, in accordance with Article 2(2).

2.3

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 5 November 1992 was
concluded in English and French. The Government of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands published both texts in Dutch Treaty Series 1993, 1. A Dutch translation
of the Charter was published in Dutch Treaty Series 1993, 199. Dutch Treaty Series
1998, 20(C) is also relevant to the Dutch translation.

2.4

On accepting the Charter in 1996, the Netherlands undertook to apply the provisions
contained in Part II of the Charter to the fo llowing regional or minority languages
spoken within its territory:
-

Frisian
the Lower Saxon languages
Yiddish
the Roma languages.

The provisions of the Charter entered into force for the Kingdom of the Netherlands
on 1 March 1998. As far as the Kingdom of the Netherlands is concerned, the Charter
applies only to the Netherlands (cf Dutch Treaty Series 1998, 20).
2.5

4

On 19 March 1997, the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands submitted an
additional declaration to the Council of Europe concerning the official recognition of
Limburger as a regional language within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Charter. In
doing so, the Netherlands has also undertaken to apply the principles contained in Part
II of the Charter in relation to Limburge r (cf Dutch Treaty Series 1998, 20).

The Charter was previously accepted and/or ratified by Finland (9 November 1994), Hungary (26 April 1995)
and Norway (10 November 1993). After the Netherlands, the Charter was accepted and/or ratified by Austria (28
June 2001), Croatia (5 November 1997), Denmark (8 September 2000), Germany (16 September 1998),
Liechtenstein (18 November 1997), Slovenia (4 October 2000), Spain (9 April 2001), the United Kingdom (27
March 2001), Sweden (9 February 2000) and Switzerland (23 December 1997) (state of affairs at the end of
December 2001).

2.6

In respect of the Frisian language in the province of Fryslân, 5 the Netherlands has also
undertaken to apply a minimum of thirty-five paragraphs or sub-paragraphs chosen
from among the provisions of Part III of the Charter, including at least three chosen
from each of the Articles 8 (Education) and 12 (Cultural activities and facilities), and
at least one provision from each of the Articles 9 (Judicial authorities), 10
(Administrative authorities and public services), 11 (Media) and 13 (Economic and
social life), in accordance with Article 2(2) of the Charter.

2.7

On accepting the Charter, the Netherlands undertook to apply forty-eight provisions in
respect of the Frisian language, in accordance with the above- mentioned
classification. The choice of these provisions was influenced by the prevailing
government policy on Frisian language and culture. The following provisions were
chosen (cf Dutch Treaty Series 1998, 20):

2.8

In 1999, with a view to the periodic report, as prescribed in Article 15 of the Charter,
the Fryske Akademy prepared an initial inventory of the measures adopted by the
Netherlands in application of the provisions it had accepted from Part III of the
Charter in relation to the Frisian language, at the request of the Ministry of the Interior
and Kingdom Relations. 6 The present report may be classified as a periodical followup report, in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter.

2.9

In response to this initial inventory, the Committee of Experts, as referred to in Article
16(3) of the Charter, visited the Netherlands in February 2000 to ascertain the views
of the civil-society organisations involved in promoting the Frisian language. On the
basis of the inventory and its working visit, the Committee published its findings and
recommendations at the beginning of 2001. 7

2.10

On 19 September 2001, at its 765th meeting, the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe took note of the Committee of Expert’s report. The Committee of
Ministers formulated a number of recommendations that were incorporated into the
Committee of Expert’s report as an annexe. In addition, the Committee of Ministers
decided to make the report public. The report and the recommendations can be
consulted on the Council of Europe’s website on local and regional democracy, at
www.coe.int/local. The recommendations are discussed in depth in section 4.5 of this
report.

2.11

On 6 February 2002, the Committee of Ministers adopted the outline for the threeyearly reports, as described in Article 15(1) of the Charter, which had been approved
three years earlier, with a few changes. 8

2.12

In accordance with the Committee of Ministers’ outline, the introduction of this report
(chapter 3) provides a certain amount of background information, including historical
developments, the demographic situation, economic developments, administrative
arrangements and key policy developments. It subsequently focuses on the sociolinguistic aspects of the Frisian language, before concluding with some recent, general
government statements concerning the protection of regional or minority languages.

2.13

Part I of this report (chapter 4) provides an overview of legislation relating to the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. In
addition, it lists the organisations involved in protecting and promoting the Frisian
language and cites the measures adopted to publicise the rights and duties arising
from the application of the European Charter. Finally, it discusses the
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.

2.14

Part II of this report (chapter 5) discusses the measures adopted by the Netherlands
with regard to the Frisian language in relation to Article 7 of the European Charter.

2.15

Part III of this report (chapters 6-12) provides an overview of measures adopted by
the Netherlands to promote the use of the Frisian language in public life, in
accordance with the undertakings entered into under Article 2(2) of the European
Charter:
- Education
chapter 6
- Judicial authorities
chapter 7
- Administrative authorities and public services
chapter 8
- Media
chapter 9
- Cultural activities and facilities
chapter 10
- Economic and social life
chapter 11
- Transfrontier exchanges
chapter 12
The seven chapters in Part III follow a fixed pattern. Each chapter begins with a
general section focusing on policy developments, including legislation, in the relevant
field. In addition, each chapter presents the general recommendations that appeared in
the report of the Committee of Experts in response to the first Dutch report. On an
article-by-article basis, each chapter then considers the undertakings entered into by
the Netherlands, the opinions issued by the Committee of Experts and the
arrangements adopted by central government and the province of Fryslân in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) in the area in question, and an
accurate description of the situation. Finally, each chapter concludes with a brief
synopsis.
This report also includes eight annexes. Annexe 1 provides an overview of existing
legislation relating to the implementation of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages. In doing so, it distinguishes between the legislation of central
government, bye-laws and regulations issued by the province of Fryslân and bye-laws
issued by the municipal authorities of Fryslân.
Annexe 2 provides an overview of positions adopted by the Dutch government in
relation to the Frisian language.

8

Annexe 3 provides an overview of European and international agreements relevant to
the Frisian language.
Annexe 4 lists reports and policy documents on the Frisian language issued during the
past three years.
Annexe 5 provides an overview of bodies and organisations that were requested to
provide additional information, as well as institutions that were consulted in greater
depth.
Annexe 6 provides an overview of legally established institutions and organisations
for the protection and development of the Frisian language that are located in the
Netherlands.
Annexe 7 lists the abbreviations used in this report.
Annexe 8, finally, provides an overview of grants related to the Frisian language that
were awarded by the Literary Fund between 1999 and 2001.
2.16

In order to implement measures promoting Frisian language and culture, central
government and the provincial authority of Fryslân adopted a Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture in 2001 for the third time in succession. 9 Where relevant, the
present report refers to the provisions of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001), as concluded and signed in The Hague on 5 June 2001. The third
Covenant follows the European Charter in the sense that the articles of the Charter
that apply to the Frisian language form the basis of the Covenant. On presenting the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) to the House of Representatives
of the States General, the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations
indicated that it remains to be seen whether certain aspects of the Covenant require
adjustment in the light of the present report. 10 In any event, an official interministerial
committee will be established to prepare the report on the implementation of the 2001
Covenant. 11 This committee will include officials from the province of Fryslân.

2.17

This report deals with the state of affairs on 1 March 2002, which is exactly four years
after the entry into force of the Charter in the Netherlands. In a few cases, where
possible and relevant to Frisian language policy, documents that appeared after this
reference date have also been used.
At the end of each chapter, this report provides a brief summary of Dutch policy
initiatives in the light of the commitments undertaken by the Netherlands under the
Charter.

Preliminary Section

3.1

Background
The outline for the three-yearly reports states that the preliminary section should
provide a certain amount of background information. In this regard, the outline
suggests that attention should first be devoted to the relevant historical developments,
the demographic situation in relation to the economic data for the region in question,
and the administrative organisation of the state (see sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5).
Secondly, the outline requests the contracting parties to list all regional or minority
languages, including non-territorial languages, as defined in Article 1(a) of the
Charter, and to indicate the region where the speakers of such languages reside, the
number of speakers and the criteria used to define a speaker of a regional or minority
language (see section 3.6).
Thirdly, the outline requests the contracting parties to indicate the number of speakers
of each regional or minority language (see section 3.6).
Finally, the outline requests the contracting parties to devote attention to recent,
general statements on government policy concerning the protection of regional or
minority languages, in so far as this forms a useful addition to the above- mentioned
information (see section 3.7).

3.2

Historical developments

3.2.1

The first historical reference to the Frisian people dates from the time that the Romans
came into contact with them. The beginnings of Frisian writing can be traced back to
approximately 1200. At the end of the sixteenth century, Middle Dutch superseded
Old Frisian as a written language, partly because of the rise of a new central authority.
As a spoken language, however, Frisian has continued to fulfil its purpose, especially
in the countryside. 12 The fact that Frisian managed to survive as a written language
without ever enjoying the status of an official language is largely, if not exclusively,
attributable to the works of the Frisian Renaissance poet Gysbert Japicx (1603-1666),
whose three-volume ‘Friesche Rymlerye’ was published posthumously in 1668. 13

3.2.2

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, an independent literary scene and national
consciousness blossomed in Fryslân as in many other European countries. Three
brothers by the name of Halbertsma were the first to encourage the wider public to
start reading Frisian. The establishment of the Friesch Genootschap van Geschied-,
Oudheid- en Taalkunde (Frisian Society for History, Antiquity and Language) in 1827
and, in particular, of the Frysk Selskip foar Fryske Tael- en Skriftekennisse (Frisian
Language and Literature Society) in 1844 provided the Frisian language with its first
organisational framework for linguistic emancipation. 14 There would be no
emancipation witho ut education, but it was not until 1937 that the Frisian language

acquired a modest foothold within Dutch education legislation. 15 The beginnings of
Frisian cultural policy can be traced back ten years earlier, to the decision of the
Frisian States to grant an annual subsidy to the Provinsjale Underwiisried (Provincial
Education Council).
3.2.3

During the 1950s, the position of Frisian in the different language fields was
strengthened even further. In administrative matters, in 1953 the government adopted
the position that the use of Frisian in oral communications was allowed in principle,
while the choice of language in written documents, provided they did not concern
matters involving a statutory obligation to submit them for inspection, was left to the
lower levels of government. 16 Legislation followed in the fields of education (1955)
and legal matters (1956). 17

3.2.4

In 1969, central government established an interministerial committee on Frisian
language politics. The committee’s brief included producing recommendations
regarding general government policy on issues concerning Frisian culture. The
committee’s final report, which was issued in 1970, was discussed in the House of
Representatives of the States General on 27 September 1972. 18 The report implicitly
recognised the central government’s responsibility for sustaining and promoting
Frisian language and culture. 19 The parliamentary discussion of the final report led the
committee to amend its position on the position of Frisian as a subject in primary
education. As a result of the amendment of the Primary Education Act in 1974,
Frisian became a compulsory subject in primary education in the province of Fryslân
as of 1 August 1980, 20 thereby gaining a regular place in education in the province.
This development has since continued steadily. As of 1 August 1993, for instance,
Frisian was made a compulsory subject in basic secondary education in all secondary
schools in the province of Fryslân, although secondary schools may obtain an
exemption from this requirement, as primary schools have been able to do since 1980.
For an overview of modifications to legislation in the field of education since 1980, in
so far as they relate to the position of Frisian, see chapter 6 and annexe 1.

3.2.5

During the 1980s, particular attention was devoted to the position of Frisian in official
matters. After a lengthy process of policy preparation, the first Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture was concluded in 1989, on the initiative of the
provincial executive of Fryslân (see section 2.16). 21 However, the legal basis for the
agreement in the first Covenant concerning the use of the Frisian language in
administrative matters proved to be inadequate for actual implementation. The second
Covenant of 1993 therefore included an agreement to consider the use of the Frisian
language in the context of the preparation of the General Administrative Law Act. 22

3.2.6

On 1 January 1996, the amendment of the General Administrative Law Act came into
force. 23 Sections 2:6 to 2:12 of the Act regulate the use of language in administrative

matters. With this amendment, central government formally recognised the bilingual
position of the province of Fryslân (see section 8.8 et seq.).
3.2.7

The second Covenant also introduced an expansion in the use of Frisian in judicial
and legal matters. As of 1 January 1997, the possibilities for using the Frisian
language in judicial and legal matters were expanded (see section 8.34). In addition,
the Notaries Act, which entered into force on 1 October 1999, expanded the
possibilities for drawing up notarial deeds in Frisian (see section 7.49). Finally, as of
1 February 2002, the constitutions of Frisian associations and foundations may be
drawn up in Frisian (see section 7.42).

3.2.8

In summary, it is clear that the official position of the Frisian language has improved
steadily, particularly since the second half of the twentieth century. The desire of the
province of Fryslân to create a legal basis for its Frisian language policy in areas
where the province’s own regulatory powers were previously insufficient or nonexistent has thereby largely been met.

3.3

Demographics

3.3.1

During the past 50 years, the population of the province of Fryslân increased from
465,000 to 630,539 in 2001. A year earlier, on 1 January 2000, the Frisian population
stood at 624,500. On 1 January 1999, it stood at 621,208. 24 This means that the
population increased by over 9,300 between 1999 and 2001. This growth was the
result of a positive birth rate and migration balance. 25 Based on the annual number of
people that moved to or left Fryslân between 1995 and 2000, it appears that
approximately 4.7 per cent of the population migrates each year. In 1999, the last year
for which migration statistics are available, 15,587 people moved to Fryslân and
14,107 people left. 26

3.3.2

It is clear that this mobility has an impact on the use of the Frisian language, but the
extent of the consequences of migration on the command and use of the Frisian
language is difficult to quantify. 27 In fact, the results of language research conducted
in Fryslân, which were published in 1969, 1984 and 1995, indicate that the position of
Frisian in Fryslân has been relatively stable until now (see sections 3.6.4 to 3.6.9). In
addition, the results of a surve y conducted among Frisian municipalities by the Berie
foar it Frysk organisation in 2000 demonstrated that eight of the twenty- five
municipalities that responded devote attention to the Frisian language in their
information to new residents (see also section 3.3.7). 28

3.3.3

The nature of the above- mentioned mobility is also a factor in relation to the use of
Frisian. After all, if only non-Frisian-speakers were to leave the province and only
Frisian speakers were to settle there, the annual migration figures would lead to an

increase in the use of Frisian in Fryslân. In practice, however, there is currently little
information on the language of the migrants in question.
3.3.4

In recent years, international migration has overtaken national migration in Frisian
migration figures. In fact, the influx of migrants from abroad has become particularly
significant for the growth of the Frisian population. 29 In 1999, the last year for which
figures are immediately available, 4,069 people moved to Fryslân from outside the
Netherlands, while 1,141 people moved abroad. 30 On 1 January 2001, the number of
people from ethnic minorities living in Fryslân stood at 49,706, accounting for 7.9 per
cent of the total Frisian population. On the same date, the number of people from no nWestern ethnic groups stood at 20,685, accounting for 3.3 per cent of the total
population of Fryslân. 31 The number of languages used in Fryslân has also risen
considerably in recent years. Thus, schools in Leeuwarden now have to deal with the
fact that approximately fifty foreign languages are spoken among their students. 32

3.3.5

During the preparations for the amendment of the Netherlands Nationality Act, the
State Secretary for Justice indicated in response to a number of parliamentary
questions that ‘an adequate command of Dutch suffices for the desired integration of
immigrants in Frisian society. Despite the fact that, in this context, it is equally
desirable that the newcomers learn to speak Frisian as well – and in practice this is
often the case – it would be too stringent a requirement to incorporate a command of
the Frisian language in the Act’s language requirement. Exclusively testing the
immigrants’ command of the Frisian language underestimates the level of the Frisian
population’s integration in the wider Dutch social framework as well as the
importance that should therefore be given to the integration of immigrants in that
wider framework.’ 33

3.3.6

A recent study of the command of Frisian among ethnic minorities living in Fryslân
indicates that an overwhelming majority of Iraqis have great difficulty understanding
Frisian. The same observation applies to at least half the Moroccans living in Fryslân.
Speaking Frisian is a problem for at least three-quarters of the members of these
groups. According to a study by the Economisch Bureau Coulon, however, almost
one in eight Moroccan youngsters can get by well in Frisian. Over a third of
Surinamese in Fryslân claim to be able to understand Frisian well or very easily, but
at least 80 per cent have great difficulty speaking Frisian or cannot speak it at all. 34

3.3.7

On 19 March 1999, the provincial advisory body on Frisian language policy, the Berie
foar it Frysk, held an afternoon workshop on integration issues and Frisian. This
workshop resulted in the publication of a report, as well as consultation between

representatives of the Berie foar it Frysk and representatives of the Frisian
municipalities and the province of Fryslân, which took place on 4 June 1999. 35 The
topic of discussion was the opinion of the Frisian authorities regarding the
recommendations formulated during the workshop, in order to facilitate the drafting
of an advisory report concerning the issue in question at a later date. 36 The provincial
authority of Fryslân expressed its intention to bring about the development of special
information material, glossaries of everyday Frisian words and phrases for social and
professional use, and language courses, as well as to enter into consultations with the
Frisian municipalities in order to produce informational material and simple glossaries
in various languages. 37
3.3.8

In response to a questionnaire sent by the Berie foar it Frysk to the municipalities in
Fryslân in 2000, four of the twenty-five municipalities responding indicated that they
devote attention to Frisian language and culture in their information material for
asylum seekers with residence status and foreign nationals who intend to stay in
Fryslân for an extended period. 38

3.3.9

In summary, it is clear that current migratory patterns have led to a significant
increase in language diversity in the Netherlands, and thus also in Fryslân. The
consequences of this development for the position of Frisian are as yet unknown,
although the province of Fryslân and a number of Frisian municipalities have devoted
more attention to the integration of foreign nationals in Frisian-speaking society in
recent years. The aforementioned provincial advisory body, the Berie foar it Frysk,
has also been involved in these efforts.

3.4

Economic situation

3.4.1

Although the share of agriculture in Frisian employment remains marginally higher
than in the Dutch economy, i.e. 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, the Frisian
economy long ago ceased to be an agrarian economy. The reduced relevance of
agriculture is also apparent from the comparison of the above- mentioned 7 per cent to
the 34 per cent that still applied in 1947. 39 An examination of the structure of
employment in Fryslân indicates that industry accounted for the largest share of
employment in 1999, with 18 per cent of jobs requiring at least 15 hours of work per
week, followed by commerce and repair work, with 14.9 per cent, and the health and
welfare sector, with 12.1 per cent. 40 The position of Frisian in the business and health
care sectors is discussed further in sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5 and in chapter 11.

3.4.2

Like its Dutch counterpart, the Frisian economy has developed in a relatively
favourable manner in recent years. It has even caught up to some extent, as the growth
rate of Frisian emp loyment has exceeded the national average by roughly a quarter of

a per cent in recent years. 41 Since 1990, moreover, the rise in the number of jobs in
Fryslân has been slightly higher than at national level. 42 Nevertheless, these figures do
not spell the imminent end of Frisian unemployment, which is caused by a growing
labour supply, in particular by the rise in the number of women on the labour
market. 43 In December 2000, 23,167 people – out of a workforce of 263,000 – were
registered as jobseekers in the province of Fryslân, 44 which was at least 4,000 people
less than at the beginning of the year. In relation to the figures for the whole of the
Netherlands, however, Frisian unemployment is still three percentage points higher. 45
3.4.3

Income in Fryslân is structurally lower than at national level. In 1997, average
disposable income per worker stood at €14,113 per year. At national level, the
equivalent sum was €15,111. Also in 1997, average disposable income per capita
stood at €8,985 in Fryslân and €9,983 in the Netherlands as a whole. 46

3.4.4

Research indicates that company managers in Fryslân do not devote systematic
attention to bilingualism or the government’s language policies. Although the general
opinion of the business sector is that bilingualism has no effect on the realisation of
corporate objectives, there has been resistance to the policy on official Frisianlanguage place names, as developed by a number of Frisian municipalities (see
section 11.2). 47

3.4.5

The command of Frisian among workers in the health care sector does not differ from
that among the inhabitants of Fryslân. There is very little focus in the health care
sector on policy concerning the use of Frisian. Frisian is used primarily in informal
situations, between colleagues and in conversations with clients, while Dutch is the
predominant choice for communicating with managers and in formal situations (see
sections 11.35 to 11.39). 48 Central government and the province of Fryslân are both
interested in strengthening the position of Frisian in the care sector, as indicated inter
alia by the objectives set out in the Covenant (Covenant 7.4 et seq.).

3.4.6

In summary, it appears that economic development in Fryslân has maintained a
similar position in relation to the national economy over the years. Although a certain
amount of progress has been evident in 1999-2001, no change has occurred in the
inferior position that the province has traditionally occupied in relation to the national
economy. In the business sector, Frisian mainly appears to be of interest in connection
with official Frisian- language place names. As in the business sector, there is very
little focus in the health care sector on policy concerning the use of Frisian.

3.5

Administrative structure

3.5.1

The basic administrative structure of the Netherlands, which consists of central
government, provinces and municipalities, is laid down in the Dutch Constitution.
In this context, two issues are relevant to this report. Article 123 of the Constitution
provides that provinces and municipalities may be established and dissolved, and
provincial and municipal boundaries redrawn, by law. Article 124 provides that
provinces and municipalities have the authority to manage their own economic and
administrative affairs (autonomy), although the state can take over the running of
provinces and municipalities by or in accordance with the law (shared government).
These provisions apply equally to the whole of the Netherlands, and thus also to the
province of Fryslân and the Frisian municipalities.

3.5.2

The two issues mentioned in the preceding paragraph are discussed in greater depth
below:
•
for the reorganisation of provinces and municipalities and/or the redrawing of
provincial borders and municipal boundaries, see sections 3.5.3 to 3.5.6;
•
for the tasks and responsibilities of provinces and municipalities, see sections
3.5.7 and 3.5.8.
In these sections, this report examines the extent to which the presence of the Frisian
language has an effect on policies concerning the reorganisation of, and the
distribution of tasks and powers to, the province of Fryslân and the Frisian
municipalities.

3.5.3

The consolidation of the administrative structure of the Netherlands, by increasing the
scale of municipalities through amalgamation and reorganisation, was an important
feature of government policy between 1998 and 2002. During this time, the
government also discussed the role and requisite scale of the provinces. In fact, the
combination of provinces into regions was raised on a number of occasions in the
academic literature on public administration. The government chose not to speak out
on this matter, but invited the provinces to consider the issue themselves.

3.5.4

In spring 2002, the provinces jointly issued a report on regional government in the
twenty-first century, which addressed the above-mentioned issue. The report already
regards provincial expansion in the Randstad conurbation as unavoidable, but does
not advocate such expansion – at least not for the moment – in respect of the other
provinces of the Netherlands, including Fryslân. However, the report does regard the
effective cooperation of Fryslân with both its neighbours as an important issue from
the point of view of administrative power. The official position of the province of
Fryslân regarding the above- mentioned report was not available at the time of writing.

3.5.5

In matters relating to the province of Fryslân, central government has committed itself
to respecting the administrative unit that is the province of Fryslân as a foundation for
its policies. Through this undertaking, which was laid down in the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (Covenant 1.2), the government continues to
implement undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under Article 7(1)(b) of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages

16

3.5.6

Since the redrawing of the municipal boundaries in 1984, the province of Fryslân has
comprised 31 municipalities. 49 The national debate on the further expansion of
municipalities has had no consequences for Fryslân during the past three years,
although the provincial authority of Fryslân has taken the initiative of analysing the
problem areas and shortcomings of Frisian local government. 50

3.5.7

With regard to the tasks and powers of the province of Fryslân and the Frisian
municipalities, it is important to note that central government’s recognition of Fryslân
as a bilingual province does not imply that the province has a special autonomous
status (see section 3.2.4). Nevertheless, the provincial authority of Fryslân does have a
number of special responsibilities that have been laid down by law, including the
authority to grant exemptions to primary schools from teaching Frisian as a
compulsory subject (see section 6.56). In addition, all local and regional
administrative bodies in Fryslân are authorised to establish rules concerning the use of
the Frisian language in written documents (see sections 8.25, 8.26 and 8.27).

3.5.8

In 1969, the provincial authority of Fryslân gave itself the power to determine the
official spelling of the Frisian language. 51

3.5.9

The Committee of Experts has determined that, in the case of the Frisian language, the
Netherlands has complied with Article 7(1)(b) of the European Charter for Regional
or Minority Languages. 52 This article relates in particular to the existence, borders and
responsibilities of the province of Fryslân, which have not undergone any changes. As
mentioned earlier, central government respects the administrative unit that is the
province of Fryslân (see section 3.5.5). The province of Fryslân is expected to issue a
more detailed statement of its position, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001).

3.5.10 In summary, it is clear that central go vernment has recognised the bilingual character
of the province of Fryslân, in the sense that Frisian has acquired a legally protected
position in judicial and administrative matters, education and various sectors of
society. In addition, the province of Fryslân possesses a limited number of specific
powers in respect of the Frisian language, which are generally grounded in national
legislation. Even so, the existence of the Frisian language has no consequences for the
administrative position of the province of Fryslân in the Netherlands’ overall
administrative structure.
3.6

The Frisian language

3.6.1

The present report limits itself primarily to Frisian in Fryslân, that is to say, the
language in respect of which the Netherlands has undertaken to apply a minimum of
thirty-five paragraphs or sub-paragraphs chosen from among the provisions of Part III
of the Charter. For Frisian spoken outside the province of Fryslân only the provisions
of Part II of the Charter are applicable, as well as Articles 8(2) and 12(2) of the
Charter.

The redrawing of municipal boundaries in 1984 initially reduced the number of Frisian municipalities by thirteen.

17

3.6.2

Frisian complies with the definition of a regional or minority language in the Charter,
in the sense that it is a living language traditionally spoken within the territory of what
is now the province of Fryslân by citizens of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, who
form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the population of the state. Seventyfour per cent of the population of the province of Fryslân, which stood at 630,000 in
2001, currently speaks Frisian (see section 3.6.4). In practice, Frisian is a living
language. 53

3.6.3

The Frisian language differs from Dutch, but is nevertheless related to it. Frisian
belongs to the West Germanic languages located, together with Dutch, somewhere
between German and English. In addition to its existence in the Netherlands, Frisian
also belongs to the indigenous languages spoken in Germany, although this involves
variants that differ to a greater or lesser extent from the Frisian used in the Dutch
province of Fryslân.

3.6.4

This report regards people with an active or passive command of the Frisian language
as users of Frisian. A recent study (1995) into the linguistic background, knowledge,
behaviour and attitude of Frisians questioned over 1,300 inhabitants of Fryslân on
these matters. 54 This study indicated that 74 per cent of the Frisian population is able
to speak Frisian. A significant part of this group (19 per cent) probably learnt Frisian
as a second language, as 55 per cent claim to have learnt Frisian as their mother
tongue. Over half the Frisian population speaks Frisian at home. Approximately 94
per cent can understand Frisian, 65 per cent can read Frisian and 17 per cent can write
Frisian.

3.6.5

Furthermore, on the basis of similar research published in 1969 55 and 1984 56 , there
appears to have been a slight decline in the ability to speak and read Frisian since the
early 1970s, while the ability to write Frisian appears to have increased. 57 In general,
however, it may be concluded that the position of Frisian in Fryslân is relatively
stable. 58

As far as the territory of the province of Fryslân is concerned, it should be noted that, in the municipalities of
Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf (total population over 51,000) in the south of the province and in the
municipaliy of het Bildt (population over 10,000) in the north, Frisian is spoken alongside the Stellingwerf (a
Lower Saxon variant) and Bildt dialects (see section 3.6.9). On the Frisian Islands (total population over 10,000),
almost no Frisian is spoken on Ameland and Vlieland. On Terschelling and Schiermonnikoog, a small minority
still speaks Frisian dialects, some of which differ substantially from standard Frisian.

The relatively stable position of Frisian is characterised by diglossia, a separation
between a community’s spoken and written languages, in which the lower variant –
Frisian – is used for everyday speech, and the higher variant – Dutch – for written
texts. 60 At the same time, however, it is clear that Dutch is in a stronger position than
Frisian as regards position and use in today’s multilingual Fryslân. 61

The superior status of Dutch as regards position and use also applies in relation to the
non-Frisian local languages and dialects spoken in Fryslân, which constitute the
mother tongue of 11 per cent of the population. The total number of active speakers of
local languages is estimated at approximately 48,000. An overwhelming majority of
this number speaks one of the urban dialects. Mention should also be made of the
Stellingwerf and Bildt dialects, which account for 11,500 and 3,200 speakers
respectively. 62 In view of the rapidly declining transmission of regional or minority
languages from generation to generation, the future looks bleak for the local
languages and dialects in question. 63

3.6.8

An examination of the use of Frisian in various sectors of society reveals the
following patterns. In the family, the workplace and the countryside, the position of
Frisian is relatively strong, but in more formal sectors, such as the written media,
government, legislation and education, its position is relatively weak, although there
has been a certain increase in the use of Frisian in these sectors in recent decades. 64
With regard to attitudes towards Frisian, 80 per cent of those questioned disagreed
with statements such as ‘Frisian is a dialect’, ‘Frisian is no longer relevant’ or ‘I don’t
want anything to do with Frisian’. 65 The same study indicates that Frisian means a
great deal to 65 per cent of the respondents, while to 13 per cent of those questioned it
is only of marginal importance.

3.6.9

At the end of 2001, the Ried fan de Fryske movement conducted a random telephone
survey of 285 inhabitants of Fryslân to determine the level of support for granting
equal treatment to Frisian. The main questions were whether the possibility of using
Frisian in all situations and/or sectors would generate problems and whether it is
reasonable to expect everyone to have a passive knowledge of Frisian. The
overwhelming majority of respondents did not believe that the possibility of using
Frisian is all situations and/or sectors would lead to problems. In addition, a
comfortable majority felt that an ability to understand Frisian could be regarded as a
basic social requirement. However, the respondents did not expect that everyone
should be able to read and write Frisian. 66

3.6.10 In summary, there appears to have been a slight decline in the ability to speak and
read Frisian since the beginning of the 1970s, while the ability to write Frisian
appears to have increased. In general, the position of Frisian in Fryslân is relatively
stable.
3.7

Policy

3.7.1

The most important policy document on the Frisian language during the period under
discussion is without doubt the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, which
was signed by central government and the province of Fryslân on 5 June 2001. This
report has already touched upon the nature of the new Covenant and the interaction
between the Covenant and the Charter (see section 2.16). The following paragraphs
examine various issues that are of particular relevance to the implementation of the
Covenant (see sections 3.7.2 to 3.7.5). This is followed by a summary of the degree to
which national and provincial policy documents currently address the implications of
the policy proposals concerning the Frisian language in various policy areas (see
section 3.7.6 et seq.).

3.7.2

This focus on the position of Frisian in policy documents is a direct consequence of
the new Covenant. In the general provisions of the Covenant, the parties agree that
central government and the province of Fryslân will ensure that all policy documents
relating to areas regarded as falling within the scope of the Covenant, having regard to
the provisions of the European Charter accepted by the Netherlands, will consider the
consequences of the policy intentions for the Frisian language (Covenant 1.1).

3.7.3

Two advisory bodies support Frisian language policy: the Consultative Committee on
the Frisian Language and the Berie foar it Frysk (Covenant 1.3 and 1.4). The first
body advises the Dutch government on all matters concerning the Frisian language by
reporting the needs and wishes in relation to the Frisian language and culture to the
Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. 67 The second body, the Berie foar it
Frysk, advises the provincial executive of Fryslân on general policy developments and
trends within society relating to the language policies of the province of Fryslân.

3.7.4

In the final provisions of the third Covenant, central government and the province of
Fryslân agree to use the 2001-2004 period to explore ways of operationalising the
provisions of the European Charter. The periods between 2004 and 2007 and 2007
and 2010 will be used for this purpose, where necessary by means of supplementary
legislation (Covenant 9.2 and 9.3).

3.7.5

In consultations that are to take place at least once every three years between central
government and the province of Fryslân concerning the implementation of activities
in the framework of the Covenant, the parties will conclude implementation covenants
for the above- mentioned periods that include agreements on funding. In addition, the
parties will issue annual reports on the implementation of the Covenant and the
related implementation covenants. These reports will be submitted to the House of
Representatives of the States General and the provincial council of Fryslân (Covenant
9.6).

3.7.6

The following paragraphs examine the manner in which central government and the
province of Fryslân are currently implementing Article 1(1) of the new Covenant. The
paragraphs follow the structure employed in Part III of the Charter, first for central
government and then for the province of Fryslân.

3.7.7

Government policy documents on education (Article 8 of the Charter). At
present, the government is preparing a number of changes in primary and secondary
education that may also have implications for the position of Frisian in education.
With regard to primary education, a committee established by the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science issued a report that was subsequently submitted to the
Education Council for an advisory report (see section 6.3). The government’s position
regarding the above- mentioned reports was not available at the time of writing.

3.7.8

With regard to the proposed changes in secondary education, the Education Council
indicated in its advisory report on basic secondary education that, in its opinion,
Frisian belongs in the optional curriculum and that the relevant attainment targets
should therefore be developed and brought up to date (see inter alia section 6.5).
Notwithstanding the agreements in Article 1(1) of the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001), the government did not comment on this section of the
Education Council’s advisory report. 68

68

The decree establishing the Consultative Committee on the Frisian Language was amended by a decree of 14
March 2002 to the extent that the committee’s tasks now include advising on the implementation of the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) and the associated implementation covenants. In addition, a decision
was made to increase the number of members from three to five, as well as to admit observers (Government
Gazette 2002, 62).

3.7.9

Government policy documents on the use of language in judicial and
administrative matters (Articles 9 and 10 of the Charter). Policy measures
concerning the use of the Frisian language in this area have been laid down in
legislation, and no policy documents that are relevant to the position of Frisian are
currently under discussion. However, the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom
Relations has pointed out on a number of occasions – for instance at the signing of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) – that government agencies
whose jurisdiction encompasses Fryslân ought to examine whether, in the light of the
Charter, a regulation needs to be drafted concerning the use of the Frisian language in
oral and written communications between such agencies and citizens in Fryslân.

3.7.10 Government policy documents on the media (Article 11 of the Charter). Policy
measures concerning the use of the Frisian language have been laid down in
legislation, and no policy documents that are relevant to the position of Frisian are
currently under discussion.
3.7.11 Government policy documents on culture (Article 12 of the Charter). The policy
document on culture for 1997-2000, which was issued in 1996, explicitly discusses
the presence of Frisian as a second language in the Netherlands. 69 This is not the case
in the new policy document on culture for 2001-2004. The explanation for this is that
the new policy document devotes no attention to language as an element of Dutch
cultural policy, including both Frisian and Dutch. None of this has any implications
for policy concerning the Frisian language, however, as the new policy document –
like the policy document of 1996 – lists the Frisian- language faculties and activities
that will be receiving grants (see further section 10.1).
3.7.12 Government policy documents on economic and social life (Article 13 of the
Charter). Specific policy memorandums that are relevant to the position of the
Frisian language are currently unavailable.
3.7.13 Government policy documents on international cultural relations (Article 14 of
the Charter). Specific policy documents that are relevant to the position of the
Frisian language are currently unavailable.
3.7.14 Other. On 1 February 1995, the Netherlands signed the Framework Convention for
the Protection of National Minorities (ETS 157), which was concluded in Strasbourg
on the same day. 70 On 4 February 1999, a bill for the approval of the Framework
Convention was submitted to the House of Representatives. 71 After its approval, the
protection of national minorities sought by the Convention will in any event apply to
the Frisians. In addition, the government has proposed to extend the intended
protection to the new minorities, i.e. persons residing in the Netherlands who belong
to the target groups of Dutch integration policy. The House of Representatives
approved the bill on 28 March 2000. At present, the bill is before the Senate. At the

request of the then Minister for Urban Policy and Integration of Ethnic Minorities,
however, the Senate has suspended its discussion of the bill. 72
3.7.15 Provincial policy documents on education (Article 8 of the Charter). With regard
to the position of Frisian in education, two provincial policy memorandums were
particularly relevant at the time of writing. The first memorandum is entitled ‘Plan fan
Oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis Provinsje Fryslân’ (Action Plan on Frisian in
Education) (see inter alia sections 6.12, 6.28, 6.51, 6.59, 6.80, 6.85, 6.90, 6.91, 6.128
and 6.134). The second memorandum is entitled ‘Aan de slag met onderwijskansen’
(Educational opportunities at work) (see section 6.52). It was developed by the
province of Fryslân for primary schools in Frisian municipalities, excluding
Leeuwarden, at the request of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. 73
Language is one of a number of possible regional themes mentioned in the
memorandum. For this purpose, the following key question was formulated: ‘Under
what circumstances would it be possible to set up bilingual primary education in such
a manner that students at ‘educational opportunity’ schools would also achieve good
results in Dutch and Frisian?’ 74
3.7.16 Provincial policy documents on the use of language in judicial and
administrative matters (Articles 9 and 10 of the Charter). The province has no
powers of its own with regard to the use of language in legal matters. Recent
provincial policy documents on this issue are therefore unavailable. However, the
provincial authority of Fryslân does intend to adopt a policy document on language
policy in 2002 (see sections 3.7.21 and 3.7.22).
3.7.17 Provincial policy documents on the media (Article 11 of the Charter). In 2001, the
provincial council of Fryslân adopted a memorandum on regional broadcasting,
entitled ‘Finansjele Ympuls Omrop Fryslân’, (Financial incentives for broadcasting in
Fryslân) which partially implements another memorandum on regional broadcasting,
entitled ‘Provinsjale Omropnotysje’, which was adopted in 1999. The 2001
memorandum is based on the section on the media in the new Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture. In addition, given the importance of the Frisian language, the
memorandum sets aside additional resources for Omrop Fryslân (the Frisian
broadcasting agency) during the 2001-2003 period, to help it create original Frisian
drama, broadcast major events and programmes on location, and improve the range
and quality of its daily television broadcasts (see section 9.24).
3.7.18 Provincial policy documents on culture (Article 12 of the Charter). With regard to
cultural policy, the province of Fryslân adopted a memorandum in 2000, entitled
‘Kultuer yn Fryslân 20.01\04’. This memorandum highlights the province of Fryslân’s
primary responsibility and initiatory role with regard to the Frisian language (see
sections 10.4 and 10.5). In 1998, the province of Fryslân adopted a separate
memorandum on literature policy. Through this memorandum, entitled ‘Notysje
Letterebelied’, provincial literature policy in Fryslân acquired a new legal foundation
as of 1 January 1999.

3.7.19 Provincial policy documents on economic and social life (Article 13 of the
Charter). Specific policy documents that are relevant to the position of the Frisian
language are currently unavailable, but the new policy document on language policy
will deal with these issues (see sections 3.7.21 and 3.7.22).
3.7.20 Provincial policy documents on international cultural relations (Article 14 of the
Charter). Specific policy documents on this issue are currently unavailable.
3.7.21 Other. In 2002, the provincial authority of Fryslân intends to adopt a policy
document on language that will give shape to its vision on Frisian language policy.
This policy document will replace the one issued by the provincial executive of
Fryslân in 1991, which was entitled ‘Ramtnota Taalbelied’ (Framework Document on
Language Policy) The administrative instruction for the new policy document, as
discussed in the provincial committee on welfare on 12 March 2002, indicates that the
motto of the policy document will be ‘Fan rjocht nei praktyk’ (From law to practice).
The starting point remains the equality and equal treatment of Frisian.
3.7.22 The administrative instruction was followed on 5 June 2002 by a memorandum,
entitled ‘Notysje Utgongspunten Nota Taalbelied’, which was discussed in the
provincial committee on welfare. This memorandum lists eight starting points for the
forthcoming policy document:
1.
implementing the objective of strengthening Frisian in all sectors of society;
2.
implementing the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001);
3.
developing a ‘made-to- measure’ approach;
4.
different provincial roles (directing, initiating, coordinating, etc.);
5.
participation of subsidised institutions;
6.
systematic communication;
7.
strategy development; and
8.
model function.

3.7.23
In summary, it is clear that the Frisian language is
receiving attention from central government as well as
from the province of Fryslân. The most important policy
document is the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001), which is of great significance from the point
of view of both policy and procedure. As far as further
policy documents of central government and the province
of Fryslân are concerned, developments are to be expected
primarily in the field of education and in relation to the use
of Frisian in administrative matters

PART I
4

General measures

4.1

According to the outline of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for
the preparation of the periodical reports, Part I should provide an overview of existing
laws and regulations that are relevant to the implementation of the European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages. The overview provided in annexe 1
distinguishes between national laws and regulations, bye- laws and regulations issued
by the province of Fryslân and bye- laws issued by the municipal authorities of
Fryslân.
The most important policy document concerning the Frisian language is the new
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001-2010), which was signed on
5 June 2001 (Government Gazette 2001, 125). In the framework of the Covenant,
central government and the province of Fryslân concluded numerous agreements to
improve the status of the Frisian la nguage and culture. Chapter 3 of the current report
also includes an overview of policy documents relevant to the Frisian language (see
sections 3.7.1 to 3.7.23). This overview distinguishes between central government
policy documents and those of the province of Fryslân. The province of Fryslân is
currently in the middle of implementing the provisions of the European Charter in its
own policies, thereby implementing the agreements made within the framework of the
Covenant. In this context, it has issued, or is currently drafting, the following policy
documents:
–
an educational action plan, entitled ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis
Provinsje Fryslân’;
–
an action plan concerning educational opportunities;
–
a memorandum on broadcasting, entitled ‘Finansjele Ympuls Omrop Fryslân’;
–
a memorandum on cultural policy, entitled ‘Kultuer yn Fryslân 20.01\04’;
–
a policy document on language policy.
No new case law concerning the Frisian language came into being between 1999 and
2001.

4.2

Annexe 6 provides an overview of legally established institutions and organisations
for the safeguarding and development of the Frisian language that are located in the
Netherlands.

4.3

Annexe 5 provides an overview of the bodies and organisations that were requested to
provide additional information during the preparation of this report, as well as the
institutions that provided additional comments or corrections regarding an earlier
version of this report.

4.4

According to Article 6 of the Charter the parties undertake to see to it that the
authorities, organisations and persons concerned are informed of the rights and duties
established by the Charter. the following activities are worth mentioning:
First, the Dutch government has involved the responsible regional aut horities,
institutions and associations as much as possible in the preparation of the periodical
reports, to ensure that they are well informed regarding the rights and duties arising
from the Charter. The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations ins tructed the

25

Fryske Akademy to prepare the report on the Frisian language, and the latter duly
involved the relevant authorities, institutions and associations in the preparation of the
report. In addition, the signing of the new Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) has also contributed to the fulfilment of the obligation contained in
Article 6 of the Charter. In cooperation with the Council of Europe, finally, the
Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations organised an international conference
on the European Charter, which took place in Noordwijkerhout on 30 November and
1 December 2001.
Second, it is worth mentioning the activities of the Consultative Committee on the
Frisian Language (see section 5.13). The task of this body, as already mentioned (see
section 3.7.3), is to report to the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations on
wishes and needs of Frisian- language groups in relation to the Charter. With this in
mind, the Committee holds periodic discussions with representatives of Frisian civilsociety organisations. On 23 June 1999, the Committee held a one-day workshop in
Leeuwarden that was attended by numerous organisations and institutions. The
Committee has used the conclusions from the above- mentioned discussions and the
workshop in its advice to central government.
Third, it is also worth mentioning the activities of the Berie foar it Frysk (see section
5.13). During the period covered by this report, these activities included an afternoon
workshop for Frisian municipal officials on 22 May 2001. 75 Prior to this, on 12
October 2000, the organisation held a workshop for Frisian municipal administrators,
in cooperation with the Association of Frisian Municipalities, which examined ways
in which municipalities can give fresh impetus to policies on Frisian language and
culture on the basis of the European Charter. 76
Fourth, it is worth drawing attention to activities that took place in Fryslân in 2001 in
the framework of the European Year of Languages. These activities also helped to
increase awareness of the European Charter (see sections 10.68-10.70).
Fifth, in recent years, a number of articles on the European Charter have appeared in a
Frisian- language journal, entitled De Pompeblêden, tydskrift foar Fryske stúdzje,
which is published by the Algemiene Fryske Underrjocht Kommisje (AFUK). 77
Finally, it is worth noting that the publication of the European Charter, as well as the
overview of signatures and ratifications, the monitoring mechanism and the
publication of, inter alia, the Committee of Experts’ findings, ensure that a wide
range of relevant information is always available. 78 The visit of the Committee of

Experts to the Netherlands and Fryslân, on 23-24 February 2000, received a
considerable amount of publicity. The same applies to the report of the Committee of
Experts, which was published at the end of 2001.
4.5

On 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe took
note of the report of the Committee of Experts and formulated a number of
recommendations. In these recommendations, which were included in the report of
the Committee of Experts as an annexe, the Committee of Ministers recommends that
the Netherlands take account of all the observations of the Committee of Experts and,
as a matter of priority:
1.

2.
3.
4.

take the necessary steps to ensure that a substantial part of pre-school and
primary education is available in Frisian. In order to achieve the authorities’
objectives in respect of Frisian, the quality and the continuity of the teaching
of Frisian throughout the education process, and in particular in secondary
education, should be improved. Further efforts should be made to ensure and
improve the necessary basic and further teacher training at primary and
secondary level, as far as Frisian is concerned;
ensure the practical implementation of existing legal provisions as regards the
use of Frisian in relation to the judicial and administrative authorities;
take into account the special needs of broadcasting in Frisian and consider
increasing its financial support;
develop a general national language policy for those languages covered only
by Part II of the Charter, based on the objectives and principles laid down
therein.

The implementation of these recommendations is currently in progress. It is worth
noting in this regard that, in anticipation of the Council of Europe’s recommendations,
central government and the province of Fryslân signed a new Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture, which implements many of the provisions of the Charter, on 5
June 2001. The implementation of the Covenant will also address the first three
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers. The fourth recommendation, which
relates to languages covered by Part II of the Charter, will be dealt with separately.
4.6

79

With regard to the steps it has undertaken to inform the government bodies, judicial
authorities and civil- society organisations concerned of the above- mentioned
recommendations, the Dutch government has noted with satisfaction, on the basis of
letters and comments from the relevant provincial authorities and organisations, that
the authorities and associations in question have already taken note of the report of the
Committee of Experts and the recommendations of the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe by other means, for example, via the websites of the Council of
Europe and the Dutch committee of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages.
In due course, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations also intends to post
the report and the recommendations on its website. 79 Furthermore, the Ministry of
Justice is liaising with the judicial authorities in Fryslân regarding the implementation
of the recommendations relating to Article 9 of the European Charter.

See http://www.minbzk.nl.

4.7

In answer to the question of how the government has involved the government bodies,
judicial authorities and civil- society organisations concerned in the implementation of
the recommendations, the reader is referred to sections 4.5 and 4.6 above.

PART II
5

Objectives and principles

5.1

Under Article 7 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the
Netherlands has undertaken to base its policies, legislation and practical measures in
respect of the Frisian language, within the territories in which the Frisian language is
used and according to the situation of the Frisian language, on the following
objectives and principles:

Article 7(1)(a): recognition of the Frisian language as an expression of cultural wealth

5.2

The Committee of Experts has determined that Article 7(1)(a) implies a recognition of
the existence of the Frisian language, as well as the legitimacy of its use. 80 In practice,
this provision is a precondition for taking the specific features and needs of the
language in question into consideration and for taking appropriate action on its behalf.
Furthermore, with its inclusion within the scope of the European Charter, the
Netherlands fully recognises the importance of the Frisian language as an expression
of cultural wealth.

Article 7(1)(b): respect of the administrative division of the language area

5.3

The Committee of Experts considers that Article 7(1)(b) has been fulfilled for the
Frisian language. 81 This provision particularly concerns the existence, borders and
tasks of the province of Fryslân, which have not been subject to change. As already
mentioned, central government and the province of Fryslân confirmed in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (Covenant 1.2) that central
government will respect the administrative unit that is the province of Fryslân (see
section 3.5.5).

Article 7(1)(c): need for resolute action

5.4

80
81

It is clear that the Dutch authorities at national, provincial and municipal level are
generally aware of the need to safeguard the Frisian language. This is also indicated
by the fact that central government and the province of Fryslân, by signing a new
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, are seeking to implement the
undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under Part III of the European Charter.
The actual implementation of these undertakings is discussed in greater depth in Part
III of this report.

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 15.
Ibid., 16.

28

Article 7(1)(d): facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of the Frisian language

5.5

The actions taken by the Dutch government to facilitate and/or encourage the use of
the Frisian language in speech and writing in public and private life are described in
Part III of this report.

Article 7(1)(e): maintenance and development of links between groups using the Frisian language and other
groups employing a language used in identical or similar form

5.6

The actions taken by the Dutch government to maintain and develop links between
Frisian-speakers and other groups using identical or similar languages are described in
Part III, chapters 10 and 12, of this report.

Article 7(1)(f): teaching and study of the Frisian language

5.7

The actions taken by the Dutch government to provide appropriate forms and means
for the teaching and study of the Frisian language at all appropria te stages of
education are described in Part III, chapter 6, of this report.

Article 7(1)(g): facilities enabling non-speakers of the Frisian language living in Fryslân to learn the Frisian
language

5.8

The actions taken by the Dutch government to provide the facilities enabling nonspeakers of the Frisian language living in Fryslân to learn the Frisian language if they
so desire are described in Part III, chapters 6 and 10, of this report.

Article 7(1)(h): study and research of the Frisian language at universities

5.9

The actions taken by the Dutch government to promote the study and research of the
Frisian language at universities or equivalent institutions are described in Part III,
chapters 6 and 10, of this report.

Article 7(1)(i): transnational exchanges

5.10

The actions taken by the Dutch government to promote appropriate types of
transnational exchanges, in the fields covered by the European Charter, for Frisianspeakers in the Netherlands and Germany are described in Part III, chapter 12 of this
report.

Article 7(2): eliminating any unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference

5.11

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook to eliminate, if it had
not yet done so, any unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference
relating to the use of the Frisian language and intended to discourage or endanger its
maintenance or development. The adoption of special measures in favour of the
Frisian language, aimed at promoting equality between users of the Frisian language
and the rest of the population, or which take due account of their specific conditions,
is not considered to be an act of discrimination against the users of more widely- used
languages. The Committee of Experts considers that in general the Netherlands fulfils
this undertaking. 82

Article 7(3): promoting mutual understanding
82

Ibid., 45.

29

5.12

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook to promote, by
appropriate measures, mutual understanding between all the linguistic groups of the
country and, in particular, the inclusion of respect, understanding and tolerance in
relation to the Frisian language among the objectives of education and training
provided within the Netherlands and encouragement of the mass media to pursue the
same objective. The Committee of Experts considers that there is no evidence, apart
from some efforts concerning the position of the Frisian language in the media, that
the Netherlands has undertaken any initiatives of the kind described in Article 7(3). 83
In so far as specific actions to promote mutual understanding are concerned, this
report is also unable to provide any evidence of initiatives during the period it covers,
with the exception of the aforementioned workshop and the subsequent report and
consultations on integration issues and Frisian (see section 3.3.7).

Article 7(4): advisory mechanisms

5.13

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, in determining its
policy with regard to the Frisian language, to take into consideration the wishes and
needs of Frisian- language groups. These groups are encouraged to establish bodies, if
necessary, for the purpose of advising the authorities on all matters pertaining to the
Frisian language.
On 15 January 1998, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations issued a
decree establishing a Consultative Committee on the Frisian Language for the purpose
of advising the Dutch government on all matters pertaining to the Frisian language
(Government Gazette 1998, 33).84 This Committee, which was inaugurated on 19
January 1998 in Leeuwarden, currently comprises five members and a secretary who
is a civil servant. 85 In June 2000, the Consultative Committee issued a memorandum
in the form of an advisory report on the first report concerning the measures adopted
by the Netherlands in respect of the Frisian language to the State Secretary for the
Interior and Kingdom Relations. 86 The Berie foar it Frysk advises the provincial
authority of Fryslân on language policy and related general policy issues. In addition,
the organisation is also responsible for advising the provincial authority on the
relationship between provincial language policy and that of the Frisian municipalities
and central government, actions to ensure that provincial language policy is not
isolated from provincial policies in other areas, the policies of other government
bodies and developments in society, and issues requiring further study and research. 87

The decree establishing the Consultative Committee on the Frisian Language was amended by the decree of 19
February 2002, ref. BW2002/U58332, to the extent that a new second paragraph has been added, as a result of
which the Committee’s responsibilities now include advising the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations
on the implementation of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) and the associated
implementation covenants, in relation to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (Government
Gazette 2002, 62).
By a decree of 19 February 2002, ref. BW2002/U58333, the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom
Relations appointed or reappointed the five members of the consultative body on the Frisian language, while
taking account of the relevant retirement schedule.

The Committee of Experts has established that the provincial authority of Fryslân and
the Fryske Akademy were consulted prior to the adoption of the report as well as
during its preparation. 88 A similar procedure was followed for the adoption and
preparation of the present report (see annexe 6).
Article 7(5): non-territorial languages

5.14 Article 7(5) regulates the application of the principles listed in paragraphs 1 to 4 to
non-territorial languages. It therefore does not apply to the Frisian language.

PART III

Article 8: Education

6.1

Pre-school facilities – such as playgroups and childcare centres – do not fall under the
responsibility of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science in the Netherlands
and are not formally part of the Dutch education system. On the basis of section 4 of

providing pre-school education is decentralised and belongs to the municipalities.
Funding for pre-school education comes from the Municipalities Fund.

6.2

Primary education in the Netherlands is aimed at children between the ages of four
and twelve and lasts eight years, which in practice are divided into eight year groups.
Although primary schools admit children from the age of four, compulsory education
starts at the age of five. 89 Ninety-nine per cent of children begin attending school at
the age of four. Primary education and special schools for primary education are
regulated by the Primary Education Act (WPO) (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1998,
495). The WPO replaced the Primary Education Act (WBO) of 1981, but differs from
it on only a few points and did not modify the requirements regarding the subject of
Frisian. 90 This means that, pursuant to section 9, subsection 4 of the WPO, primary
schools and special primary schools for primary education must also provide
education in the Frisian language in the province of Fryslân, unless the provincial
executive of Fryslân has granted an exemption (see section 6.50). Pursuant to section
9, subsection 8 of the WPO, primary schools and special primary schools for primary
education may also use Frisian as a language of instruction (see sections 6.50 and
6.51). Pursuant to section 9, subsection 5 of the WPO, attainment targets for the
Frisian language are established by means of an order in council (see section 6.3).
Section 134, subsection 2 of the WPO regulates the annual reimbursement for of the
cost of maintaining Frisian- language education (see section 6.54). Finally, section

The bill amending the Primary Education Act, the Expertise Centres Act and the Compulsory Education
Act 1969 in respect of certain age limits and other matters provides that compulsory education shall start at
the age of four: see Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 2001-2002, 28 085, nos. 1 and 2.
In the past, special schools did not fall under the Primary Education Act. As of 1998, however, the old
MLK and LOM schools for children with learning difficulties or with learning and behavioural difficulties
(now known as special schools for primary education) fall under the new Primary Education Act. Children
with severe learning difficulties and children with physical, visual and other disabilities follow a form of
special education that does not fall under the Primary Education Act, but under the Expertise Centres Act
(WEC) (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1998, 496) (see section 6.56).

31

186, subsection 5 of the WPO determines which certificates of competence authorise
qualify teachers to teach in Frisian (see section 6.169).
6.3

In 1993, for the first time, the Minister of Education set attainment targets for all
compulsory subjects in primary education. 91 Since then, primary schools have been
required to treat the attainment targets in each subject as goals that must be achieved
by the end of primary education. In 1998, the attainment targets of 4 May 1993 were
revised. The Primary Education (Attainment Targets) Decree of 1998 (Bulletin of
Acts and Decrees 1998, 354) set new attainment targets for the Frisian language that
are compulsory only for schools in the province of Fryslân. These targets are the same
as the attainment targets for Dutch. The Primary Education (Attainment Targets)
Decree came into force on 1 August 1998 and includes a three-year transitional
period.

6.4

In January 2002, the Committee on Attainment Targets in Primary Education, chaired
by W.H.F.W. Wijnen, issued an advisory report on the use of attainment targets in
primary education, entitled ‘Verantwoording Delen’ (Sharing Responsibility). 92 This
advisory report differentiates between a core component, consisting of subjects that
are compulsory in all schools, and a differentiated component, which enables each
school to make an individual selection from the national curriculum, based on the
nature of the student population, parental preferences and the mission, objectives and
identity of the school. The advisory report accords the Frisian language an
intermediate position in primary education. In its recommendations, the Committee
placed Frisian in the differentiated component, but with the proviso that it did not
mean to tamper with established requirements regarding the teaching of Frisian in
Fryslân. [Deleted final sentence of paragraph.]

6.5

Secondary education in the Netherlands is regulated by the Secondary Education Act
(WVO). There are various types of secondary education:
•
pre-vocational secondary education (VMBO), a combination of what was
formerly known as junior general secondary education (MAVO) and prevocational education (VBO). VMBO was launched on 1 August 1999 and lasts
four years;
•
practical training (formerly special secondary education for children with
learning difficulties) and learning support (formerly special secondary
education for children with learning and behavioural difficulties);
•
senior general secondary education (HAVO), lasting five years;
•
pre-university education (VWO), lasting six years.
Compulsory education ends at the end of the school year in which a student reaches
the age of sixteen.

6.6

In theory, since the 1993-1994 school year, all secondary schools start with the same
general programme, known as basic secondary education. The programme lasts for a
period of two to four years, with an average length of three years (ages twelve to
fifteen). 93 In the interests of the students, each school can design its basic secondary

education programme in such a manner that students achieve the relevant attainment
targets in a minimum of two or a maximum of four years. As of 1 August 2001, the
requirement to conclude basic secondary education with a series of final tests no
longer applies (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2001, 340).
6.7

The recommended timetable for basic secondary education comprises fifteen subjects
that are compulsory for all students, but in practice schools are able to introduce
considerable variations. For schools in Fryslân, basic secondary education also
includes the teaching of Frisian (see section 6.84).
The Education Inspectorate has now evaluated the first five years of basic secondary
education (1993-1998) and published its findings in a report, entitled ‘Werken aan de
basis; evaluatie van de basisvorming na vijf jaar’ (see sections 6.90 to 6.92). The
Inspectorate also published sub-reports for each subject, including Frisian. 94 The main
report identifies a number of problems in basic secondary education, including
fragmentation and overloading of the syllabus and insufficient allowance for
differences between students. In October 2001, at the request of the State Secretary
for Education, Culture and Science, the Education Council issued an advisory report
on how to adapt basic secondary education in the short term (resolving the most
important problems as quickly as possible) and the long term (performing a thorough
review of basic secondary education). 95 These developments, and their implications
for the position of Frisian in basic secondary education, are discussed in greater depth
in sections 6.93 to 6.98.

6.8

Basic secondary education is followed by the second stage of secondary education or
studiehuis. It was introduced on 1 August 1998 and consists of the upper years of
HAVO (years 4 and 5) and VWO (years 4, 5 and 6). The term ‘second stage’ refers to
the syllabus. The term studiehuis refers to the way in which the syllabus is taught, for
example, the number of traditional classes and the amount of time that students study
independently. The objectives of the studiehuis are that students ‘learn how to learn’,
are better prepared for higher education and acquire greater general knowledge. 96
In the second stage, students can choose between four subject combinations: culture
and society, economics and society, science and health and science and technology.
Each subject combination includes a number of subjects that are common to all
subject combinations, a component that is specific to the chosen subject combination
and an optional component (section 12, subsections 2, 3 and 4 of the Secondary

The Education Council is the government’s advisory body on education. In this capacity, it advises the
government on key policy and legislative issues in the field of education. It occupies an independent
position in relation to both the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Nature Management and Fisheries, as well as to the education sector. Not only does the Council advise the
relevant ministers and state secretaries – either at their request or on its own initiative – but the House of
Representatives and the Senate can also seek its advice. In addition, in certain special cases regulated by
law, municipalities may also consult the Council. The Council consists of a maximum of nineteen members
who are appointed in a personal capacity for a period of four years by Royal Decree. Following their initial
appointment, members may be reappointed twice. They are independent and do not represent any interest
groups. The members of the Council are appointed on the basis of their expertise and come from various
sectors of society (education, science, public administration, etc.).

stage of HAVO and VWO (see sections 6.100 to 6.104).
6.9

After basic secondary education, students at VMBO schools can choose between four
programmes: a theoretical programme, a middle- management vocational programme,
a basic vocational programme and a combined theoretical and vocational programme
(sections 10 to 10d of the Secondary Education Act). The programmes consist of a
common component, which is compulsory for all students, a sectoral component,
which depends on whether the student has opted for engineering and technology, care
and welfare, agriculture or economics, and an optional component, in which students
can choose between a number of subjects, depending on the programme they have
chosen. The various programmes all link up with secondary vocational education
(MBO). Finally, secondary education in the Netherlands also includes learning
support and practical training, which incorporate what was previously known as
individualised pre-vocational training (IVBO). 98 Students can also opt to study Frisian
as an exam subject in pre- vocational secondary education (see sections 6.100 to
6.106).

6.10

Higher education in the Netherlands encompasses higher professional education
(HBO), university education (WO) and university- level distance learning through the
Open University (OU). Higher education is regulated by the Higher Education and
Research Act of 8 October 1992 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 593). A number of
amendments have since brought about the adjustment of certain aspects of the Act. In
2000, the full text of the Act, as it stood on 1 January 2000, was published in the
Bulletin of Acts and Decrees (2000, 11).

6.11

On 19 June 1999, the European ministers of education adopted the Bologna
Declaration, which foresees the eventual creation of a European education area. 99 The
implications of this development still need to be determined in greater depth, but it is
already clear that the desired international coordination at least implies the
introduction of an undergraduate/graduate model, including a statutory system of
bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Every country is entitled to implement the BA/MA
structure as it sees fit, and the Netherlands has opted to maintain the existing binary
structure, that is to say, the distinction between university education and higher
professional education. Under the new structure, Dutch universities offer two cycles:
the doctoraal, which is equivalent to a master’s degree at international level, and the
kandidaats stage, which educates students to the level of a bachelor’s degree. Higher
professional education consists of one cycle, which is equivalent to a bachelor’s
degree at international level. It has been decided that colleges of higher professional
education will also offer master’s degrees, but the question of whether and how these
degrees will be funded has yet to be answered. A number of academic institutions will
introduce the new structure at the beginning of the 2002-2003 academic year. It is not
yet clear, however, what the position of research training and teacher training,
including teacher training in Frisian, will be in the new structure. Under the new
BA/MA structure, the position of Frisian as a subject at the University of Amsterdam
also remains unclear. 100

The Adult and Vocational Education Act (WEB) (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1995,
501) came into force in January 1996. 101 As its name suggests, the Act addresses
vocational education (section 7.2.2) and adult education (section 7.3.1). The purpose
of the Act was to combine all existing institutions for secondary vocational education
and adult education into a network of approximately fifty Regional Training Centres
(ROCs) through a process of mergers. This has now been achieved. There are
currently two ROCs in the province of Fryslân, the Friese Poort and the Friesland
College, as well as an Agricultural Training Centre (AOC) for education in the field
of agriculture and the natural environment. AOCs also fall under the Adult and
Vocational Education Act.

6.13

In the Netherlands, teacher training for the various levels of education is part of
higher education, with the exception of teacher training for pre-school education,
which falls within the scope of secondary vocational education (MBO) (see section
6.167).

6.14

In its report, the Committee of Experts encourages the Dutch government to make
available a substantial part of pre-school education in Frisian. 102 The Committee of
Experts then invites the government to make available a substantial part of primary
education in Frisian. 103

6.15

The Committee of Experts further encourages the government to take the necessary
steps to improve the present position of Frisian in secondary education. The
Committee advocates the establishment of clear attainment targets for Frisian. In
addition, it encourages the government to ensure that the quality and continuity of the
educational process are improved so that these objectives can be met. This would
certainly make Frisian a more attractive choice for students in the second stage of
secondary education. 104

6.16

The Committee of Experts encourages the government to pursue a more active
approach with respect to the provision of facilities for the study of the Frisian
language as a subject in higher education. 105

6.17

The Committee encourages the government to arrange for the provision of adult and
continuing education courses in Frisian. 106

6.18

The Committee encourages the government to ensure the provision of an adequate
level of Frisian education in the initial and in-service training of all teachers required
to implement tho se provisions of Article 8(1)(a) to (g) of the European Charter that
were accepted by the Netherlands when it ratified the Charter. 107

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed tha t established central government policies regarding
the position of Frisian in education would serve as a foundation for the education
section. This applies in particular to the following statements:
•
central government will decide general policies on education, culture and the
media and will be directly or indirectly responsible for ensuring compliance
with the European Charter as regards the Frisian language;
•
the province of Fryslân will decide policies on the Frisian language and will be
responsible for ensuring that they are implemented;
•
central government will make resources available to enable the province of
Fryslân to implement its policies on the Frisian language;
•
the Frisian language policies of the province and the general education, culture
and media policies of central government must wherever possible be
complementary. 108

6.20

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will award a special-purpose
grant to the province of Fryslân for use in relation to Frisian-language education
under such conditions as may be imposed at the time the grant is awarded. This grant
will be used by the province to safeguard and improve the position of Frisian within
education. (Covenant 2.3.1). To implement this agreement, the province of Fryslân
has drafted a policy document, entitled ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’,
which sets out how the grant will be spent (see section 6.21).

6.21

In November 2001, the provincial authority of Fryslân issued a preliminary draft of
the above- mentioned policy document presenting its action plan for education. After
the reference date selected for this report, the preliminary draft was replaced with a
final document, which is not considered here. 109 At any rate, the policy document is
part of an attempt to implement provincial undertakings entered into under the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001). This chapter provides an indepth discussion of the provincial action plan:
•
pre-school sector (section 6.29)
•
primary education (sections 6.54 n, 6.56, 6.58, 6.67 and 6.71)
•
secondary education (sections 6.97, 6.102, 6.106 and 6.109)
•
secondary vocational education and adult education (sections 6.145 and 6.149)
•
teacher training (sections 6.170 and 6.182 n)
•
higher professional education (sections 6.129 and 6.130)
•
teaching of Frisian history and culture (section 6.155)

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to make available a
substantial part of pre-school education’ in Frisian. ‘Substantial’ implies that more
than a symbolic number of teaching periods are conducted in Frisian, in other words,
that Frisian is used as one of the languages of instruction. 110

On 5 June 2002, the provincial committee on welfare considered a revised version of the action plan.

36

6.23

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that pre-school education is not within
the competence of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and that it is
therefore not formally part of the Dutch education system. Pre-school education falls
within the competence of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and is organised
and supervised by the municipal authorities. The Committee also notes that no
statutory measures have been taken to ensure the use of Frisian at pre-school level.
Furthermore, the Committee has received information that out of 225 playgroups in
Fryslân only seven operate in Frisian. There is insufficient teaching material in Frisian
and no adequate training of playgroup workers in Frisian. The Committee therefore
considers that the Netherlands is not fulfilling this undertaking. 111

6.24

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that, when preparing a statutory regulation to satisfy
the relevant provisions of the European Charter, central government will take account
of Frisian- language activities in pre-school settings and liaise with the province of
Fryslân on how best to do this (Covenant 2.1.1). In addition, central government will
contact the province of Fryslâ n to discuss the position of Frisian in pre-school
education whenever legislation is to be enacted on quality objectives for this part of
the education system (Covenant 2.2.1). In both cases, the provisions of the Charter
that have been endorsed by the Netherlands will form the basis of any relevant
legislation.

6.25

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will consult with the social
partners on whether it is practicable for the initial training of playgroup and childcare
workers in Fryslân to include active and passive Frisian language skills and the
specific educational skills needed to teach bilingual and multilingual children at preschool level (Covenant 2.1.2). The parties agreed that this objective would be realised
by 2004.

6.26

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that each party will provide a one-off grant of NLG
240,000 to encourage the development of Frisian- language educational materials for
use in playgroups and childcare centres (Covenant 2.1.3). 112 The parties agreed that
this objective would be realised by 2004.

6.27

For the longer term, i.e. for the period until 2010, central government and Fryslân
agreed in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) that both parties
will work to improve the position of Frisian in playgroups by encouraging
municipalities to include Frisian in local ordinances on playgroups (B.A. 2.1.4).

6.28

Section 20, subsection 1 of the Social Welfare Act 1994 states that quality
requirements for certain types of childcare designated by order in council shall be
established by municipal bye- law. On this basis, the Minister of Health, Welfare and
Sport established a number of minimum quality requirements in the Childcare Quality
Requirements (Temporary Measures) Decree of 1 January 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1995, 578). In all other cases, quality requirements are to be established by

municipal bye- law. Playgroups do not fall within the scope of the Childcare Quality
Requirements (Temporary Measures) Decree, but an order in council on quality
requirements for playgroups is currently in preparation. The question of whether
Frisian will have a place among these requirements is still the subject of further
research. 113
In the near future, the government intends to regulate childcare separately by means
of a new piece of legislation, namely, the Basic Childcare Provision Act, which is
expected to come into force on 1 January 2004. Until then, the above- mentioned
decree will continue to apply. A plan exists to include the quality requirements
established by the Basic Childcare Provision Act in relation to the Frisian language in
an order in council. 114 For the time being, playgroups will not be included in the
law. 115
6.29

According to the aforementioned action plan of November 2001, the province of
Fryslân is planning to increase the number of Frisian- language or bilingual pre-school
education facilities by ten playgroups and/or childcare centres per year. 116 In addition,
the province has provided the Stichting Partoer, a provincial support organisation for
care and welfare in Leeuwarden, with €122,500 to develop Frisian- language teaching
material for playgroups and childcare centres, in cooperation with the Stifting
Pjutteboartersplak, between 2000 and 2004. 117

6.30

The objective of the Stifting Pjutteboartersplak, founded in 1989 on the initiative of
parents, is the preservation of Frisian- language playgroups. The organisation strives to
provide a Frisian- language setting for young children to play in. These Frisianlanguage playgroups, or pjutteboartersplakken, are open to Frisian-speaking and
Dutch-speaking children, as well as children that speak other languages. The first
Frisian- language playgroups developed in urban centres where parents were unhappy
about the fact that local pre-school facilities gave little or no consideration to the
Frisian- language background of their children. In 2001, the organisation was
responsible for approximately 200 children in five playgroups in various towns and
villages in Fryslân. 118 In addition, there are two Frisian- language playgroups in the
municipality of Leeuwarden, namely, in Lekkum and Leeuwarden. 119

6.31

On 3 December 2001, the first bilingual childcare centre, Bernestate, was opened in
Leeuwarden. The centre allows parents to choose a Dutch-speaking or a Frisianspeaking group for their children. Children from both groups interact with each other

The Stifting Pjutteboartersplak previously ran these two playgroups as well. A local welfare organisation,
the Stichting Hulp en Welzijn Leeuwarden, has now taken over responsibility for these two Frisianlanguage facilities. This transfer, which has preserved the Frisian-language character of the facilities in
question, reflects municipalities’ growing preference to work with a single umbrella organisation on welfare
issues, including playgroup facilities (see section 6.32).

in the main playroom. Bernestate was established on the initiative of the Stifting
Pjutteboartersplak, in cooperation with Catalpa, a national childcare organisation for
children up to the age of 13.
6.32

In addition, in September 1999, an association called the Feriening Frykstalige
Berneopfang (FBO) was established on the initiative of the Stifting
Pjutteboartersplak. The FBO's objective is to strengthen and develop the use of
Frisian in playgroups and childcare centres. For this purpose, it has established a
review committee that advises and supports the teachers and the boards of the relevant
playgroups and childcare centres. In addition, the FBO can officially designate
playgroups and childcare centres as Frisian-speaking if they meet the necessary
requirements. The FBO was established because more and more municipalities are
creating umbrella organisations for all playgroups and childcare centres, including
both Dutch-language and Frisian- language facilities. This is easier for the
municipalities, as they now need to fund just one organisation, which then takes care
of distributing the money. However, this development has made it more difficult for
the Stifting Pjutteboartersplak to establish playgroups independently. It established
the FBO in order to be able to continue guaranteeing Frisian- language childcare. 120
In addition, the Stifting Pjutteboartersplak is seeking to participate in a European
project, entitled Mehrsprachigkeit in der Vor- und Grundschulperiode
(Multilingualism in preschool and primary school). The organisers were approached
in 1999 and it is currently waiting for a European grant.

6.33

Apart from the activities of the Stifting Pjutteboartersplak, a ‘substantial’ part of preschool education in Frisian is realised only with difficulty. In fact, a recent study by
the Economisch Bureau Coulon into the use and position of Frisian in playgroups and
childcare centres in the province of Fryslân indicates that the situation has hardly
changed since the first Dutch report to the Council of Europe. 121 There is a lack of
Frisian- language teaching material, only seven of the 225 playgroups are fully
Frisian-speaking and training for childcare workers devotes little if any attention to
multilingualism in general and Frisian in particular. However, in the framework of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and the
province of Fryslân have agreed that their policies will aim to improve this situation
in the coming years (see sections 6.24-6.27).

6.34

Researchers from the Economisch Bureau Coulon have concluded that more Frisian is
spoken in playgroups than in childcare centres. This is because Frisian is more
common in the countryside, where there are more playgroups than in urban areas,
where childcare centres are more common. It was also found that playgroups and
childcare centres do not operate an official language policy; whether or not Frisian is
spoken depends to a large extent on the language background of the childcare workers
and the children. In ‘mixed’ situations, for example, in a group of children with
different language backgrounds or during parent evenings, people generally speak
Dutch. Possession and use of Frisian- language books, music cassettes and CDs trails
far behind that of the equivalent Dutch- language material. Both in the countryside and

39

in urban areas, the language of communication during group activities is generally
Dutch.
6.35

Almost all childcare workers can understand Frisian, and 80 per cent can speak and
read Frisian moderately to well. Writing appears to be more of a problem. Frisian is
the mother tongue of more than half of all childcare workers, but appears to be in
decline among those that completed their training more recently. It is therefore
possible that the proportion of childcare workers with a Frisian- language background
will decline in the future. At any rate, a large majority of childcare workers have had
no formal education in the Frisian language.

Frisian occupies a disadvantaged position in playgroups and childcare centres, both in
the countryside and in urban areas. The Economisch Bureau Coulon has discovered
that there is a discrepancy between attitudes towards Frisian and its actual use. In fact,
in situations where a choice can or must be made between Dutch and Frisian, positive
attitudes towards Frisian rarely result in a choice to actually use the language.

6.37

Municipal language policy for playgroups and childcare centres is almost nonexistent, even in municipalities that have introduced language policies regarding
certain aspects of municipal organisation, such as Frisian- language place names,
responding in Frisian to Frisian- language correspondence and internal communication
in Frisian (see sections 8.35 and 8.36). In fact, the municipalities have left
responsibility for language policy in pre-school education to the institutions
concerned. None of these institutions have established explicit language policies. At
most, their approach can be described as reactive: in individual cases, children that
speak Frisian are spoken to in Frisian. With a certain amount of good will, however,
this might be described as a modest form of language policy on the part of the
institutions.

6.38

On the basis of the results of the above- mentioned study, the Economisch Bureau
Coulon has concluded that it would be desirable to incorporate the requirement under
Article 8(1)(a)(ii) of the European Charter into national legislation. 122 In this context,
reference may be made to the Social Welfare Act 1994 or the new Basic Childcare
Provision Act and the associated orders in council applying to childcare and
playgroups (see section 6.28).

6.39

In summary, it is clear that no statutory measures have yet been taken regarding the
position and use of Frisian in playgroups in the province of Fryslân. Furthermore, no
statutory provision has been made for the integration of Frisian in the ordinary
training of playgroup and childcare workers in the province of Fryslân. Formally
speaking, that is to say, with regard to legislation, no changes have occurred since the
publication of the previous periodic report. It remains to be seen when and how
central government and the province of Fryslân will operationalise the agreements
reached within the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001), as described in section 6.24 above.

Article 8(1)(b)(ii): primary education

6.40

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to make available a
substantial part of primary education’ in Frisian. ‘Substantial’ implies that more than
a symbolic number of teaching periods are conducted in Frisian, in other words, that
Frisian is used as one of the languages of instruction. 123

6.41

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that it is difficult to determine whether
this undertaking has been fulfilled, as the most recent report of the Education
Inspectorate with regard to Frisian as a language of instruction at primary-school level
dates from 1988-1989.124 This is due to the fact that the Committee did not have
access to the Education Inspectorate’s 2001 report during its deliberations.

6.42

The Committee of Experts also notes that although there is a statutory framework and
the authorities have adopted attainment targets for Frisian at primary-school level,
there is much doubt whether these objectives can be achieved in practice. According
to the information reaching the Committee, few primary schools teach in Frisian and,
if they do, it is only one lesson per week, which cannot be interpreted as a ‘substantial
part of primary education’. 125

6.43

The Committee of Experts considers that the undertaking entered into by the
Netherlands is not being fulfilled. 126 With the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001), however, the Netherlands is seeking to strengthen the position of
Frisian in primary education, in accordance with the undertaking it entered into under
the European Charter (see sections 6.44-6.49).

6.44

Pursuant to the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân will encourage primary schools which
include Frisian in their syllabus and use it as a language of instruction to implement
quality assurance policies in this respect. The instruments available to schools for this
purpose will be reviewed to see whether they are suitable for use in relation to Frisian;
where necessary they will be modified, and information about them will be given to
the schools (Covenant 2.4.1). The parties agreed that this objective will be realised by
2004.

6.45

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that together they will systematically collect data on
the place of Frisian in the quality assurance policies of schools and on the objectives
schools set for themselves with regard to the Frisian- language skills of their staff.
There will be consultations with the Regional Training Centres127 in Fryslân in order
to encourage them to integrate active Frisian- language skills and the educational skills
required to teach bilingual and multilingual children into their training courses for
teaching assistants, or to make them a compulsory part of the examination syllabus
(Covenant 2.4.2). The parties agreed that this objective will be realised by 2004.

In the Cove nant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will jointly encourage primary schools
to include in their plans for in-service training activities to train their teaching staff in
classroom and educational skills relating to the Frisian language and culture, if their
quality assurance policy reveals the need for such action (Covenant 2.4.3). The parties
agreed that this objective will be realised between 2004 and 2010.

6.47

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the province of Fryslân will pay attention
to the Frisian language and culture when developing projects in the field of cultural
education (Covenant 2.4.4). The parties agreed that this objective will be realised
between 2004 and 2010.

6.48

In order to guarantee that the regular professional educational support system
provides good supervision and support with regard to the teaching of Frisian, central
government and the province of Fryslân agreed that there will be an educational
support institution in the province of Fryslân funded jointly by the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science and the province of Fryslân. Within the existing
educational infrastructure for the teaching of the Frisian language and culture, this
institution will focus on providing support for bilingualism and multilingualism in
education generally and the Frisian language in particular. At the time the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) was entered into, that institution was the
GCO Fryslân organisation in Leeuwarden (Covenant 2.9.1). This support for the
teaching of Frisian focuses not only on primary education, but also on pre-school and
secondary education.

6.49

If the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the provincial executive of
Fryslân deem the provisions of article 2.9.1 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language
and Culture (2001) to be insufficient to achieve the objectives relating to the
supervision and support of the teaching of Frisian, they will consult together on
alternative ways of achieving them (Covenant 2.9.2).

6.50

To provide pupils with the ability to function in a bilingual society, section 9,
subsection 4 of the Primary Education Act 1998 requires all primary schools in the
province of Fryslân to teach Frisian as a compulsory subject for all pupils, unless the
provincial executive of Fryslân has granted an exemption.

6.51

During the 1988-1989 school year, the provinc ial executive of Fryslân granted an
exemption from the statutory requirement to teach Frisian to approximately 10 per
cent of the 572 primary schools in the province of Fryslân. Since then, the policy of
the provincial executive of Fryslân has been aimed at gradually reducing the number
of exemptions.
During the 1999-2000 school year, there were 497 primary schools and 42 special
primary and/or secondary schools in the province of Fryslân. During the 2000-2001
school year, there were 495 primary schools and 12 special primary schools in the
province of Fryslân. Finally, during the 2001-2002 school year, there are 495 schools
and 11 special primary schools in the province of Fryslân. 128 At present, the

128

See http://www.fryslan.nl/html-ned/teksten/FIC_nl_onderwijs.htm (28 March 2002).

42

provincial executive of Fryslân has only granted an exemp tion, pursuant to section 9,
subsection 4 of the Primary Education Act, to eleven of the twelve primary schools
located on the Frisian Islands. The primary schools in Ooststellingwerf and
Weststellingwerf did not receive exemptions, but have chosen to devote attention to
both the Stellingwerf dialect and Frisian in the framework of the study of local history
and culture. In comparison to the 1988-1989 school year, the number of exemptions
for 2000-2001 has dropped from 10 per cent to just over 2 per cent.
6.52

Section 9 of the Primary Education Act 1998 lists the subjects that all primary schools
are required to teach. There are no statutory provisions regarding the manner in which
these subjects are to be taught or the amount of time that is to be devoted to each of
them, but attainment targets have been set for all compulsory subjects, and thus also
for Frisian, by means of an order in council (see section 6.3). Each school can choose
how to integrate Frisian into its curriculum and must justify its decision in the school
plan. The Primary Education Act 1998 stipulates that these school plans must also
contain an explanation of each school’s quality assurance policies. Schools are
required to produce a school plan every four years (see sections 12 and 16 of the
Primary Education Act 1998).

6.53

Section 9, subsection 8 of the Primary Education Act 1998 provides that primary
schools in the province of Fryslân may use Frisian as their language of instruction.
A recent Education Inspectorate report indicates that 56 per cent of primary schools
use Frisian as their language of instruction for subjects other than Frisian. In
comparison with 1988, the use of Frisian as a language of instruction has declined
slightly. 129

6.54

As a result of the second Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (1993) and
by Act of 4 July 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 403), section 100, subsection 2 of
the Primary Education Act 1981 and section 97, subsection 2 of the Special Education
Interim Act provide that central government shall reimburse the province of Fryslân
for the annual cost of maintaining Frisian- language education. The province of
Fryslân is responsible for the distribution of these funds to the schools on the basis of
the number of pupils receiving Frisian- language education. In 1997, the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science provided NLG 450,000 (€204,201) for this purpose.
This amount has since been index- linked and stands at €224,000 for 2002. 130
The provision concerning the annual reimbursement of the cost of maintaining
Frisian- language education was incorporated in section 134, subsection 2 of the
Primary Education Act 1998. The Special Education Interim Act has meanwhile been
superseded by the Expertise Centres Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1998, 496),
which contains no separate funding for Frisian. The expertise centres are discussed in
greater depth in sections 6.57 and 6.58.

6.55

129

130

In addition to the above- mentioned reimbursement of the cost of maintaining Frisianlanguage education, the province of Fryslân also receives an annual specific-purpose
grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to safeguard and improve
the position of Frisian within education, on the basis of the Covenant on the Frisian

Education Inspectorate, Het onderwijs in het Fries op de basisscholen in Friesland. De stand van zaken,
Utrecht 2001, 26-27.

Language and Culture (2001) (Covenant 2.3.1). This specific-purpose grant for
Frisian is not only intended for primary education, but may be used for a wide range
of purposes, including pre-school education, primary and secondary education,
educational support, and initial and in-service teacher training. In 2001, the grant
amounted to €650,450. The grant is index-linked to wage and price developments.
Central government also awarded a one-off payment of €68,000 to increase the level
of support for Frisian in education. In addition to the specific-purpose grant from the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the province of Fryslân annually provides
a further €204,200. Total support for Frisian-language education thus amounted to
€922,714 in 2001, 131 of which the GCO Fryslân foundation received €340,355. 132 The
two colleges of higher professional education in Fryslân, the Christian College of
Higher Professional Education of the Northern Netherlands and the Northern College
of Higher Professional Education in Leeuwarden, each received €34,033 for the initial
and in-service training of teachers of Frisian. Finally, in addition to the abovementioned specific-purpose grant, a certain proportion of central government
resources for the educational opportunity policy can also be allocated in support of
Frisian as a subject and as a language of instruction, but only in those primary schools
that fall under the educational opportunity policy (see sections 6.59 to 6.61).
6.56

As of 1998, some special schools that previously fell under the Special Education
Interim Act now fall under the Primary Education Act 1998. The schools concerned
are the MLK and LOM schools, that is to say, schools for children with learning
difficulties and schools for children with learning and behavioural difficulties. Since
1998, these schools must therefore also comply with the statutory provisions that
apply in all primary schools in the province of Fryslân with regard to the teaching of
Frisian. Neither the Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ nor the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001) devote any attention to MLK and LOM schools.
A specific reference is not strictly necessary in the case of the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture, however, as MLK and LOM schools fall under the measures
adopted in relation to mainstream primary schools in the province of Fryslân. It is up
to the province to operationalise these measures, in consultation with the education
sector.

6.57

As of 1998, other special schools that previously fell under the Special Education
Interim Act now fall under the new Expertise Centres Act (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1998, 496). Children with severe learning difficulties (ZMLK) and children
with physical, visual or other disabilities follow a form of special education that falls
under the Expertise Centres Act, which differentiates between four types of schools
providing special primary and secondary education, namely:
•
schools for children with visual disabilities (blind and partially sighted
children and children with multiple disabilities)
•
schools for children with hearing and communication disabilities (deaf and
partially deaf children, children with multiple disabilities and children with
severe speech impediments)
•
schools for children with physical and mental disabilities
•
schools for children with behavioural and psychiatric problems.

131

132

Not including the resources available for pre-school education, which amount to €122,500 during the 20002004 period.
With regard to GCO Fryslân, see sections 6.48 and 6.49.

44

6.58

Schools falling under the Expertise Centres Act are allowed to use Frisian as a
language of instruction and offer Frisian as a subject (sections 13, subsection 6 and
18, subsection 1 of the Expertise Centres Act). 133 In practice, however, this happens
rarely, if at all. Section 5.5 of the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ focuses on
schools that fall under the Expertise Centres Act. According to the province’s action
plan, these schools should draw up language policies addressing the manner in which
they link up with the pupils’ home language in education, objectives for the teaching
of Frisian and the manner in which they maintain professional standards in relation to
Frisian or bilingual education (see also Covenant 2.6). 134

6.59

In order to tackle educational disadvantage in primary schools, the Ministry of
Education, Culture and Science issued a policy document on educational
opportunities in June 2000. 135 Under the educational opportunity policy,
municipalities, school boards and schools work closely together. In consultation with
the Education Inspectorate, these organisations make specific agreements at local
level to improve the educational achievement of pupils. The educational opportunity
policy initially focused on schools in large and medium-sized municipalities and was
subsequently extended to small towns and rural municipalities, starting with a pilot
project for cooperation between municipalities in the province of Zeeland. Other
provinces, including the province of Fryslân, are now also involved in the
implementation of this policy.

6.60

Information provided to the House of Representatives by the government indicates
that 13 municipalities in Fryslân are cooperating for the benefit of 20 educational
opportunity schools. 136 The project initially focuses on carrying out a preliminary
assessment of the situation in the schools, based on Education Inspectorate reports,
and then determines which specific issues require attention. The following issues are
regarded as applying to all the schools in the area in question:
•
the minimum amount of training required to deliver quality education
(problem of small schools);
•
command of the Dutch and Frisian languages;
•
transfer to secondary education; and
•
the rise in the number of referrals to special schools for primary education.

6.61

At the request of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the province of
Fryslân has developed an action plan for the educational opportunity project for
primary schools in Frisian municipalities, with the exception of Leeuwarden. 137 The
province’s plan distinguishes between four potential regional issues, including the
command of the Dutch and Frisian languages. The key question on the issue of
language is: ‘Under what circumstances would it be possible to organise bilingual
primary education in such a manner that pupils at educational opportunity schools
also achieve good results in Dutch and Frisian?’ 138 The plan is to be implemented

133

134
135
136

137
138

In Fryslân, this concerns a total of 14 schools, of which one is a school for children with hearing and
communication disabilities, eleven are schools for children with physical and mental disabilities and two
are schools for children with behavioural and psychiatric problems.

between 2002 and 2006. A school-specific approach applies to the 20 participating
schools mentioned in the previous paragraph. In addition, there will be nine follow-up
schools. The project requires €1.36 million in funding, which will be provided in its
entirety by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science.
6.62

In the framework of the European Charter, the Dutch government undertook to report
periodically on measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing
the teaching of the Frisian language, as well as to draw up periodic reports (Article
8(1)(i) of the European Charter). In 2001, the Education Inspectorate published a
report regarding Frisian- language education at primary schools in Fryslân. The report
addresses a number of issues, including the attainment targets for Dutch and Frisian
that apply to primary schools in Fryslân. These attainment targets, which were set in
1998 (see sections 6.3 and 6.4), describe the knowledge and skills that pupils must
develop to be able to use both languages effectively in everyday situations. In
practice, they imply that pupils must be able to understand, speak, read and write both
languages – Frisian and Dutch – by the time they leave primary school. The
Education Inspectorate’s 2001 report notes that the amount of time currently invested
in primary education in the Frisian language is insufficient for achieving the
attainment targets. 139

6.63

The Education Inspectorate’s 2001 report also notes that remarkably little attention is
devoted to differentiation (the act of distinguishing between pupils according to their
language level) and transposal (the application of skills learnt in other subjects to the
teaching of Frisian) in lessons. In fact, differentiation was applied in only 29 per cent
of the lessons evaluated, and transposal in only 31 per cent. The lack of differentiation
is particularly remarkable, as teachers are aware of the home language of their pupils
in over 95 per cent of all cases. Furthermore, it is remarkable that over a third of
teachers are not familiar with the previous year’s Frisian teaching materials. In fact,
only 25 per cent of schools keep track of pupil development in Frisian. 140 Most
primary schools use the textbooks developed by GCO Fryslân, entitled ‘De Fryske
Taalrotonde’. However, research by the Fryske Akademy indicates that these
textbooks are often not used in a systematic manner. 141 In its report, the Education
Inspectorate concluded that the quality of teaching was insufficient in 71 per cent of
the Frisian lessons evaluated and that only 26 per cent of schools possessed teaching
materials that complied with the attainment targets. 142

6.64

In response to the above-mentioned report of the Education Inspectorate, the
government informed the House of Representatives in a letter dated 10 September
2001 that it does not support a lowering of the attainment targets. 143 However, the

pupils and the use of Frisian as a language of instruction. See Annemarie van Langen and Madeleine

46

government did ask the committee on attainment targets to examine the attainment
targets for Frisian from the perspective of applying skills learnt in the pursuit of the
attainment targets for Dutch. The purpose of this exercise is to achieve greater
coherence between education in Frisian and Dutch, at least in relation to the
attainment targets.
6.65

Furthermore, in a follow- up letter dated 3 April 2002, the government informed the
House of Representatives that central government will decide general education
policy and be directly or indirectly responsible for ensuring compliance with the
European Charter as regards the Frisian language, while the province of Fryslân will
decide policies on the Frisian language and be responsible for ensuring that they are
implemented. 144 Central government will provide the province of Fryslân with
funding for the implementation of policies on the Frisian language (see section 6.55).
These basic principles are consistent with the agreements reached on these matters in
the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (chapter
2).
The above- mentioned principles are addressed in greater depth in the action points
that appear in the Covenant. These action points indicate which tasks belong to the
province, which belong to central government and which are carried out jointly. The
action points appear in the various sections of the Covenant and serve as a guideline
for the implementation of the agreements. According to the State Secretary for
Education, Culture and Science, in a letter dated 3 April 2002 to the House of
Representatives, this proves that central government retains independent
responsibility with regard to Frisian in education.

6.66

The follow-up letter of 3 April 2002 also discusses the Committee of Experts’ report
on the implementation of the European Charter in the Netherlands. 145 The letter notes
that the conclusions of the report of the Committee of Experts, which was established
by the Council of Europe, are in harmony with the conclusions of the Education
Inspectorate’s 2001 report, entitled ‘Het onderwijs in het Fries op de basisscholen in
Friesland’. In response to this report, central government and the province of Fryslân
had already reached agreement on a number of supplementary initiatives for primary
education, which were then incorporated in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001). According to the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science,
these supplementary initiatives include measures that address the shortcomings
identified by the Committee of Experts.

6.67

The various problems concerning the achievement of the attainment targets for Frisian
(see sections 6.63 and 6.64) have been recognised in Fryslân for some time. Thus, in
June 1999, the Berie foar it Frysk, the province of Fryslân’s advisory body on
language policy, advised the provincial executive of Fryslân to maintain the existing
attainment targets, but at the same time to develop a flexible policy on exemptions.
This would enable the provincial executive of Fryslân to be more flexible with regard

to primary schools in its use of the statutory exemption instrument provided under
section 9, subsection 4 of the Primary Education Act 1998 (see section 6.50). Schools
could thus obtain a temporary exemption with regard to some of the attainment targets
for Frisian. 146 The province of Fryslân incorporated the recommendation of the Berie
foar it Frysk into the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, a draft version of which
was published in 2001 (see sections 3.7.15 and 6.21).
6.68

In order to realise the attainment targets for Dutch, Frisian and English in primary
education, the Taalsintrum Frysk language centre (part of GCO Fryslân) and the
Fryske Akademy launched a trilingual schools project in 1997. Seven primary schools
in Fryslân are currently participating in this project and are using Dutch, Frisian and
English as their languages of instruction. In years 1 to 6 (ages four to nine) Frisian
and Dutch are used in equal measure as the languages of instruction, in years 7 and 8
(ages ten to twelve) English is added as the third language of instruction. The
distribution of the languages of instruction in the last two years of primary education
is 40 per cent Frisian, 40 per cent Dutch and 20 per cent English. 147 During the 20032004 school year, the participating primary schools will start dealing with education
in three languages, as the first group of pupils concerned will have entered year 7.

6.69

In 1998, on the instructions of and in cooperation with GCO Fryslân, the National
Institute for Educational Measurement developed a Frisian reading test for primary
schools, known as the Twa-Minute-Toets (TMT). The development costs of the test
amounted to NLG 21,760, and the foundation received 500 copies of the test. 148
According to the foundation, however, the test has hardly been used in practice.

6.70

In summary, it is clear that a majority of primary schools in the province of Fryslân
comply with the statutory requirement to teach Frisian. The Education Inspectorate’s
2001 report indicates that a majority of primary schools dedicate 30 to 45 minutes per
week to Frisian in years 3 to 5. This means that the amount of time dedicated to
Frisian in these years has remained unchanged since 1988-1989. The report has also
identified an increase in the amount of time dedicated to Frisian in the upper years
(years 6 to 8) from 30-45 minutes per week in 1988 to an hour or more in 2001. On
average, primary schools dedicate 25 minutes per week to the Frisian language. 149 At
the same time, the Education Inspectorate’s report indicates that the quality of Frisianlanguage primary education remains far from satisfactory: schools have not developed
language policies, teaching materials do not meet the attainment targets and the
lessons of many teachers are of poor quality. 150

6.71

The province of Fryslân’s ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ recognises these
problems. The aim of the province’s action plan is to help primary schools meet
existing attainment targets for Frisian in the future. In this context, it is vital that the
schools draw up a language policy plan, which should involve the creation of a

specific step-by-step plan regarding the classroom and educational skills involved in
teaching Frisian. These language policy plans should always cover a three- year
period, and the status of Frisian as a subject should be evaluated on an annual basis.151
The ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ also announced that the province of
Fryslân will in due course consider the recommendation of the Berie foar it Frysk to
adopt a system of partial exemptions from the attainment targets for Frisian (see
section 6.67). As previously noted, the action plan contributes to the implementation
of the province’s undertakings under the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) (see section 6.21).
6.72

The undertakings of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, as described in
the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), are aimed at implementing
the recommendations drawn up by the Council of Europe. Thus, central government
contributes to the establishment of the teaching of Frisian in primary schools by
funding the cost of maintaining Frisian- language education and by awarding a
specific-purpose grant to safeguard and develop the position of Frisian in education
(see sections 6.54 and 6.55). Furthermore, central government will ensure that the
Education Inspectorate will publish a three- yearly report on the status of bilingual and
multilingual education in the province of Fryslân (see section 6.187).

Article 8(1)(c)(iii): secondary education

6.73

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to provide, within
secondary education, for the teaching of the [Frisian language] as an integral part of the
curriculum.’ The complex structure of secondary education in the Netherlands – basic
secondary education and the various school types – is discussed at the beginning of this
chapter. For the sake of brevity, the reader is referred to sections 6.5 to 6.9.

6.74

During the process that led to the acceptance of the European Charter, the Dutch
government opted for the above-cited subparagraph iii, not subparagraph ii, in relation
to secondary education. The government made the following observation in relation to
subparagraphs ii and iii: ‘Article 8(1)(c)(ii) of the Charter implies that Frisian should
become the language of instruction for a substantial part of secondary education, while
Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of the Charter concerns the teaching of the relevant regional or
minority language as a separate subject.’ 152 The government also pointed out that
schools are in fact free to choose whether to use Frisian as the language of instruction.
Such a choice will depend on local and regional circumstances.

6.75

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that, in the Netherlands, secondary
education initially follows a programme of basic secondary education, before
continuing with the second stage of secondary education. Basic secondary education,
which may be regarded as an orientation period, can last between two and four years,
depend ing on the pupil’s abilities. According to existing education legislation, the
teaching of Frisian is obligatory in basic secondary education, whereas it is only an
optional subject during the second stage of secondary education. 153

6.76

The Committee of Experts further notes that schools offering Frisian only teach it for
one year at the level of basic secondary education. This makes it impossible to
achieve the attainment targets, which happen to be identical to the attainment targets
for the Dutch language. Furthermore, because Frisian is offered only in the first year
of basic secondary education and in the final year of the second stage of secondary
education, a large gap is created in the intervening years. As a result, pupils often
refrain from choosing Frisian as an optional subject for their school- leaving
examinations in the last year of the second stage. During the 1996-1997 school year,
only fourteen pupils chose Frisian as an optional subject for their school- leaving
examinations. This low number is also ascribed to the low quality of teaching, a lack
of interest on the part of teachers, parents and the pupils themselves and insufficient
teaching materials. 154

6.77

The Committee of Experts considers that the undertaking entered into by the
Netherlands is not being fulfilled. 155 The Committee encourages the government to
take the necessary steps to improve the present position of Frisian and the quality of
Frisian lessons in secondary education. In this regard, it is worth noting that a number
of secondary schools in the province of Fryslân have recently launched a project that
is meant to tackle the problems identified in the preceding paragraph. As a result, the
number of pupils choosing Frisian as an optional subject for their school- leaving
examinations has already increased significantly (see sections 6.101 and 6.102).

6.78

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân concluded various agreements to improve the position of
Frisian in secondary education. With regard to the attainment targets for Frisian in
basic secondary education, the parties agreed that, subject to any statutory
amendments consequent on the results of the Education Inspectorate’s 1999
evaluation of basic secondary education, central government will include attainment
targets for Frisian in the Basic Secondary Education (Attainment Targets and
Recommended Number of Periods per Subject 2003-2010) Decree (Covenant 2.5.1).
In addition, central government and the province of Fryslân agreed that they will
together strive to ensure that all schools that are not exempted achieve the attainment
targets for Frisian in basic secondary education and have sufficient (multimedia)
material and qualified teachers to enable them to do this (Covenant 2.5.6). The parties
agreed that this objective will be fulfilled between 2004 and 2010.

6.79

In the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân also concluded a number of specific
agreements concerning the position of Frisian in the second stage of secondary
education. Towards 2003, first of all, when the fixed subject combinations for the
second stage of secondary education are being reviewed, central government will
consider whether there is any reason to bring the pre-university education (VWO)
examination syllabus into line with the senior general secondary education (HAVO)
examination syllabus (Frisian 1 and Frisian 2) (Covenant 2.5.2). In addition, central
government and the province of Fryslân will jointly strive to increase pupils’ interest
in Frisian so that more of them opt to take it as an exam subject (Covenant 2.5.4). The
parties agreed that this objective will be realised by 2004. Finally, central government

154
155

Ibid., 65.

50

and the province of Fryslân will jointly encourage the development of an annual
international exchange with other minority languages in Europe as an optional part of
the syllabus for pupils opting for Frisian as a full examination subject. Relevant
materials will also be developed (Covenant 2.5.8). The parties agreed that this
objective will be realised by 2010.
6.80

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) also focuses on the quality
of Frisian lessons in secondary education. First of all, central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed that both parties will jointly encourage secondary schools
that include Frisian in their syllabus and use it as a language of instruction to
implement quality assurance policies in this respect. The instruments available to
schools for this purpose will be reviewed to see whether they are suitable for use in
relation to Frisian; where necessary they will be modified, and information about
them will be offered to the schools (Covenant 2.5.5). In addition, the parties agreed
that they will jointly encourage secondary schools to include training in classroom
and educational skills relating to the Frisian language and culture in their plans for inservice training activities, if their quality assurance policies reveal the need for such
action (Covenant 2.5.7). The parties agreed that both objectives will be realised by
2004.

6.81

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân also agreed that the province will ensure that attention is paid
to Frisian language and culture when developing projects in the field of cultural
education (Covenant 2.5.9). The parties agreed that this objective will be realised by
2010.

6.82

In the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân further agreed that both parties will consider
in 2004 what action may be required to improve the position of Frisian in secondary
education. Such action may then be included in the second implementation covenant
for the 2004-2007 period. This agreement focuses specifically, though not
exclusively, on the attainment targets for Frisian in basic secondary education
(Covenant 2.5.3).

6.83

With regard to the position of Frisian as a subject in secondary education, this report
first considers basic secondary education, that is to say, the lower forms of secondary
education (sections 6.84 to 6.98). Section 6.98 takes stock of the position of Frisian in
basic secondary education. The report then considers the position of Frisian as a
subject in the upper forms of pre-vocational secondary education (VMBO) and in the
second stage of secondary education, that is to say, senior general secondary
education (HAVO) and pre-university education (VWO) (sections 6.99 to 6.106).
Finally, the report considers the use of Frisian as a language of instruction in
secondary education, both in basic secondary education and beyond (sections 6.107
and 6.108). In conclusion, section 6.109 provides a synoptic evaluation of the position
of Frisian in secondary education as a whole.

6.84

With the introduction of basic secondary education in 1993, Frisian became the
sixteenth compulsory subject for the lower forms of secondary schools in the province
of Fryslân (section 11a, subsection 2 (b) of the Secondary Education Act). This was
the first time that Frisian became a compulsory subject in secondary schools in

51

Fryslân, albeit only in the lower forms, that is to say, in basic secondary education.
Section 11a of the Secondary Education Act regulates the syllabus and the attainment
targets of basic secondary education. With regard to the teaching of Dutch and Frisian
in schools in Fryslân, section 11a, subsection 2 (b) of the Act provides as follows:
‘The Dutch language may be understood as including the Frisian language. Basic
education in secondary schools in the province of Fryslân shall include the teaching of
the Frisian language, unless the inspector concerned has granted a full or partial
exemption from this requirement at the request of the competent authority.’ This
statutory provision regarding the teaching of Frisian was described as ‘insubstantial’
during the parliamentary discussion of the Basic Secondary Education Bill, as it
allows schools to request exemptions from the teaching of Frisian. To exacerbate
matters, the Education Inspectorate does little to test the validity of such requests. 156
6.85

A number of secondary schools have requested and obtained the exemption described
in the preceding paragraph. As a result, according to the Education Inspectorate, more
than one in three secondary schools in Fryslân did not offer Frisian as a subject in
1997-1998. In fact, schools enjoying a full exemption accounted for 37.5 per cent of
all educational establishments in Fryslân. If the total number of educational
establishments is considered, however, it emerges that one in four (22 per cent) did
not offer Frisian as a subject. 157

6.86

The Education Inspectorate recommends adopting the approach used in primary
education in relation to the exemption procedure for basic secondary education. In its
advisory report, the Berie foar it Frysk agrees with the Education Inspectorate on this
issue. The Education Inspectorate and the Berie foar it Frysk both recommend that the
authority to grant exemptions should be vested in the provincial executive, as is
currently the case with regard to primary education. In this manner, the role of the
government (regulation) and the role of the Education Inspectorate (supervision) will
remain clearly separated. 158

6.87

With the statutory regulation of the position of Frisian in basic secondary education,
the Netherlands has formally complied with its undertaking to provide for the teaching
of the Frisian language as an integral part of the curriculum, in accordance with the
relevant provision of the European Charter. Schools receive no additional funding for
the teaching of Frisian, however, as the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is of
the opinion that the costs can be covered from the regular funding of the schools
concerned. In fact, the specific-purpose grant for improving the quality of Frisianlanguage education also applies to Frisian in basic secondary education (see section
6.55).

6.88

In 1993, the government first established attainment targets for basic secondary
education by means of an order in council. Since then, the government has also

established new attainment targets for the 1998-2003 period. 159 No statutory attainment
targets were established for Frisian in basic secondary education, however, although
guidelines corresponding to the attainment targets for Dutch were published in the
bulletin of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. 160 The National Institute for
Educational Measurement has developed final tests for Frisian in basic secondary
education and has sent them to all secondary schools in Fryslân. These tests are based
on the 1993 attainment targets. 161
6.89

Between 1993 and 1996, central government and the province of Fryslân employed a
coordinator of Frisian in basic secondary education to supervise the introduction of
Frisian as a subject in basic secondary education. The coordinator submitted two reports
to the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. In response to the second report, the
State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science chose to wait for the Education
Inspectorate’s report before deciding whether additional measures were required with
regard to Frisian in basic secondary education. During the same period, secondary
school teachers were entitled to take a course, designed by the National Intermediary
Education and Training Organisation, at the Northern College of Higher Professional
Education in Leeuwarden to obtain a grade two teaching qualification in Frisian. In
addition, central government provided funding for the development of the ‘Flotwei
Frysk’ textbooks for the Frisian language (see section 6.90). 162

6.90

The development of teaching materials for Frisian as a subject in basic secondary
education has meanwhile continued. The ‘Flotwei Frysk’ textbooks, which were
developed by GCO Fryslân with the help of grants from the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Science and the European Commission, have existed since 1995. 163 Besides
the children’s magazine ‘Sjedêrrr!!!’, which is also produced by the GCO Fryslân
foundation, the ‘Flotwei Frysk’ textbooks are the most widely used in basic secondary
education. In addition, schools make use of the educational television and radio
programmes of the Omrop Fryslân broadcasting organisation. Finally, 36 per cent of
teachers occasionally use one of the literary anthologies published by the Algemiene
Fryske Underrjocht Kommisje (AFUK). The Education Inspectorate has noted that
schools devoting one teaching period per week to Frisian during the first year of basic
secondary education will have difficulty completing the ‘Flotwei Frysk’ textbooks,
which requires at least one teaching period per week for a period of three years. 164

6.91

The Education Inspectorate’s 1999 report on Frisian in basic secondary education
concludes that the amount of Frisian in basic secondary education provides too small a
contribution to the development of fluency in and knowledge of Frisian (see section
6.7). Too few attainment targets are being achieved in a satisfactory manner, and the

lenient attitude towards the Frisian- language syllabus (no mandatory attainment targets
and therefore no teaching periods in the table showing the recommended number of
periods per subject) and the general availability of just one teaching period per week
(and often only during the first year) do little to improve the quality of what is on
offer. 165 Frisian-language departments in secondary schools often consist of just one
teacher who is not qualified to teach Frisian and was appointed to teach other subjects.
In fact, it is not even possible to speak of a department in most cases. As a result, the
registration and assessment of pupil progress is extremely poor. 166
6.92

The Education Inspectorate’s 1999 report on Frisian in basic secondary education also
notes that Frisian exams are infrequent and poor in quality. The National Institute for
Educational Measurement has developed final tests for Frisian (see section 6.88), but
the status of these exams is unclear. Strictly speaking, the sub ject falls under the
requirement stipulated in section 11a, subsection 5 of the Secondary Education Act.167
However, due to the non-mandatory character of the attainment targets (guidelines) and
the limited amount of time that schools have available, it is almost impossible to meet
this requirement. The Education Inspectorate has advised the government to clarify
whether offering Frisian as an optional subject in basic secondary education complies
with the relevant statutory requirement. In addition, the Education Inspectorate has
advised the government to tailor the guidelines for Frisian to the available teaching time
and to carry out a technical study of the requirements for Frisian- language education to
determine the extent to which schools can increase the amount of Frisian offered under
existing regulatory and budgetary conditions. 168

6.93

In its advisory report of October 2001 (see section 6.7), the Education Council
recommended grouping the attainment targets into a core curriculum and an optional
curriculum. The Education Inspectorate made the same recommendation. The
Education Council would like to place the Frisian language in the optional curriculum,
together with German, French and the classical languages. 169

6.94

The government has decided that it is impossible to introduce a core curriculum and an
optional curriculum in the short term. To meet the needs of secondary schools,
however, it introduced a number of temporary measures on 1 August 2001.170 For
example, schools may now choose between the attainment targets (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 2001, 340). This measure has no particular implications for the attainment
targets for Frisian, however, since the latter serve merely as a guideline and are not, as
previously noted, prescribed by law.

6.95

At present, the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is in the process of
evaluating basic secondary education. 171 The government intends to introduce the
recommended changes in basic secondary education as of 1 August 2004.172 In doing

so, it will adopt the recommendation of the Education Council and the Education
Inspectorate to place Frisian in the optional curriculum. However, in a letter dated 4
March 2002 to the House of Representatives, the State Secretary for Education, Culture
and Science indicated that the freedom of choice of secondary schools regarding the
development of the optional curriculum would be restricted by the relevant provision of
the European Charter concerning the position of Frisian within secondary education in
the province of Frys lân. 173
6.96

In a letter dated 12 April 2002, the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science
announced the establishment of a taskforce on basic secondary education. One of the
missions of this taskforce will be to formulate attainment targets for the core
curriculum, on the basis of the existing attainment targets and their use by schools in
relation to the syllabus of the upper forms and the examination syllabus (see section
3.7.8).174 The above- mentioned letter, which includes a detailed description of the
taskforce’s duties, does not indicate whether the taskforce will be responsible for
implementing the agreements on the attainment targets for Frisian concluded in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see section 6.78). The
Parliamentary Papers on the evaluation of basic secondary education also fail to
indicate how these agreements will be implemented.

6.97

The agreements reached in the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) are designed to bring the current state of affairs in secondary education
into harmony with the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under the Charter.
Through the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis´, the province of Fryslân is seeking
to implement the undertakings it entered into under the Covenant. With regard to basic
secondary education, the province’s action plan indicates that the provincial executive
will seek to encourage every secondary school in Fryslân to draw up a language policy
plan within the next two years. This language policy plan should identify the relevant
attainment targets and establish methods for dealing with differences between pupils,
with regard to fluency as well as attitudes towards the Frisian language. According to
the province’s action plan, all schools must complete a model curriculum for Frisian
and bilingual secondary education within a year. 175 In addition, within three years, each
language policy plan must be supplemented by a policy plan regarding the position of
Frisian as a language of instruction for other subjects. In accordance with section 6a of
the Secondary Education Act, these policy plans should also include a code of conduct
concerning the use of the Frisian language, drawn up by the competent authority of
each school (see section 6.107). The “Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ was
approved by The the provincial council of Fryslân approved the Plan fan Oanpak Frysk
yn it Underwiis during the course ofin 2002.

6.98

In summary, it is clear that statutory measures have been taken to offer Frisian as a
regular subject in basic secondary education, in accordance with the European
Charter. According to the Education Inspectorate’s report, however, the current state
of affairs in secondary education is not consistent with the undertaking entered into by
the Netherlands to provide for the teaching of Frisian as an integral part of the
curriculum in secondary education in the province of Fryslân.

In October 2001, the Education Council published an advisory report on changes in
basic secondary education, in which it recommended placing Frisian in the optional
curriculum. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science has heeded the council’s
recommendation, and structural changes will probably be implemented in August
2004. In the meantime, schools may choose between the attainment targets as a
temporary solution to their main problems. Around the time of the reference date of
this report (spring 2002), the implementation of the agreements concerning the
position of Frisian in basic secondary education, as concluded in the framework of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), still required further
elaboration at national and provincial level.
6.99

The second stage of senior general secondary education (HAVO) and pre- university
education (VWO) and the upper forms of pre- vocational secondary education
(VMBO), in their current form, were introduced on 1 August 1998. A number of
problems have since become apparent in the education programme for HAVO and
VWO, including overloading and fragmentation of the curriculum and a lack of
coherence and coordination between practical assignments. 176 In August 2000, the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Science introduced a number of temporary
measures to lighten the curriculum, in order to allow schools to solve problems
relating to the introduction of the second stage. 177 In a memorandum on continuity
and innovation in the second stage of HAVO and VWO, the State Secretary for
Education, Culture and Science made a number of recommendatio ns for structural
changes in the second stage, which will probably not be introduced before 2005. Until
then, it therefore makes sense to extend the temporary mitigatory measures. 178

6.100 Schools are allowed, but not required, to offer Frisian as an optional subject in the
second stage of secondary education. In addition, pupils in VWO, HAVO and VMBO
are free to choose Frisian as an examination subject. 179 These and other matters are
regulated by the school- leaving examinations decree for secondary education (see
sections 6.103 to 6.105). Obviously, pupils are only able to choose Frisian if the
school concerned, where necessary in cooperation with other schools, offers it as an
optional subject.
6.101 A limited number of secondary schools offers Frisian as an examination subject
during the final year of studies. In 2001, 25 pupils in junior general secondary
education (MAVO), 41 pupils in HAVO and 20 pupils in VWO took the Frisian
school- leaving examination. In 2000, the figures were 29 for MAVO, 35 for HAVO
and 12 for VWO. In 1999, the figures were 21, 6 and 2 respectively. 180
6.102 In order to offer a Frisian exam syllabus for HAVO and VWO in more schools than is
currently the case, the province of Fryslân has provided an incentive grant of NLG
180,000 (€80,865) for experiments at four combined schools for secondary education

in Fryslân since 1997-1998. 181 The aim of the project is to encourage pupils to choose
Frisian as an examination subject and to generate a more positive attitude towards
Frisian among pupils and teachers. GCO Fryslân is advising the schools that are
involved in the project by helping them to draw up a language policy plan and by
alerting them to the importance of continuity, as schools frequently offer Frisian
during the first year of studies and as an examination subject, but fail to offer it in the
intervening years. The Committee of Experts also noted this interruption in the
teaching of Frisian and described it as one of the causes of the low number of pupils
choosing Frisian as an examination subject (see section 6.76).
The above- mentioned project will last five years and reaches its final stage during the
2002-2003 school year. The achievements of the project will be published during the
course of 2003. In the meantime, it already appears that more fifth- form HAVO
pupils have taken the Frisian school- leaving examination in the four participating
schools (26 in 1999-2000 and 43 in 2000-2001), although a similar increase has not
occurred in VWO. 182
In the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, the province of Fryslân recommends
introducing a similar project for VMBO. It intends to allocate €45,380 a year for this
purpose for a period of three years. 183
6.103 The amended VWO-HAVO-MAVO-VBO (Organisation of Teaching) Decree and
VWO-HAVO-MAVO-VBO Leaving Examinations Decree entered into force on 1
August 1998. The changes introduced concern the second stage of HAVO and VWO
and the upper forms of VMBO. The Secondary Education (Organisation of Teaching)
Decree was adopted in May 1999 in connection with the new learning pathways in
MAVO and VBO (VMBO) (see section 6.9). The Leaving Examinations Decree was
subsequently adopted in March 2000. Secondary schools in the province of Fryslân
are not legally obliged to offer Frisian as an examination subject, but they have the
option, where necessary in cooperation with other schools, of offering Frisian as an
optional examination subject.
6.104 Article 26b, paragraph 5 (a) of the VWO-HAVO-MAVO-VBO (Organisation of
Teaching) Decree and the VWO-HAVO-MAVO-VBO Leaving Examinations Decree,
lists Frisian language and literature as one of the subjects that can be chosen as part of
the specialised component of the VWO subject combination Culture and Society. In
addition, article 26b, paragraph 7 (a) stipulates that Frisian language and literature can
be part of the optional component of all four VWO subject combinations (see section
6.8).
Article 26c, paragraph 1 (a) of the Secondary Education (Organisation of Teaching)
Decree lists Frisian language and literature 1 as a half-subject that can be chosen as
part of the common component of all HAVO subject combinations. Article 26c,
paragraph 1 (a) of the Decree lists Frisian as a possible choice of subject within the
subject combination Culture and Society, as a supplement to and in combination with

Frisian language and literature 1 and 2. In addition, the above- mentioned elements can
be offered as part of the optional component of all HAVO subject combinations.
The Leaving Examinations Decree is linked to the subject combinations. Frisian
language and literature will therefore remain as an optional examination subject.
6.105 The Leaving Examinations Decree of 24 March 2000 is linked to the various
programmes available in MAVO and VBO (VMBO). Article 22, paragraph 1 (c) of
the Decree lists the Frisian language as part of the optional component of the
theoretical programme. In addition, article 25, paragraph 1 (c) of the Decree lists the
Frisian language as part of the optional component of the combined theoretical and
vocational programme. Obviously, pupils are only able to take the Frisian schoolleaving examination if the school concerned offers Frisian as an optional subject.
6.106 In the draft ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, the provincial authority of
Fryslân recommends that all secondary schools, including VMBO schools, develop a
language policy within three years. It also recommends that they develop a model
curriculum for Frisian and bilingual secondary education, as well as a digital learning
environment for all final- year HAVO and VWO pupils, within a year. In 2000, the
province of Fryslân allocated the sum of NLG 80,000 (€36,300) for the development
of a digital learning environment. 184 As already mentioned, the aim of the ‘Plan fan
oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ is to implement the province’s undertakings under the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001). The province’s action plan
also focuses on Frisian as a language of instruction. For the use of Frisian as the
language of instruction in subjects other than Frisian, the approval of a linguistic code
of conduct by the competent authority in the school is required by law (see section
6.107).
6.107 Section 4.46 of the first Dutch periodic report to the Council of Europe, which took 1
March 1998 as its reference date, indicated that there existed no legal impediment to
the use of Frisian as a language of instruction in secondary schools in the province of
Fryslân, either in basic secondary education or thereafter. Since then, a provision
prescribing the use of Dutch as the language of instruction in secondary education and
during examinations has been included in the Secondary Education Act. This
provision came into force on 1 August 1998.
According to section 6a of the Secondary Education Act, however, another language
can be used:
•
where the teaching of that language is concerned, or
•
if the particular character, organisation or quality of the education, or the
origin of the participants, requires as much, in accordance with a code of
conduct approved by the competent authority.
Under this statutory regulation, the Frisian language can be used as the language of
instruction for the teaching of Frisian without the need for further regulation. In all
other cases, a code of conduct is required. However, as far as can be ascertained, no
secondary schools have yet adopted a code of conduct regarding the use of Frisian as
the language of instruction in other subjects.
184

6.108 No studies have recently been conducted into the use of Frisian as a language of
instruction in secondary education as a whole, although the Education Inspectorate’s
report on basic secondary education does devote attention to the use of Frisian as a
language of instruction during the initial years of secondary education. In practice,
Frisian is only used as a language of instruction for the teaching of Frisian, while in
oral and informal communication it is used only sporadically. Frisian is used mainly
in informal communication between teachers (64 per cent of teachers regularly use
Frisian amongst themselves) and in individual contacts between teachers and pupils
(43 per cent of teachers and pupils regularly use Frisian in individual contacts). The
Frisian language barely features in official written documents in the field of
education. In fact, with the exception of an occasional Frisian- language item in school
newspapers (43 per cent of the schools visited occasionally publish a Frisian- language
item in their school newspapers), the use of written Frisian is minimal. 185 These
figures are consistent with the fact that secondary schools in Fryslân have so far not
adopted linguistic codes of conduct.
6.109 In summary, it is clear that a significant number of statutory provisions aiming to
provide for the teaching of Frisian to all pupils as an integral part of the curriculum
have been adopted in the field of basic secondary education. However, the Education
Inspectorate’s 2001 report indicates that the implementation of these provisions is
insufficient. The legislature has established no mandatory requirements with regard to
the teaching of Frisian in the upper forms of secondary education, although the law
does enable schools to offer Frisian as an optional subject and as an examination
subject. In the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, the province of Fryslân
recommends a number of specific measures, including a project, to encourage the
teaching of Frisian in secondary schools. In this context, it is also worth considering
the use of Frisian as a language of instruction, while taking account of the provisions
of section 6a of the Secondary Education Act. Section 6.98 notes that the
implementation of the agreements concerning the position of Frisian in basic
secondary education, as included in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001), still required further elaboration at national and provincial level at the
time of the reference date of this report (spring 2002). This observation applies not
just to basic secondary education, but to secondary education as a whole.
Article 8(1)(e)(ii): university and other higher education

6.110 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to provide facilities
for the study of [the Frisian language] as a university and higher education subject’.
6.111 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that three colleges of higher professional
education are situated in the province of Fryslân. Frisian is included in teacher
training courses aimed at primary and secondary school teachers at two colleges. The
Committee further notes that Frisian is apparently not taught at the third college, the
Van Hall Institute, which specialises in nutrition, environment and agriculture.
Furthermore, Frisian language and literature can be studied at the Universities of
Groningen and Amsterdam. 186

also taught, as a subsidiary subject, at the University of Leiden (see section 6.126).

6.112 According to the information it has received, the Committee of Experts concludes that
there is no adequate funding to ensure a satisfactory level of teaching of Frisian at
colleges of higher professional education in Fryslân. This also partly accounts for the
fact that, outside the above- mentioned teacher training courses, there are no general
Frisian courses at these colleges. 187
6.113 The Committee of Experts considers that the undertaking entered into by the
Netherlands is being partially fulfilled. It therefore encourages the government to
pursue a more active approach with respect to the provision of facilities for the study
of the Frisian language in higher professional education. 188 Sections 6.129 and 6.130
of this report consider the Committee’s observations in greater depth. First, however,
the report provides a description of the current situation with regard to the teaching of
Frisian and Frisian language and literature at universities and colleges of higher
professional education.
6.114 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will jointly encourage closer contacts
between universities and colleges of higher professional education in Europe offering
courses in regional and minority languages and cultures. A framework plan and
materials will be developed for this purpose (Covenant 2.8.2). The parties agreed that
this objective will be realised by 2004.
6.115 With regard to the study of Frisian language and literature at Dutch universities,
central government and the province of Fryslân agreed as follows in the Covenant on
the Frisian Language and Culture (2001): ‘The Minister of Education, Culture and
Science will guarantee a basic level of funding for the study of Frisian language and
literature at a university. In concrete terms this will mean the continued existence, at
the University of Groningen, of a department offering a first-degree course (Covenant
2.8.3). The arrangements mentioned above for a degree course at the University of
Groningen are without prejudice to the possibility of a second first-degree course
being offered elsewhere. If and when a second such course is established, this will be
funded (wholly or partly) by the province of Fryslân on the basis of an agreement
with the university in question (Covenant 2.8.4).’
6.116 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that central government will encourage
institutions of higher education in Fryslân to include information in their annual
reports concerning their policies in relation to the use and promotion of the Frisian
language and culture (Covenant 2.8.5). The parties agreed that this objective will be
realised by 2004.
6.117 Finally, in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân agreed that the province of Fryslân will
encourage consultations with higher education institutions in Fryslân or elsewhere in
the Netherlands which teach Frisian to encourage them to include training in

classroom and educational skills relating to the Frisian language and culture in their
plans for in-service training activities (Covenant 2.8.6).
6.118 Fryslân has three colleges of higher professional education: the Christian College of
Higher Professional Education of the Northern Netherlands (CHN), the Northern
College of Higher Professional Education in Leeuwarden (NHL) and the Van Hall
Institute, which specialises in nutrition, environment and agriculture. In addition, the
Dutch Technical Teacher Training College has a branch in Leeuwarden. Together,
these colleges offer a wide range of courses, including teacher training, agriculture,
hotel management, business administration and public administration.
6.119 There are no universities in the province of Fryslân, although the universities of
Groningen, Twente and Wageningen allow students in certain courses to spend their
foundation year in Leeuwarden. In addition, the Open University operates a study
centre in Leeuwarden.
6.120 With regard to the study of Frisian language and literature at Dutch universities, it is
worth noting that in 1999 the heads of the humanities faculties of six universities
endorsed a document, entitled ‘Humanities Covenant 2000+’, which describes how a
well-balanced range of humanities courses can be maintained by increasing
cooperation and complementarity between the institutions. 189 This covenant was
followed more than two years later by a follow- up document considering, among
other things, the implications of the BA/MA struc ture for humanities courses. 190 In
this document, the heads of the humanities faculties agreed to withdraw the
University of Amsterdam’s course in Frisian language and literature, recommending
that the study of Frisian language and literature should be concentrated at the
University of Groningen. 191
6.121 The agreement between the heads of the humanities faculties to transfer the
University of Amsterdam’s course in Frisian language and literature to the University
of Groningen encountered a significant amount of resistance from the Fryske
Akademy and the provincial authority of Fryslân and led to protests from many
individuals and institutions in the Netherlands and abroad. The Fryske Akademy and
the provincial authority of Fryslân instituted interim injunction proceedings against
the University of Amsterdam to prevent it from removing the course in Frisian
language and literature from the Central Register of Higher Education Study
Programmes before the end of the applicable statutory periods. The proceedings were
won by the University of Amsterdam. The impending withdrawal of the course in

This Humanities Covenant was endorsed by the heads of the humanities faculties of the University of
Amsterdam, the University of Groningen, the University of Leiden, the University of Nijmegen, the University of
Utrecht and the Free University of Amsterdam. The heads of the humanities faculties of the Erasmus University,
Rotterdam, the University of Tilburg, the Open University and the University of Maastricht also gave their assent
to the covenant.

In his answer to questions submitted by Van der Hoek, Hoekema, Atsma and Rijpstra (MPs) on 28 December
2000, the Minister of Education, Culture and Science indicated that he did not regard the possibility of merging
the Amsterdam and Groningen facilities for the study of Frisian language and literature as inconsis tent with the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (1993) or the European Charter. The Minister did not foresee an
active role for himself in this regard, in view of the rule concerning the self-management of the institutions, but
he undertook to ensure that due care is exercised during the implementation of the procedure. See Appendix to
Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 2000-2001, no. 664, pp. 1373-1374.

Frisian language and literature was eventually averted when the central works council
and the central students’ council refused to accept the University of Amsterdam’s
decisio n. 192
6.122 In an advisory report, entitled ‘Vensters op de wereld’, the Committee on the
Humanities of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences notes that there
are ample reasons to concentrate the study of Frisian language and literature at the
University of Groningen. In view of the status of Frisian as the second official state
language, however, the Committee argues in favour of maintaining a minor facility at
the University of Amsterdam. 193
6.123 During the 1999-2000 academic year, a total number of 68 students were enrolled in
the course in Frisian language and literature at the University of Groningen. Six
students took the course as their main subject and 62 took it as their subsidiary
subject. During the 2000-2001 academic year, the corresponding figures were 60, 7
and 53, respectively. During the 1999-2000 academic year, no students took the
‘doctoraal’ examinations in Frisian. During the 2000-2001 academic year, two
students took the examinations. 194
6.124 On the initiative of the province of Fryslân, the special chair in Frisian language and
literature, which is funded by the province, was transferred to the ‘doctoraal’ course
in Frisian language and literature at the University of Amsterdam at the beginning of
the 1994-1995 academic year. Since then, the university has taught Frisian language
and literature as a main subject. The province of Fryslân funds the above- mentioned
chair through the Fryske Akademy. The chair is part of the ‘doctoraal’ course in
Frisian language and literature, which receives financial and staff support from both
the University of Amsterdam and the Fryske Akademy.
6.125 During the 1999-2000 academic year, a total number of 31 students were enrolled in
the course in Frisian language and literature at the University of Amsterdam. One
student took the course as a main subject. The majority of students were mature
students who sat in on the course and did not on the whole take the interim
examinations. Eight students did take the interim examinations. During the 2000-2001
academic year, a total of 55 students were enrolled in the course. Two students took
the course as a main subject. Once again, the majority of students were mature
students. Twenty-seven students took the interim examinations. 195
6.126 The University of Leiden and the Fryske Akademy maintain a special chair in Frisian
language and literature at the University of Leiden. Students can only study Frisian
language and literature as a subsidiary subject at the university. Since January 2002,
moreover, teaching is no longer provided by researchers associated with the Fryske
Akademy. During the 1999-2000 academic year, a total number of fourteen students

and occasional students attended the lectures on Frisian language and literature
(twelve of them à la carte) 196 . No students took the interim examinations. During the
2000-2001 academic year, thirteen students and occasional students attended the
lectures (eight of whom à la carte). Three students took an interim examination testing
their command of the Frisian language. 197
6.127 Finally, it is worth noting that Dutch is the statutorily prescribed language of
instruction in higher education. The law mentions a number of exceptions, such as the
teaching of other languages (cf. section 7.2 of the Higher Education and Research
Act). Institutions of higher education are required to adopt a linguistic code of
conduct that stipulates all the exceptions to the above- mentioned statutory rule, for
example, with regard to the use of Frisian or English (see section 7.2 (c) of the Higher
Education and Research Act).
6.128 All the colleges of higher professional education in the province of Fryslân have
adopted their own linguistic codes of conduct, as described in the preceding
paragraph. The linguistic code of conduct of the CHN came into force on 1 September
2000. The linguistic code of conduct of the NHL of April 1997, which entered into
force in September 1997, also still applies. The Van Hall Institute, finally, has
extended its linguistic code of conduct for 1995-2000 by another five years, and the
latter therefore applies until 2005. Generally speaking, Frisian is used only as one of
the languages of instruction in primary teacher training courses. Staff members and
students are allowed to use Frisian in individual contacts, provided this does not
hinder cooperation. Students may also submit their reports and essays in Frisian. At
the universities, Frisian is used as the language of instruction in the courses in Frisian
language and literature.
6.129 At the colleges of higher professional education in the province of Fryslân, Frisian is
only taught as part of the training courses for primary and secondary school teachers,
in accordance with the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under Article
8(1)(h) of the European Charter regarding the initial and in-service training of
teachers. In order to maintain the teaching of Frisian in their teacher training courses,
the CHN and the NHL both receive an annual grant of €34,033. The Dutch
government is of the opinion that this grant is sufficient to maintain an acceptable
facility for the teaching of Frisian. In addition, the province of Fryslân’s ‘Plan fan
oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ also devotes attention to teacher training for Frisian
teachers (see sections 6.157 to 6.183).
6.130 In the opinion of the Dutch government, Article 8(1)(e)(ii) of the European Charter
does not suggest that Frisian must be taught in higher professional education courses
other than teacher training courses. If they so desire, however, the colleges of higher
professional education in the province of Fryslân are free to include Frisian as a
compulsory or optional subject in all or some of their courses. If necessary, they can
use the specific-purpose grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science to
the province of Fryslân for this type of Frisian language education, but only if an

Studying à la carte means that anyone can attend lectures as an occasional student, regardless of age or prior
qualifications, but without being entitled to take interim examinations.

63

agreement has been concluded to this effect in the framework of the ‘Plan fan oanpak
Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ (see sections 6.20 and 6.21).
In the opinion of the Dutch government, Article 8(1)(e)(ii) of the European Charter
suggests that central government should undertake to maintain a basic facility for the
study of Frisian language and literature at university level and the teaching of Frisian
in higher professional education courses for primary and secondary school teachers.
This undertaking is being fulfilled by the Netherlands.
6.131 In summary, it is clear that the Netherlands has thus fulfilled the undertaking it
entered into under the European Charter to provide facilities for the study of the Frisian
language as a subject in university and other higher education.
Article 8(1)(f)(i): adult and continuing education

6.132 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to arrange for the
provision of adult and continuing education courses which are taught mainly or
wholly in [the Frisian language]’.
6.133 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that although there is a statutory basis for
the provision of adult and continuing education that is taught mainly or wholly in
Frisian, there is no evidence that such teaching exists in practice, apart from private
initiatives like those of the AFUK. According to government sources, adult and
continuing education lies within the responsibility of the local authorities. The
Committee considers that the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands is not being
fulfilled. 198 It therefore encourages the government to arrange for the provision of
adult and continuing education courses in Frisian.
6.134 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no specific
agreements on adult and continuing education, but does include various sections
concerning the province of Fryslân’s two regional training centres. As previously
noted (see sections 6.12 and 6.13), adult education, like secondary vocational
education, has been transferred to the regional training centres, which fall under the
new Adult and Vocational Education Act as of 1996. Any provisions appearing in the
Covenant concerning the regional training centres therefore apply equally to
secondary vocational education.
6.135 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will jointly strive, by means of consultation
with institutions and municipalities, to ensure that oral skills in the Frisian language
are included as a compulsory part of the examination syllabus of the relevant regional
training centres. For some specific occupational profiles, written skills in the Frisian
language will also be a compulsory part of the examination (Covenant 2.7.1).
6.136 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will jointly strive, by means of
consultation with institutions, to ensure that the regional training centres follow the
example of the colleges of higher professional education and draw up linguistic codes

of conduct specifying the status and use of the Frisian language (Covenant 2.7.2). The
parties agreed that this objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.137 In accordance with the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân will jointly strive to improve the status of
Frisian in the regional training centres. Use will be made of historical survey data and
central government and the province will collect further data, if necessary in
collaboration with the Inspectorate and research institutions, in order to identify trends
in quality and the effect of incentive schemes on the quality and status of Frisian in all
sectors of education. The aim will be to clarify at any rate matters such as the place of
Frisian in the quality assurance policies of schools, Frisian language skills among
teaching staff, the amount of time devoted to Frisian language as a subject, the extent
to which Frisian is chosen as an examination subject, the use of Frisian as the
language of instruction in other subject areas, and the teaching materials developed
and used for the teaching of Frisian (Covenant 2.7.3). The parties agreed that this
objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.138 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will jointly encourage the regional
training centres to include in-service training activities for their teaching staff in their
quality assurance plans, including training to improve their knowledge of Frisian
(Covenant 2.7.4). The parties agreed that this objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.139 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the province will pay attention to Frisian
language and culture when developing projects in the field of cultural education
(Covenant 2.7.5). The parties agreed that this objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.140 This section of the report, which deals with the current status of Frisian in regional
training centres, focuses mainly on adult education courses within the meaning of the
Adult and Vocational Education Act and Frisian- language courses for adults falling
within the scope of adult and continuing education within the meaning of the
European Charter. This section devotes only a limited amount of attention to the
status of Frisian in technical and vocational education, as the Netherlands did not
endorse the provisions concerning these forms of education. In support of its decision,
the Dutch government stated that there is no statutory requirement to teach Frisian as
an integral part of the curriculum in secondary vocational education, as provided for
in Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of the European Charter. There are no statutorily prescribed
subjects or examination subjects in vocational education, and institutions for
vocational education can therefore not be placed under any obligations in this area. 199
If they desire, regional training centres may, in consultation with municipalities and
the private sector, incorporate requirements concerning Frisian into the curriculum.
Future reports will examine how more attention can be devoted to the status of Frisian
in secondary vocational education, in view of the agreements concluded in the
framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) with regard
to the regional training centres.

6.141 Section 7.3.1 of the Adult and Vocational Education Act distinguishes between the
following forms of adult education:
•
adult general secondary education
•
courses providing a broad basic education
•
Dutch as a second language I and II
•
other courses aimed at fostering self-reliance.
Adult general secondary education focuses on the attainment, in full or in part, of a
VWO, HAVO or MAVO diploma (see section 7.3.4, subsection 1 of the Adult and
Vocational Ed ucation Act). The establishment of attainment targets for the other
forms of adult education is regulated as follows (see section 7.3.3, subsections 1 to 3
of the Adult and Vocational Education Act):
•
attainment targets for Dutch as a second language I and II are established by
ministerial order;
•
attainment targets for courses providing a broad basic education and other
courses aimed at fostering self-reliance may be established by ministerial
order.
The competent authority of each regional training centre may independently establish
attainment targets for other adult education courses.
6.142 The above- mentioned courses in Dutch as a second language, which are also
mentioned in the Adult and Vocational Education Act, are intended primarily for
members of ethnic groups that have settled in the Netherlands (see section 6,
subsection 1 (a) (1) of the Newcomers Integration Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees
1998, 261)). The content and level of the courses in Dutch as a second language are
established by ministerial order. 200 These various provisions do not take account of
the bilingual character of the province of Fryslân (see section 3.3.5 of this report).
6.143 In the framework of adult general secondary education, students in the province of
Fryslân can take courses at MAVO, HAVO or VWO level. The Friese Poort regional
training centre only offers courses at MAVO level (most recently during the 20012002 academic year) at its Emmeloord (Flevo-Poort) branch, that is to say, outside the
province of Fryslân. The Emmeloord branch does not teach Frisian as a subject. The
Friesland College regional training centre teaches subjects at MAVO, HAVO and
VWO level and offers Frisian as an optional subject. The teaching of Frisian is
contracted out to AFUK (see also section 6.147). Students take the final examinations
at the Friesland College. During the 2000-2001 academic year, a total of six students
took the AFUK course: two MAVO students, three HAVO students and one VWO
student. 201 During the 2001-2002 academic year, one MAVO student, one HAVO
student and three VWO students took Frisian. 202
6.144 Section 7.1.1 of the Adult and Vocational Education Act stipulates that teaching and
examinations should be conducted in Dutch. The Act mentions a number of
exceptions, such as the teaching of other languages. Institutions falling within the
scope of the Adult and Vocational Education Act are required to adopt a linguistic

rule, for example, with regard to the use of Frisian or English (see section 7.1.1 (b) of
the Adult and Vocational Education Act). The Adult and Vocational Education Act
thus provides a statutory basis for individual regional training centres to teach courses
mainly or wholly in Frisian.
6.145 In contrast to the colleges of higher professional education in Fryslân (see section
6.128), the regional training centres in Fryslân have not yet adopted a linguistic code
of conduct regarding the use of Frisian in adult and vocational education. In the ‘Plan
fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, the provincial authority of Fryslân recommends
that the regional training centres formulate language policies regulating the use of
Frisian within the next two years (see also section 6.136). The two Frisian regional
training centres, the Friese Poort and the Friesland College, do not oppose this
recommendation. With regard to the inclusion of Frisian among the subject modules
of certain vocational courses, however, both centres stipulate that there should first be
demand for Frisian-speakers in the marketplace. 203
6.146 The Adult and Vocational Education Act contains no references to the Frisian
language and its integration into adult education, nor does it contain specific
provisions with regard to Frisian courses in adult education in Fryslân. However, the
Act does leave room for the regional training centres and the local authorities to give
priority to Frisian in the range of courses offered. The Act therefore ensures that the
range of courses offered is the result of a contractual relationship between the regional
training centre and the municipality. The municipalities receive a government grant
for adult education for this purpose (section 2.3.1, subsection 1 and section 2.3.4,
subsection 1 of the Adult and Vocational Education Act). When using this grant, the
municipalities are free to set their own priorities with regard to the range of courses
offered and to conclude agreements with the regional training centres in this regard.
The Adult and Vocationa l Education Act also leaves the regional training centres free
to establish their own attainment targets for a range of courses that dovetail
specifically with regional or local needs (section 7.3.3, subsection 3 of the Adult and
Vocational Education Act). The policy freedom of the municipalities to set their own
priorities and of the regional training centres to establish their own attainment targets
therefore also applies to Frisian.
6.147 Special mention should be made of the activities of AFUK in the field of adult and
continuing education. This organisation, which is not part of a regional training
centre, organises Frisian courses for Frisian-speaking and non-Frisian-speaking adults
and develops teaching and course materials. Some of the courses offered by AFUK
are aimed at specific occupational groups, including employees of the courts in
Fryslân and provincial civil servants (see also sections 7.18 and 8.73). Every year,
approximately 1,000 students take AFUK’s language courses.
6.148 Central government provides the province of Fryslân with an annual grant to support
AFUK’s Frisian language courses. In 2001, the total value of the grant was NLG
1,116,148 (€506,480). Part of this amount is earmarked for the F-side in the
Leeuwarder Courant and Friesch Dagblad newspapers. 204 AFUK also receives general

total value of the municipal grants was NLG 47,025 (€21,340). 205
6.149 In summary, it is clear that the Netherlands has made a number of provisions to
facilitate the teaching of Frisian in the framework of adult and continuing education in
the province of Fryslân (see in particular section 6.148). The Adult and Vocational
Education Act, which regulates education in regional training centres, contains no
specific provisions on Frisian in adult education, but leaves the two regional training
centres in Fryslân and the local authorities free to include Frisian in the range of
courses offered. The competent authorities of the regional training centres concerned
are also free to establish attainment targets, pursuant to section 7.3.3, subsection 3 of
the Adult and Vocational Education Act (see section 6.146). Until now, the regional
training centres have not made use of the statutory possibility of drawing up a
linguistic code of conduct, as provided in section 7.1.1 of the Adult and Vocational
Education Act. In the framework of the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’, the
province of Fryslân will strive to ensure that the regional training centres draw up
such codes within the next two years (see section 6.136). In the absence of such
linguistic codes of conduct, the regional training centres cannot offer courses that are
taught mainly or wholly in Frisian in the various adult education programmes, except
where the teaching of Frisian is concerned. The proposed linguistic code of conduct
for the regional training centres is also meant to facilitate the use of Frisian in
secondary vocational education at the two regional training centres in Fryslân.
Article 8(1)(g): teaching of Frisian history and culture

6.150 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to make arrangements
to ensure the teaching of the history and the culture which is reflected by [the Frisian
language]’. The drafters of the European Charter were almost certainly referring to
statutory regulations in their reference to arrangements that offer guarantees in this
regard.
6.151 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that no statutory measures have been
taken to guarantee this undertaking. According to the information received by the
Committee, very little has been done in this field, with the exception of primary
education. In secondary education, in particular, virtually no attention is devoted to
Frisian history and culture, owing mainly to the lack of teaching material and
adequate funding. The Committee therefore considers that this undertaking is not
being fulfilled by the Netherlands. 206
6.152 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements
regarding regulations aimed at implementing this undertaking. Nevertheless, central
government and the province of Fryslân did agree to jointly encourage the provision
of classroom materials in the Frisian language by 2004, in order to support its use as
the language of instruction for subjects like environmental studies, biology, history,

205

206

Fryslân has supported the F-side financially since 1994 and has earmarked €102,100 for this purpose in 2002.
Editorial responsibility for the F-side belongs to the Stipepunt Frysk (i.e. the Frisian Language Support Centre),
which is part of AFUK.
AFUK’s commercial activities provide 60 per cent of the organisation’s income (publishing and book sales),
while the remaining 40 per cent comes from grants. In 2001, AFUK’s income stood at NLG 1,674,559.

life skills and cultural education (Covenant 2.9.3). In this context, central government
and the province will also encourage the development of applications in the field of
information and communications technology, such as Frisian- language multimedia
materials (Covenant 2.9.4).
6.153 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the province of Fryslân will devote
attention to Frisian language and culture when developing projects in the field of
cultural education (Covenant 2.4.4, 2.5.9 and 2.7.5).
6.154 The Netherlands has not adopted any statutory regulations to ensure that the Frisian
language is reflected in the teaching of history and culture in schools in the province of
Fryslân, in accordance with the European Charter. Furthermore, the 1996 cultural
education policy document Cultuur en School of the Ministry of Education, Culture and
Science did not explicitly address the special cultural situation in the province of
Fryslân, nor did the subsequent education memorandum of 1999.207 The policy
document on the basic principles of cultural policy for the 2001-2004 period, entitled
Cultuur als confrontatie, also fails to address Frisian language and culture explicitly
(see also sections 3.7.10 and 10.6).
6.155 The provincial authority of Fryslân devotes attention to cultural education in section
2.13 of its policy document on culture in Fryslân for the 2000-2004 period (see also
section 10.9). It emphasises the encouragement of amateur and professional theatre and
museum attendance, as a way of drawing pupils’ attention to local cultural expressions
in their immediate surroundings. As a result of the aforementioned education policy
document, the province of Fryslân has access to funding in excess of €145,000 for this
purpose, although the teaching of Frisian history and culture is not mentioned explicitly.
Nor is it mentioned in the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’.
6.156 In summary, although it appears that the teaching of Frisian history and culture does
not receive explicit attention in Dutch legislation, an effort is being made to develop
Frisian-language classroom materials for subjects like environmental studies, history
and cultural education. In the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001), the province of Fryslân will also devote attention to the interaction
between cultural education and Frisian in primary and secondary education and in
adult and vocational education. At the time of the reference date of this report (see
section 2.17), the implementation of the agreements concerning the position of Frisian
in cultural education and the teaching of Frisian history and culture, as concluded in
the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), still
required further elaboration.
Article 8(1)(h): basic and further training of teachers

6.157 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to provide the basic
and further training of the teachers required to implement those of subparagraphs a to g
accepted by [the Dutch government]’. This applies to the following forms of education:
•

207

pre-school education (subparagraph a)

•
•

primary education (subparagraph b)
secondary education (subparagraph c)
university and other higher education (subparagraph e)
adult and continuing education (subparagraph f)
teaching of Frisian history and culture (subparagraph g).

6.158 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that no statutory measures have so far
been taken for the provision of Frisian in the initial and in-service training of teachers
in pre-school and adult education. Furthermore, from the information the Committee
has received, it appears that in practice the implementation of this provision at other
levels is not satisfactory either, owing mainly to the lack of adequate funding. Central
government representatives have informed the Committee that a special advisory
body has looked into the matter. The Committee considers that the undertaking is not
being fulfilled by the Netherlands. 208 It therefore encourages the Dutch government to
develop a more active policy in this field to promote the implementation of this
provision. The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) seeks to
implement this recommendation (see sections 6.159 to 6.163).
6.159 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed with regard to the initial training of playgroup and
childcare workers in Fryslân that central government will consult with the social
partners on whether it is practicable for the initial training of these workers to include
active and passive Frisian language skills and the specific skills needed to teach
bilingual and multilingual children at pre-school level (Covenant 2.1.2). The parties
agreed that this objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.160 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed with regard to the initial training of teaching
assistants in primary education that they will conduct consultations with the regional
training centres in Fryslân in order to encourage them to integrate active Frisianlanguage skills and the educational skills required to teach bilingual and multilingual
children into their initial training courses for teaching assistants, or to make them a
compulsory part of the examination syllabus (Covenant 2.4.2). The parties agreed that
this objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.161 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed with regard to the training of primary and
secondary school teachers that central government will ensure that initial and inservice training is available for teachers involved in encouraging interest in Frisian in
primary and secondary education (Covenant 2.8.8). In addition, both parties will
jointly strive to encourage interest in the initial and in-service training of Frisian
teachers in Fryslân (Covenant 2.8.7). The parties agreed that both objectives will be
addressed by 2004.
6.162 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that central government will ensure that initial
training courses for primary school teachers provide students with the agreed basic
skills they need to start their careers, including the skills required for teaching Frisian.
208

In addition, central government will strive to ensure that the agreed basic skills for
secondary teacher training courses (including the course for teachers of Frisian)
include targets for classroom and educational skills relating to the teaching of
bilingual and multilingual children (Covenant 2.8.1). The parties agreed that this
objective will be addressed by 2004.
6.163 Finally, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains many
provisions regarding the importance of the fact that schools include training in
classroom and educational skills relating to the Frisian language and culture in their
in-service training or quality assurance plans. In this regard, central government and
the province of Fryslân have agreed that they will jointly act to encourage such
measures by the following educational institutions in Fryslân:
•
primary schools (Covenant 2.4.3)
•
secondary schools (Covenant 2.5.7)
•
schools falling under the Expertise Centres Act (Covenant 2.6.3)
•
regional training centres (Covenant 2.7.4)
•
institutions of higher education, both within and outside the province of
Fryslân (Covenant 2.8.6).
The parties agreed that these objectives will be addressed by 2004, with the exception
of the in-service training of primary school teachers, which will be addressed during
the 2004-2010 period.
6.164 Part of the funding for the Frisian- language facilities in the various initial teacher
training courses comes from central government, in the framework of the specificpurpose grant for Frisian-language education mentioned in the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (Covenant 2.3.1). Information concerning the
value of the grant can be found in section 6.55 of this report. In addition to the
government’s grant, the province of Fryslân also provides funding to the abovementioned Frisian- language facilities from its own resources. Finally, the schools
concerned also operate their own in-service training budgets, which can be used for
training teachers in Frisian and in the educational skills required for teaching bilingual
children.
6.165 In order to paint a clear picture of the current status of Frisian in the training of
teachers in the various education sectors, including childcare and playgroups, this
report now focuses on the various initial and – where applicable – in-service training
courses:
•
initial training of playgroup and childcare workers (see sections 6.166 to
6.167)
•
initial training of teaching assistants in primary education (see section 6.168)
•
the initial and in-service training of primary school teachers (see sections
6.169 to 6.172)
•
initial and in-service training and retraining of secondary school teachers (see
sections 6.173 to 6.176)
•
initial training of Frisian teachers working in other forms of education (see
sections 6.177 to 6.180)
•
attention devoted to Frisian language and culture in the above- mentioned
training courses (see section 6.181)
•
funding of the above- mentioned training courses (see section 6.182).

71

6.166 The training of playgroup and childcare workers falls within the scope of secondary
vocational education and therefore takes place at regional training centres, which fall
under the Adult and Vocational Education Act. Within these regional training centres,
this type of training falls within the scope of social and community work education.
The government has so far not adopted any statutory regulations regarding the
position of Frisian within this training course. Furthermore, at the time of the
reference date of this report (March 2002), the consultations with the social partners,
as described in section 2.1.2 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001), had not yet commenced (see section 6.159).
6.167 The two regional training centres in Fryslân, the Friesland College and the Friese
Poort, both offer social and community work training courses. At the beginning of the
2001-2002 academic year, the Friesland College regional training centre introduced a
module on bilingual education that devotes attention to Frisian, in addition to Turkish
and Moroccan. The purpose of the module is to prepare playgroup and childcare
workers for the potential home languages of children in childcare centres and
playgroups. It also seeks to help the students gain insight into language development
in children. In addition, the Friese Poort regional training centre wishes to introduce a
Frisian module into its social and community work training course, in the form of two
weekly teaching periods for a period of twenty weeks, from the beginning of the
2002-2003 academic year. 209 The Friese Poort and Friesland College regional training
centres are cooperating with AFUK and GCO Fryslân to establish the respective
modules. 210
6.168 The initial training of teaching assistants in primary education also takes place at the
regional training centres. As yet, this training course does not devote attention to
active Frisian-language skills and the classroom and educational skills required to
teach bilingual and multilingual children. Moreover, at the time of the reference date
of this report, central government and the province of Fryslân had not yet
implemented section 2.4.2 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001) (see section 6.160).
6.169 In the Netherlands, the initial training of primary school teachers takes place at
colleges of higher professional education. The Christian College of Higher
Professional Education of the Northern Netherlands (CHN) and the Northern College
of Higher Professional Education in Leeuwarden (NHL) both offer teacher training
courses. As Frisian is a compulsory subject in primary schools in the province of
Fryslân, it is also a compulsory module in the initial training courses offered to
primary school teachers at the two Frisian colleges. At the NHL, students are obliged
to study Frisian during the first two years of their four-year study programme, after
which it becomes an optional subject. 211 At the CHN, Frisian is an optional subject
throughout the teacher training course. Both colleges give students an endorsement
for Frisian on their diplomas when they have successfully completed their
examinations, including the Frisian examination. In accordance with section 186,
subsection 5 of the 1998 Primary Education Act, this endorsement authorises teachers
to teach Frisian in primary schools.

6.170 Recent figures published in the ‘Plan fan oanpak Frysk yn it ûnderwiis’ indicate that
the percentage of students obtaining the endorsement for Frisian is significantly
higher at the CHN than at the NHL. 212 This is explained by the fact that students at the
CHN can obtain the endorsement by including Frisian as an optional subject in their
examination packages. In this context, the CHN does not distinguish between Frisianspeaking and non-Frisian-speaking students. At the NHL, however, students wishing
to obtain the endorsement for Frisian must take an extra Frisian course on top of their
regular study programme (in practice, this entails additional teaching practice, classes
and assignments, such as presentations and reports). Furthermore, the NHL
differentiates between Frisian-speaking and non-Frisian-speaking students: the latter
are obliged to take an extra module in order to reach the same level as the Frisianspeaking students by the end of their third year of studies. In summary, it is clear that
the requirements set by the NHL for obtaining the endorsement for Frisian are higher
than those of the CHN.
6.171 The preceding paragraph indicates that certain trainee primary school teachers choose
not to obtain an endorsement for Frisian. It appears that this choice also has
implications for the command of Frisia n among primary school teachers in Fryslân.
Thus, according to the Education Inspectorate’s report on Frisian in primary
education, over a third of teachers are not qualified to teach Frisian. The report also
indicates that 44 per cent of teachers cannot write Frisian and 17 per cent cannot read
it. Furthermore, 96 per cent and 84 per cent of teachers, respectively, are capable of
understanding and speaking Frisian. 213
6.172 Primary school teachers are able to take an in-service training course in Frisian. In the
case of the NHL, this course is provided by the Educatief Centrum Noord en Oost.
GCO Fryslân also organises courses for primary school teachers who wish to expand
or refresh their knowledge of Frisian. The Taalsintrum Frysk language centre, which
is part of GCO Fryslân, organises Frisian courses in cooperation with AFUK. Primary
schools have their own in-service training budgets, which can be used for training in
Frisian. It is not known how many primary school teachers make use of this
opportunity.
6.173 In the Netherlands, a distinction is made between grade one and grade two teachers.
Grade one teachers are qualified to teach in all the years of secondary school, while
grade two teachers are only qualified to teach in the first three years of senior general
secondary education (HAVO) and pre-university education (VWO) and in all the
years of pre-vocational secondary education (VMBO) and secondary vocational
education (MBO). The initial training of grade two secondary school teachers takes
place at colleges of higher professional education. The initial training of grade one
secondary school teachers takes place at colleges of higher professional education and
universities.

6.174 Of the two colleges of higher professional education in the province of Fryslân, only
the NHL offers an initial training course for a grade one or grade two certificate of
competence in Frisian in secondary education. During the 1999-2000 academic year,
four students (including one who started at the beginning of the second term) were
enrolled in the grade two teacher training course at the NHL. During the 2000-2001
academic year, there were seven students (including three who started at the
beginning of the second term), and fifteen students (including five who will start at
the beginning of the second term) have so far registered for 2002-2003. During the
1999-2000 and 2000-2001 academic years, one student was enrolled in the grade one
teacher training course. 214 There were no grade one students during 2001-2002. 215
6.175 The University of Groningen offers a grade one teacher training course for Frisian
teachers. One student graduated from the course at the end of the 1999-2000 academic
year. During the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 academic years, one student was enrolled
on the course. No students graduated during this time. 216
6.176 Between 1995 and 1997, the NHL organised a one-off two-year Frisian retraining
course for secondary school teachers, in response to the increase in demand for
qualified Frisian teachers that resulted from the inclusion of Frisian as a compulsory
subject in basic secondary education. In 1995, the Ministry of Education, Culture and
Science provided places for twenty teachers on a Frisian retraining course (see also
section 6.89). The participating schools agreed in writing to use the retrained teachers
to teach Frisian. The retraining course was intended primarily for teachers that would
have otherwise faced redundancy due to declining student numbers. According to the
Education Inspectorate’s report on Frisian in basic secondary education, however, it
was difficult to find even ten teachers that were willing to take the course. 217 For the
sake of completeness, it is worth noting that secondary schools have their own inservice training budgets, which can be used for training in Frisian. It is not known
how many secondary school teachers make use of this opportunity.
6.177 The initial training of Frisian teachers who work in universities and other institutions
of higher education takes place at universities where Frisian can be studied as a main
subject, that is to say, the University of Groningen and the University of Amsterdam.
6.178 With regard to the training of Frisian teachers in adult general secondary education,
the reader is referred to the paragraphs concerning the training of grade one and grade
two secondary school teachers (see sections 6.173 to 6.175). As previously noted, the

In response to reports in the Frisian press concerning the reported closure of the NHL’s training course for Frisian
teachers because of a financial shortfall, Atsma and Eurlings (MPs) submitted questions to the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science and the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations on 13 September
2000. Supported by the State Secretary, the Minister responded that any decision to shut down the programme
would constitute a reason for him, in the light of his responsibility under the European Charter to provide for the
training of Frisian teachers in secondary schools, to conduct further consultations with the college and the
province of Fryslân concerning the possibility of maintaining the training facility. Above all, however, the
Minister considered it important to increase public support for the Frisian language. Both aspects of the
Minister’s response were incorporated in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see section
6.161).

regional training centre concerned uses Frisian teachers provided by AFUK, instead
of its own staff, for its teacher training courses for adult general secondary education
(see section 6.143). It has thereby opted for a solution that is both practical and
effective.
6.179 There are currently no facilities reflecting the bilingual nature of the province of
Fryslân as far as the training of teachers working in the other forms of education listed
in the Adult and Vocational Education Act (see section 6.12) is concerned.
6.180 AFUK independently establishes the course requirements for the initial training of the
teachers of its own Frisian language courses. With regard to in-service training,
AFUK organises biannual meetings, the so-called lesjouwersgearkomsten, and special
in-service training courses for the teachers of its courses, the latter since 1995. 218
6.181 The teaching of Frisian history and culture (subparagraph g) is included in all the
aforementioned teacher training courses.
6.182 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that the position of Frisian in teacher
training courses is not satisfactory, mainly owing to the lack of adequate funding. In
the opinion of the Dutch government, this statement is incorrect, at least in relation to
the current state of affairs, especially with regard to the training of primary and
secondary school teachers. First of all, the province of Fryslân receives an annual
specific-purpose grant for Frisian in education from the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Science (see section 6.55). Second, the province of Fryslân provides a
total of €68,067 to the CHN and the NHL for maintaining and improving the quality
of the initial training of Frisian teachers in primary schools. Third, the provincial
authority of Fryslân provides a total of €90,756 for maintaining and improving the
quality of the initial training of Frisian teachers in secondary schools. Fourth, at the
time of the introduction of basic secondary education, central government provided a
special grant to help teachers obtain a grade two certificate of competence in Frisian.
Finally, in 2001, central government provided €165,630 for higher education. 219
6.183 In summary, it appears that the only formal lacuna with regard to knowledge of the
Frisian language is in the training of teachers working in the forms of adult education
mentioned in the Adult and Vocational Education Act (see section 6.141). Recently,
more attention has been devoted to the bilingual nature of the province of Fryslân in
the training of playgroup and childcare workers. In fact, in the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and the province of Fryslân
agreed to improve the position of Frisian in training courses for teachers in adult
education and playgroup and childcare workers. In the opinion of the Dutch
government, the financial resources provided by central government and the province
of Fryslân, together with the in-service training budgets of the individual schools, are
sufficient to allow attention to be devoted to Frisian in the initial and in-service
training of teachers and playgroup and childcare workers in accordance with the
relevant undertaking in the European Charter.

6.184 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to set up a supervisory
body or bodies responsible for monitoring the measures taken and progress achieved in
establishing or developing the teaching of [the Frisian language] and for drawing up
periodic reports of their findings, which will be made public’.
6.185 Section 88 of the Explanatory Report states: ‘[…] The characteristics of such a
supervisory institution are not specified in paragraph 1.i. It could accordingly be an
education authority body or an independent institution. This function could also be
conferred on the body provided for in Article 7, paragraph 4, of the charter. In any
case, the charter requires the findings of the monitoring to be made public.’
6.186 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that, in the Dutch context, the Education
Inspectorate acts as a supervisory body in education matters. The Committee was
informed by central government representatives that the Education Inspectorate and a
research institute carried out a survey evaluating the use of Frisian in primary
education in spring 2001. 220 The Committee therefore considers that this undertaking
is being fulfilled by the Netherlands. It looks forward to receiving the information
based on this survey and trusts that the Education Inspectorate will ensure the drawing
up of periodical reports at all levels of education. 221
6.187 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that, parallel to the periodical reports on the
implementation of the European Charter, the Education Inspectorate will issue threeyearly bulletins on bilingual and multilingual education in the province of Fryslân.
These bulletins will be integrated into the multi- year plans for large-scale evaluations
by the Education Inspectorate (Covenant 2.10.1). This agreement entails that the
Education Inspectorate will report on the position of Frisian in the various education
sectors every three years. The parties agreed that this objective will be addressed by
2004.
6.188 In addition, central government has decided to ask the Education Council, in its
capacity as the government’s advisory body on education matters, to devote attention
to the position of Frisian in education. This decision was developed further in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), in which central government
and the province of Fryslân agreed that, where appropriate, central government will
involve the Education Council in the development of policies on the Frisian language
and culture in education (Covenant 2.10.2). The parties agreed that this objective will
be addressed by 2004.
6.189 Prior to the conclusion of the new Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, the
Education Inspectorate already reported periodically on the position of Frisian in
education. This activity was in accordance with the above- mentioned role of the
Inspectorate as a supervisory body in the field of education in the Netherlands, which
includes teaching in and of Frisian. 222 In this context, the Inspectorate has published a
220

221
222

These reports on the position of Frisian in primary education have already been discussed in depth (see sections
6.62 to 6.66). For the sake of brevity, the reader is referred to them here. In 2001, the Education Inspectorate also
published a report on the position of Frisian in basic secondary education (see sections 6.90 to 6.92).
Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 72.
The task of the Education Inspectorate will be regulated by the new Education Inspection Act. According to the
bill presented to the House of Representatives on 5 June 2001, the Education Inspectorate will be responsible for

76

number of reports on its findings with regard to the position of Frisian in primary and
special education. 223 In addition, the Inspectorate has recently published reports on
primary education in Frisian in the province of Fryslân (2001) and on the position of
Frisian in basic secondary education (1999). These two reports indicate that the
position of Frisian in primary and secondary schools still falls short of the attainment
targets for Frisian and, thus, of the Netherlands’ undertaking under the Charter with
regard to these school types. In its reports, the Education Inspectorate does not
provide any insight into the manner in which the schools’ plans for in-service training
address these shortcomings. 224
6.190 In connection with recent policy developments concerning basic secondary education,
the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science asked the Education Council to devote
attention to the position of Frisian language and culture in education in its advisory
report, in accordance with the relevant agreement in the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture. The Education Council took this request into consideration in
its advisory report on the modification of basic secondary education. For the sake of
brevity, the reader is referred to sections 6.7 and 6.93 to 6.95 of this report, where the
advisory report of the Education Council is discussed.
6.191 In summary, it is clear that, by implementing the agreements concluded in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture concerning the Education Inspectorate
and the Education Council, the Netherlands is fulfilling its undertaking under the
Charter to draw up periodic reports on the position of Frisian in schools in the
province of Fryslân.
Article 8(2): educational arrangements outside the province of Fryslân

6.192 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘with regard to
education and in respect of territories other than those in which [the Frisian language] is
traditionally used, … if the number of users of [the Frisian language] justifies it, to
allow, encourage or provide teaching in or of [the Frisian language] at all the
appropriate stages of education’.
6.193 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that there is some teaching of Frisian
outside the province of Fryslân, at primary school level and in university and adult
education. The Committee therefore considers that this undertaking is being fulfilled
by the Netherlands. 225
6.194 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no provisions
concerning the teaching of Frisian outside the provinc e of Fryslân, in so far as this
does not concern university education.

periodically evaluating the quality of education in the Netherlands on the basis of a number of criteria that will be
indicated in the Act (Parliamentary Papers 27 783).

6.195 Outside the province of Fryslân, Frisian is traditionally spoken by part of the
population along the border of the provinces of Fryslân and Groningen in the area of
Opende, in the municipalities of Grootegast and Marum. 226 On the basis of section 9.8
of the Primary Education Act 1998, schools in this area are permitted to use Frisian as
one of their languages of instruction.
6.196 In territories outside the province of Fryslân where Frisian is not traditionally used, as
mentioned in the relevant provision of the European Charter, limited use is currently
being made of the opportunity to teach Frisian.
6.197 First, in this context, mention should be made of the Frisian courses at universities
outside the province of Fryslân. The reader is referred to the section of this report
concerning Article 8(1)(e) (see sections 6.110 to 6.126).
6.198 Second, mention should be made of the Groningen branch of the CHN’s training
course for primary school teachers, where Frisian is taught as an optional subject if
the number of students justifies it. This appears to be the case. During the 2001-2002
academic year, 22 students registered to study Frisian, that is to say, about a third of
the total number of students at the Groningen branch. During the 1999-2000 and
2000-2001 academic years, some fifteen students studied Frisian. The Groningen
branch differentiates between Frisian-speaking and non-Frisian-speaking students, but
does not offer a formal certificate of competence in Frisian, for which students must
follow the relevant part of the course at the main branch of the CHN in Leeuwarden.
It is not known how many students make use of this opportunity.
6.199 Finally, if there is sufficient interest, Frisian courses for adults are organised outside
the province of Fryslân under the supervision of AFUK. In 2001, AFUK organised six
such courses in four locations outside the province of Fryslân. 227 In addition, AFUK
offers a distance learning course in Frisian. Students receive course material at home
from which they can learn Frisian through independent study. If they desire, students
may request supervision. For example, they can send their completed language
exercises to AFUK and receive the corrected exercises in return.
6.200 In summary, it is clear that the Netherlands is fulfilling its undertaking with regard to
the teaching of Frisian outside the province of Fryslân. The relevant facilities can be
found primarily in university education, the initial primary teacher training and
continuing education.
6.201 Finally, it is clear that education is a complex and wide-ranging field in respect of
which the Netherlands has endorsed nine provisions from Article 8 of the European
Charter. As much as possible, this report aims to provide a short summary of Dutch
policy initiatives in relation to the various undertakings entered into by the
Netherlands under the European Charter. In view of the differentiated character of this
policy field, the reader is refe rred to the various summaries:
•
pre-school education (see section 6.39)
•
primary education (see section 6.70)

secondary education (see sections 6.98 and 6.109)
university or other higher education (see section 6.114)
adult and continuing education (see section 6.134)
teaching of Frisian history and culture (see section 6.145)
basic and further training of teachers (see section 6.166)
supervisory body (see section 6.173)
educational arrangements outside the province of Fryslân (see section 6.182)

In general, it is worth adding that central government focuses, in cooperation with the
provincial authority of Fryslân, on the establishment and implementation of statutory
measures and on the relevant preconditions, financial and otherwise. These matters
are part of the consultations taking place in the framework of the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001).
The above- mentioned consultations take account of the provisions of the Charter
endorsed by the Netherlands as well as the observations of the Committee of Experts
of the Council of Europe. In response to these observations, a few comments are in
order. Central government and the province of Fryslân recognise that in certain areas
(for example, primary and secondary education) the current situatio n in schools in the
province of Fryslân is not in accordance with the undertakings entered into by the
Netherlands. Similar shortcomings have been identified in pre-school education. In
the coming years, central government and the province of Fryslân will do what they
can to rectify the situation, obviously in consultation with the relevant actors, as
agreed in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001). Many of the
initiatives aimed at improving the position of Frisian in education, as included in the
Covenant, have already been described in the preceding paragraphs.
In some of the areas addressed by Article 8 of the Charter, for example, university and
other higher education, central government is of the opinion that a qualification of the
judgement of the Committee of Experts is in order, as the current situation in those
areas is already in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. This argument has
already been advanced elsewhere in this report. For the sake of completeness, the
reader is referred to it here.

Article 9: Judicial authorities

7.1

In response to the first periodical report on the European Charter, the Netherlands
adopted the Notaries Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1999, 190) and the Frisianlanguage Constitutions of Frisian Associations and Foundations Act (Bulletin of Acts
and Decrees 2001, 574). Since entering into force, the two Acts have expanded the
right to use the Frisian language in legal matters (see sections 7.41 to 7.44 and 7.49)
and contribute to the further implementation of the provision endorsed by the
Netherlands under Article 9(2) of the European Charter.

7.2

Prior to the entry into force of the above- mentioned acts, the amended Use of Frisian
(Legal Matters) Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1995, 440) entered into force on 1
January 1997. This Act contributes to the implementation of the provisions endorsed
by the Netherlands under Article 9(1) of the European Charter. It provides that any
party to, interested party or witness in a case coming befo re the courts in the province
of Fryslân may use the Frisian language. In addition, in any case pending before a

79

court in the province of Fryslân, documents in the action, with the exception of
notices of summons and charges in criminal cases, may be drafted in Frisian. The Act
also determines who may, on his or her own request, be sworn in as a translator for
the Frisian language by the courts and which provisions concerning sworn translators
are applicable. As it happens, the assistance of an interpreter was not required at any
hearings during the 1999-2001 reporting period. 228
7.3

The Committee of Experts considers that the text of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters)
Act is in accordance with the undertakings concerning the use of Frisian in legal
matters entered into by the Dutch government under the European Charter. 229 In this
sense, the Netherlands has fulfilled its undertakings, but the Committee considers that
there are still problems relating to implementation. The Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001) contains a number of agreements concerning
implementation (see sections 7.4 to 7.7). The Committee of Experts further notes that,
in connection with the use of Frisian in legal matters, there is a need for a legal
dictionary. 230 This need was met in 2000 with the appearance of a Dutch-Frisian legal
dictionary. 231

7.4

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that, in
accordance with articles 9(1)(b)(i) and 9(1)(c)(i) of the European Charter, courts
hearing civil or administrative cases may, at the request of one of the parties, permit
proceedings to take place in Frisian, providing that the other parties have no objection
and that there is still the option of using Dutch (Covenant 3.6). At present, the
Netherlands has not endorsed the relevant provisions in the European Charter.

7.5

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the Fryslân provincial executive further agreed that they will pursue a policy of public
education designed to ensure public knowledge and routine use of the options
available under the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act (Covenant 3.4). In his address
on the occasion of the launch of the above- mentioned Dutch-Frisian legal dictionary
on 11 December 2000 in Leeuwarden, the State Secretary for the Interior and
Kingdom Relations stated that, in consultation with the courts in the province of
Fryslân and the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom
Relations would create a register of the number and the types of cases (criminal, civil
or administrative) that are conducted in the Frisian language. 232

7.6

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), it was further agreed
that central government will strive to ensure that staff dealing directly with the public
at the courts in the province of Fryslân are offered training to improve their active or
passive knowledge of the Frisian language (Covenant 3.7). 233 Sections 7.18 and 7.19

Delivered by the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations on behalf of the Minister of Justice on
the occasion of the launch of the Dutch-Frisian legal dictionary on 11 December 2000 in Leeuwarden.
Instead of ‘courts in the province of Fryslân’, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) employs
the now outdated ‘district court, public prosecutor’s office and subdistrict courts in the province of Fryslân’. In a

80

of this report discuss the Frisian language courses offered in the framework of
employee training at the district court and the court of appeal in Leeuwarden.
7.7

Finally, in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), it was agreed
that central government will strive to ensure that an evaluation of the Use of Frisian
(Legal Matters) Act is conducted if problems arise in practice that necessitate it.
Measures resulting from any such evaluation will be implemented (Covenant 3.3).

Article 9(1)(a)(ii): criminal proceedings (oral use of Frisian)
Article 9(1)(a)(iii): criminal proceedings (written and oral evidence)

7.8

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to guarantee the
accused the right to use [the Frisian language]’ at hearings in criminal cases
conducted in the province of Fryslân. The statutory basis for this is sections 2 and 3 of
the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act: ‘In all cases in which a person present at a
court hearing held in the province of Fryslân speaks in his official capacity, is
required to undergo examination, or has the authority to speak, he shall be authorised
to use the Frisian language.’ In theory, translation costs are borne by the party
submitting the document that is to be translated, unless it is more logical to charge the
costs to the state, for example, if the judge cannot read Frisian.

7.9

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands also undertook ‘to provide that
requests and evidence, whether written or oral, shall not be considered inadmissible
solely because they are formulated in [the Frisian language]’ at a hearing in a criminal
case held in the province of Fryslân. The statutory basis for this is sections 2 and 3
(oral use of Frisian) and sectio n 7, subsection 1 of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters)
Act, which states: ‘In criminal, civil and administrative cases pending before a court
in the province of Fryslân, documents in the action, with the exception of notices of
summons and charges in criminal cases, may be written in Frisian.’ 234 Section 7,
subsection 2 of the Act states that, if desirable for an adequate assessment of the
document, the court may, on its own initiative or at the request of another party
involved in the case, require that a translation into Dutch be appended.

7.10

The Committee of Experts considers that the text of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters)
Act is in accordance with the undertakings entered into by the Dutch government
under the European Charter concerning the use of Frisian in criminal proceedings. In
this sense, the Netherlands has fulfilled its undertakings, although the Committee
considers that there are still problems relating to implementation. 235 In support of this
contention, the Committee advances three reasons, which are discussed below.

7.11

According to the Committee of Experts, the first reason why little use is made of the
right to speak Frisian during hearings – and thus including hearings in criminal cases

234

235

recent reorganisation of the courts, the subdistrict courts were merged with the district court. The current report
employs the new terminology.
An undertaking has now been given that, in the foreseeable future, every notice of summons in a criminal case
before Leeuwarden district court will bear the following text: ‘You have the right to speak Frisian during the
hearing’ (see also section 7.13).
Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 74 and 77.

81

– is mainly a lack of information. 236 The Committee therefore concludes that there is a
need to inform Frisian-speakers of their right to use Frisian in proceedings before the
courts in the province of Fryslân. 237
7.12

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) recognises the importance
of providing information. Article 3.4 of the Covenant contains an agreement to this
effect (see section 7.5).

7.13

In order to disseminate this information, a sign displaying the text ‘You have the right
to speak Frisian during the hearing’ in Dutch and Frisian was placed outside the
entrance to every courtroom in the province of Fryslân in November 2001. 238
Furthermore, the President of Leeuwarden district court has indicated that, in the
foreseeable future, every notice of summons in a criminal case will bear a similar
text. 239 Finally, there are plans to start collecting data concerning the number of
criminal cases that are conducted in Frisian in the near future (see section 7.5).

7.14

The website of Leeuwarden district court also provides information on the use and
history of Frisian in legal matters. 240 In this context, mention should also be made of
two publications produced for the general public by the Public Prosecution Service,
namely, a leaflet on the Public Prosecution Service, which appears in many other
languages besides Frisian, and a booklet of Frisian-Dutch legal terminology. 241

7.15

As the second reason why little use is made of the right to speak Frisian during
hearings, the Committee of Experts points to the lack of a dictionary specialising in
terms used within the judicial system. 242 As already mentioned, this specific problem
has now been resolved (cf. section 7.3). For this reason, among others, the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements concerning legal
terminolo gy in the Frisian language.

7.16

As the third reason, the Committee of Experts notes that, according to the information
it has received from government representatives, there is still a shortage of members
and employees of the judiciary who are sufficiently competent in Frisian to use it in
practice. 243

7.17

In article 3.7 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central
government and the province of Fryslân concluded an agreement concerning Frisian
language training for staff dealing directly with the public at Leeuwarden district
court (see section 7.6).

No figures are available concerning the number of criminal cases in which Frisian is used orally and/or in writing,
but it is clear that relatively little Frisian is spoken during proceedings before the judicial authorities in the
province of Fryslân.

7.18

According to the Ministry of Justice, almost all members of the judiciary working in
Fryslân have a reasonable to good understanding of Frisian, with the understandable
exception of recently appointed judges who are not native Frisian-speakers. In 1999,
twenty people working at the courts in the province of Fryslân registered for Frisian
language courses in reading and comprehension, speaking and writing, which were
provided at the cour thouse during work hours by AFUK. In 2000, the number of
registrations was too low for the courses to continue, but individual employees were
still able to take advantage of AFUK’s other courses at the courts’ expense. 244

7.19

The district court in the province of Fryslân has included a Frisian language course as
a set element in the recently created introductory programme for new employees. The
possibility of taking a Frisian language course was mentioned in an advertisement in
the Nederlands Juristenblad of December 2000 and the Advocatenblad of January
2001 inviting applications for the position of a judge at Leeuwarden district court. 245
The possibility of taking a Frisian language course has not yet been mentioned in the
other employment advertisements of Leeuwarden district court, in which vacancies
for staff dealing directly with the public at the court are announced (cf. section 7.6).

Article 9(1)(b)(iii): civil proceedings (use of Frisian in documents and evidence)

7.20

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to allow documents
and evidence to be produced in [the Frisian language], if necessary by the use of
interpreters and translations’, at hearings in civil cases conducted in the province of
Fryslân. The statutory basis for this is sections 7 and 7a of the Use of Frisian (Legal
Matters) Act.

7.21

The Committee of Experts considers that the text of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters)
Act is in accordance with the undertakings entered into by the Dutch government
under the European Charter concerning the use of Frisian in civil proceedings. 246 In
this sense, the Netherlands has fulfilled its undertakings, although the Committee
considers that this is not yet the case in practice, for the same reasons mentioned
above in relation to criminal cases (cf. sections 7.11 to 7.19).

7.22

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains a number of
agreements that seek to promote the implementation of the Use of Frisian (Legal
Matters) Act in the light of the undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under the
European Charter (Covenant 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7). The agreements also apply to civil
cases. For the content of these agreements, please see sections 7.5 to 7.7 of this report.

7.23

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) also contains a number of
agreements that focus specifically on civil proceedings. At the time of its ratification
of the European Charter, the Netherlands did not adopt Article 9(1)(b)(i) concerning
the conduct of civil proceedings in the Frisian language. However, in the framework
of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân did agree that central government will strive to ensure that, in
accordance with Article 9(1)(b)(i) of the European Charter, courts hearing civil cases

244

245
246

The information in sections 7.17 to 7.19 is of a general nature and therefore applies to all the members of the
judiciary in Fryslân, and not just to the members connected to the criminal division.
Letter dated 7 March 2002 from the district court of Leeuwarden to the Fryske Akademy.
Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 78.

83

may, at the request of one of the parties, permit proceedings to take place in Frisian,
providing that the other parties have no objection and that there is still the option of
using Dutch, as previously noted in section 7.4 (Covenant 3.6).
Central government has expressed an ambition to implement this agreement, which
also applies to administrative proceedings, by 2004 (cf. section 7.31). In view of this
commitment, the current periodical report on the imple mentation of the European
Charter is an appropriate forum to report on the measures taken by the Netherlands in
this regard.
7.24

At present, the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act already provides that a party, an
interested party, or a witness may speak Frisian during a hearing in a civil case, in
accordance with the provisions contained in sections 2 and 4 of the Act. Where
necessary, the court may rule that assistance shall be provided by an interpreter,
provided that this does not in its opinion unduly delay the proceedings.

7.25

It was agreed in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) that central
government will strive to ensure that arrangements are in place for the use of
interpreters and translations in civil proceedings. Where the court requires the use of
an interpreter or witness, these arrangements will be available free of charge
(Covenant 3.2). Central government has expressed an ambition to implement this
agreement, which also applies to administrative proceedings, by 2004 (cf. section
7.33).

7.26

In view of the special status of civil cases, the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act
stipulates explicitly that, in certain cases, the fee of the interpreter who provides his
services in a civil case and the costs of the translatio n of documents in civil actions
shall be paid by the state (sections 4a and 7a). These provisions seek to introduce the
possibility that the fee of an interpreter or translator will be paid by the state if their
services are required because the judge does not understand or read Frisian. The
above- mentioned provision in section 3.2 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language
and Culture (2001) expands on this idea. As it happens, the assistance of an interpreter
was not required at any hearings during the 1999-2001 reporting period. 247

7.27

No figures are available concerning the number of civil cases in which Frisian is used
orally and/or in writing, but it is clear that relatively little Frisian is spoken in
proceedings before the judicial authorities in the province of Fryslân. Exceptions to
this rule occur mainly in the field of civil law, including: examinations of minors in
family- law cases, examinations in guardianship cases, land consolidation proceedings,
especially complaints procedures before a delegated judge, tenancy proceedings,
examinations in the framework of compulsory admissions under the Psychiatric
Hospitals (Compulsory Admission) Act and examinations in cases regarding
receivership or administration. As previously noted, there are plans to start collecting
data concerning the number and types of cases, including civil cases, in which the
proceedings are conducted in Frisian and to provide more information concerning the
option of using Frisian in proceedings before the judicial authorities in the province of
Fryslân (cf. section 7.5). The inclusion of Frisian language courses in the range of

247

Letter dated 7 March 2002 from Leeuwarden district court to the Fryske Akademy.

84

courses offered to members of the judiciary is meant to promote the use of Frisian in
civil and other cases (cf. sections 7.6, 7.18 and 7.19).
Article 9(1)(c)(ii): administrative proceedings (oral use of Frisian)
Article 9(1)(c)(iii): administrative proceedings (use of Frisian in documents and evidence)

7.28

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook
c (ii) ‘to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court, that he or
she may use [the Frisian language] without thereby incurring additional expense,
and/or
c (iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in [the Frisian language], if
necessary by the use of interpreters and translations’
at hearings in administrative cases conducted in the province of Fryslân (Article
9(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) of the European Charter).

7.29

The Committee of Experts considers that the text of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters)
Act is in accordance with the undertakings entered into by the Dutch government
under the European Charter concerning the use of Frisian in administrative
proceedings. 248 In this sense, the Netherlands has fulfilled its undertakings, although
the Committee considers that this is not yet the case in practice, for the same reasons
mentioned above in relation to criminal cases (cf. sections 7.11 to 7.19).

7.30

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains a number of
agreements that seek to promote the implementation of the Use of Frisian (Legal
Matters) Act in the light of the undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under the
European Charter (Covenant 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7). The agreements also apply to
administrative cases. For the content of these agreements, please see sections 7.5 to
7.7 of this report.

7.31

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) also contains a number of
agreements that focus specifically on administrative proceedings. At the time of its
ratification of the European Charter, the Netherlands did not adopt Article 9(1)(c)(i)
concerning the conduct of administrative proceedings in the Frisian language.
However, in the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001), central government and the province of Fryslân agreed that central
government will strive to ensure that, in accordance with Article 9(1)(c)(i) of the
European Charter, courts trying administrative cases may, at the request of one of the
parties, permit proceedings to take place in Frisian, providing that the other parties
have no objection and that there is still the option of using Dutch, as previously noted
in section 7.4 (Covenant 3.6).
Central government has expressed an ambition to implement this agreement, which
also applies to civil proceedings, by 2004 (cf. section 7.23). In view of this
commitment, the current periodical report on the implementation of the European
Charter is an appropriate forum to report on the measures taken by the Netherlands in
this regard.

7.32

At present, the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act already provides that a party, an
interested party, or a witness may speak Frisian during a hearing in an administrative
case, in accordance with the provisions contained in sections 2 and 5 of the Act.
Where necessary, the court may rule that assistance shall be provided by an
interpreter, provided that this does not in its opinion unduly delay the proceedings.
Section 7 of the Act further provides that documents may be written in Frisian. In
such cases, a court may, on its own initiative or at the request of another party
involved in the case, require that a translation into Dutch of the documents concerned
be appended.

7.33

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), it was agreed that
central government will strive to ensure that arrangements are in place for the use of
interpreters and translations in administrative proceedings. Where the court requires
the use of an interpreter or witness, these arrangements will be available free of
charge (Covenant 3.2). Central government has expressed an ambition to implement
this agreement, which also applies to administrative proceedings, by 2004 (cf. section
7.25).

7.34

With regard to administrative cases, the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act stipulates
explicitly that, in certain cases, the fee of the interpreter who provides his services in
an administrative case shall be paid by the state (section 4a). This provision seeks to
introduce the possibility that the fee of the interpreter will be paid by the state if his or
her services are required because the judge concerned does not understand Frisian.
The Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act does not contain an equivalent provision with
regard to the translation of documents in administrative cases. Nevertheless, it may
reasonably be assumed that the same principle applies here, namely, that translation
costs are borne by the party submitting the document that is to be translated, unless it
is more logical to charge the costs to the state, for example, if the judge cannot read
Frisian. The above-mentioned provision from article 3.2 of the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001) develops this principle. As it happens, the
assistance of an interpreter was not required at any hearings during the 1999-2001
period. 249

7.35

No figures are available concerning the number of administrative cases in which
Frisian is used orally and/or in writing. As previously noted, there are plans to start
collecting data concerning the number and types of cases, including administrative
cases, in which the proceedings are conducted in Frisian and to provide more
information concerning the option of using Frisian in proceedings before the judicial
authorities in the province of Fryslân (cf. section 7.5). The inclusio n of Frisian
language courses in the range of courses offered to members of the judiciary is meant
to promote the use of Frisian in administrative and other cases (cf. sections 7.6, 7.18
and 7.19).

Article 9(2)(b): validity of legal documents

7.36

249

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘not to deny the
validity, as between the parties, of legal documents drawn up within the country solely
because they are drafted in [the Frisian language], and to provide that they can be

Letter dated 7 March 2002 from Leeuwarden district court to the Fryske Akademy.

86

invoked against interested third parties who are not users of [that language] on
condition that the contents of the document are made known to them by the person(s)
who invoke(s) it’.
7.37

The Committee of Experts considers that the relevant Dutch legislation is in accordance
with the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under the European Charter. The
documents referred to in the Charter are generally legally valid. In practice, notaries
have difficulty drawing up notarial deeds in Frisian, due to a lack of up-to-date
Frisian- language model contracts that are based on terminology taken from a Frisianlanguage legal dictionary.

7.38

As previously noted, the specific problem concerning the lack of a Frisian- language
legal dictionary has now been resolved (cf. section 7.3). For this reason, among
others, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no
agreements concerning such a dictionary. In addition, in order to promote the use of
Frisian in legal matters, the Fryske Akademy will translate a book of model contracts
for legal practice that will replace and update the existing book of Frisian- language
model contracts for the notarial profession (see also sections 10.36 and 10.90). 250 The
Fryske Akademy started work on the translation on 1 October 2001. 251 The Covenant
makes no mention of this initiative either.

7.39

In the new Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government
and the province of Fryslân agreed that the provincial executive of Fryslân will over
the next few years give central government concrete indications of where legislation
including the phrase ‘the Dutch language’ can be amended to read ‘the Dutch and
Frisian languages’ (Covenant 3.5). This provision applies, first and foremost, to
official deeds that are entered in public registers, namely, the Commercial Register of
the Chamber of Commerce, the public registers of registered properties maintained by
the Land and Public Registry Agency and the register of births, deaths and
marriages. 252 In this regard, central government and the province of Fryslân agreed in
the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) that
central government will strive to ensure that official deeds can wherever possible be
entered in public registers in the Frisian language at no extra expense to the
originators (Covenant 3.1).

7.40

General speaking, it is fair to say that the basic rule under current legislation is that
Frisian- language deeds that must be entered in a public register require a literal
translation into Dutch. This translation is then entered in the relevant register, and the
Frisian- language deed is appended to it. This applies not only to deeds, but also to
other documents that must be entered in public registers pursuant to statutory

250
251

252

W.J. Nijenhuis, Fryske modellen foar it notariaat, Fryske Akademy, Ljouwert 1979.
The Ministry of Justice has made the sum of €22,689 available for this purpose, the Ministry of the Interior and
Kingdom Relations has pledged a grant of €11,345, and the provincial executive of Fryslân has declared its
willingness to contribute to the production of an updated Frisian-language book of model contracts for legal
practice. The Association of Notaries of the district of Leeuwarden is contributing a sum that is equal to the gra nt
of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.
In fact, the scope of this provision extends beyond the amendment of legislation supporting the use of official
deeds drawn up in Frisian and other languages in legal matters to target Dutch legislation in general. Article 3.5
of the new Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) therefore also proposes to update the 1987
study of the Berie foar it Frysk and the Fryske Akademy, which contains an inventory of language provisions in
Dutch legislation. Updating the 1987 study is also important in view of Article 13(1)(a) of the European Charter
(see sections 11.7 to 11.18).

87

regulations. This basic rule concerning the entry of Frisian- language deeds and
documents in public registers applies unless the law provides otherwise (cf. sections 8
and 10 of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act). 253
7.41

An exception is made to the basic rule described in the previous paragraph in relation
to the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce. The relevant legislation
was recently brought into harmony with article 3.1 of the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001). The deeds of incorporation of public and private
limited companies, as well as the deeds of establishment of associations and
foundations, are entered in the Commercial Register. The legislation was amended
with regard to Frisian associations and foundations (see section 7.42 to 7.44).

7.42

On 1 February 2002, the Act of 22 November 2001, introducing the possibility of
drawing up the constitutions of Frisian associations and foundations in the Frisian
language, entered into force (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2001, 574). The Act
provides that the constitutions of associations and foundations whose registered
offices are located in the province of Fryslân may be drawn up in Frisian and entered
in the relevant public registers, provided a Dutch translation is appended to them. This
final requirement does not apply to associations and institutions conducting all or
almost all of their activities in the province of Fryslân. 254 If an interested party that
does not have command of the Frisian language wishes to receive a Dutch translation
of the deed of establishment of one of the associations and foundations concerned,
that association or foundation will provide a Dutch translation that has been done and
declared equivalent by a notary.

7.43

Pursuant to the Act of 22 November 2001, article 27(2) (associations) and article
286(2) (foundations) of Book Two of the Civil Code now read as follows:
Article 27(2):
The deed shall be executed in the Dutch language. If the association has its registered
office in the province of Fryslân, the deed may be executed in the Frisian language.
An authorisation to enter into such a deed shall be given in writing.
Article 286(2):
The deed shall be executed in the Dutch language. If the foundation has its registered
office in the province of Fryslân, the deed may be executed in the Frisian language.
An authorisation to enter into such a deed shall be given in writing. Foundations may
be established by attested will executed in a language other than Dutch or Frisian. In
such cases, the constitution of the foundation shall be drawn up in the Dutch or
Frisian language.
The constitutions that are part of the deed of establishment of an association or
foundation must comply with a number of legally prescribed requirements, some of
which apply to the use of Frisian (cf. section 11.16).

253
254

For more information on this Act, see section 11.12 of this report.
As soon as the Act of 22 November 2001 entered into force, the foundations Douwe Kalma Stifting and
Slachtemaraton availed themselves of the possibility of adopting Frisian-language constitutions (Leeuwarder
Courant, 1 February 2002). On the same day, the Eftrije association and the Fryske Nasjonale Partij both adopted
Frisian-language constitutions at the offices of Notary Veerman in Buitenpost.

88

7.44

The Act of 22 November 2001 also led to the amendment of the Sworn Translators
Act, 255 by adding three sentences to section 8, subsection 1 of the Act, which read as
follows: ‘Where a Frisian- language notarial deed establishing an association or
foundation or containing the constitution of a similar legal entity is concerned, a
literal Dutch translation that has been done and declared equivalent by the notary who
executed the deed shall suffice. A Dutch translation may be waived if the association
or foundation conducts all or almost all its activities in the province of Fryslân. If an
interested party that does not have command of the Frisian language wishes to receive
a Dutch translation of the deed of establishment of one of the above- mentioned
associations or foundations, the association or foundation concerned shall provide a
Dutch translation that has been done and declared equivalent by a notary.’256

7.45

In accordance with the basic rule described in section 7.40 of this report, section 41 of
the Land Registry Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1989, 186 and 1996, 473)
provides, with regard to the public land registers, that a person who wishes to register
a fact that is described in a foreign- or Frisian- language document must also submit a
literal translation into Dutch of the document that is presented for registration. This
translation must be done and declared equivalent by a sworn translator whose
competence in the language concerned is recognised by the court or, if the document
concerned is a notarial deed in the Frisian language, by the notary who executed the
deed. Section 41, subsection 3 of the Act subsequently provides that the translations
are registered in lieu of the foreign- or Frisian- language documents, which are
retained by the registrar.

7.46

Notwithstanding the basic rule described in section 7.40 of this report, section 8,
subsection 3 of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act provides that deeds intended
for entry in the register of births, deaths and marriages may be drawn up both in
Frisian and in Dutch in municipalities in the province of Fryslân (see section 8.39).

7.47

In addition to the above- mentioned official deeds intended for entry in the public
registers, the following deeds are also relevant in relation to the use of Frisian in legal
matters:
•
official deeds that do not need to be entered in public registers
•
non-notarial instruments.

7.48

The basic rule regarding official deeds that are not intended for entry in public
registers reads as follows:
Notarial deeds that are not intended for entry in public registers may be drawn up in
Frisian at the request of the parties, provided the notary is able to understand and
write Frisian to a satisfactory degree and the witnesses present at the drawing up of
the deed understand Frisian. Such Frisian- language deeds may serve as evidence in
judicial proceedings, where necessary accompanied by a translation.

7.49

255

256

The above- mentioned basic rule is worked out in detail in the new Notaries Act
(Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1999, 190), which entered into force on 1 October 1999.
Section 42, subsection 1 of the Act allows notarial deeds to be drawn up in a foreign

Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1878, 30, most recently amended by the Act of 2 April 1991 (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1991, 199).
For more information o n language provisions in the Land Registry Act, see section 11.13 of this report.

89

language or in Frisian at the request of the parties, provided the notary adequately
understands that language, unless the law determines otherwise. If a party appearing
before the notary does not adequately understand the language of the deed, a sworn
interpreter/translator will also appear, to translate the contents of the deed. The
interpreter/translator also signs the deed, and his or her assistance is noted at the end
of it. Section 42, subsection 2 of the Act allows for the execution of a deed in more
than one language. In such cases, the text in one language is followed by the text in
another language. This provision also applies if the deed is executed in Dutch and
Frisian, or if Frisian is one of the languages in which the deed is executed. 257
7.50

Non-notarial instruments, which include agreements and unilateral declarations of
intent such as rental agreements, receipts and acknowledgements of indebtedness,
may be drawn up in Frisian at the request of the parties or the declarant. 258
A translation is required if a non-notarial instrument is invoked before the court and
the judge cannot read Frisian. In this regard, a Frisian- language non-notarial
instrument does not differ from deeds drawn up in languages other than Dutch. Third
parties may also enter the picture in connection with non- notarial instruments, for
example, in cases of assignment or subrogation. In such cases, authorised translations
are required. This does not appear to present any problems in practice.

7.51

In summary, it appears that Dutch legislation has been brought into line with the
undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under the European Charter since the
publication of the first Dutch periodical report. In the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001), central government and the province of Fryslân have
committed themselves to the joint implementation of the relevant measures.

8

Article 10: Administrative authorities and public services

8.1

During the period covered by this report (1999-2001), no amendments were made to
the legislation on the use of Frisian by administrative authorities and public services.
Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1995,
302) entered into force on 1 July 1995 and provided a statutory basis for the use of
Frisian in administrative matters. The Act stipulates that members of the public are
entitled to speak or write in Frisian when communicating with administrative
authorities located in the province of Fryslân. This entitlement to write in Frisian also
applies to central government bodies or agencies whose purview extends to the
province of Fryslân or parts of it.
In 1992, the Provinces Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1992, 550) and the
Municipalities Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1992, 96) were amended such that,
as of 1 January 1994, the relevant authorities were authorised to adopt the Frisian
name of the province and of each municipality, if necessary in conjunction with the
official Dutch name.

257

258

For more information on the legal consequences of a notarial deed that has been executed in more than one
language, see section 11.11 of this report.
Employment contracts may also be classified as non-notarial instruments. The European Charter considers the
use of regional and minority languages in employment contracts in Article 13(1)(a) (see sections 11.5 and 11.10).

90

Also relevant in this regard is article H 2, paragraph 5 of the Elections Decree
(Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1989, 471), which allows appellations on lists of
candidates for elections to the provincial council or municipal councils in the province
of Fryslân to appear in Frisian.
8.2

In its report, the Committee of Experts encourages central government and the other
authorities concerned to implement section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law
Act by drawing up model regulations or model ordinances covering the use of
Frisian. 259 The Committee also encourages central government to take the necessary
measures to permit the use of Frisian family names in official documents. 260

8.3

The Netherlands is fulfilling the undertakings it entered into on accepting Article 10
of the European Charter, with the exception of the undertaking concerning the use of
Frisian family names. To rectify this shortcoming, central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001) that central government will draft a statutory provision on changes to family
names to enable Frisian names or Frisian spellings to be recognised as official family
names in municipal personal records databases (Covenant 4.7). Central government is
currently drafting an amendment to the Alteration of Surnames Decree to this effect
(see section 8.83).

8.4

In this regard, it is also worth noting that the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom
Relations drafted a model regulation on the use of Frisian in administrative matters
for the benefit of decentralised central government agencies in 1996. In addition, the
province of Fryslân drafted a model ordinance for the benefit of the municipalities in
Fryslân in 1997 (see further section 8.34). In the Covenant on the Frisian Language
and Culture (2001), central government and the province of Fryslân agreed that those
ministries with agencies covering Fryslân will introduce regulations on the use of
Frisian by the agencies concerned by 2004 (Covenant 4.2). 261

8.5

Finally, the following should be noted with regard to legislation concerning the use of
Frisian in administrative matters, as laid down in the General Administrative Law
Act. In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government
and the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that a
second evaluation is conducted of Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act if
there are practical reasons for doing so. Central government will also strive to ensure
that any measures needing to be taken as a result of such an evaluation are indeed
implemented. If necessary, the Act will be amended (Covenant 4.6).

Article 10(1)(a)(v): written use of Frisian by natural and legal persons in their dealings with central government
bodies located in the province of Fryslân

259

260
261

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts (2001), 83. In accordance with Dutch legislation, a
distinction needs to be made between regulations (at national level) and ordinances (at provincial and municipal
level). The relevant ministry can draw up model regulations concerning the use of Fris ian in administrative
matters for central government agencies that are located in the province of Fryslân. The province of Fryslân and
the municipalities can make use of model ordinances for this purpose.
Ibid., 87.
Section 4.2 of the original Dutch version of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) talks about
‘ordinances’ where it obviously means ‘regulations’.

91

8.6

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, as far as reasonably
possible, ‘to ensure that users of [the Frisian language] may validly submit a document
in [this language]’ to central government bodies located in the province of Fryslân. The
statutory basis for this is section 2:7 of the General Administrative La w Act (Bulletin of
Acts and Decrees 1995, 302). Section 2:7, subsection 1 of the Act lays down the basic
rule that members of the public are entitled to use Frisian in their dealings with
administrative authorities, in so far as these are located in the province of Fryslân.
Section 2:7, subsection 2 of the Act subsequently provides that subsection 1 does not
apply in cases where the administrative authority has requested the use of Dutch on
the grounds that the use of Frisian would impose a disproportionate burden on the
administrative process.

8.7

The Committee of Experts considers that central government has fulfilled the
undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under Article 10(1)(a)(v) of the European
Charter. 262

8.8

As the relevant legislation and policies are in accordance with the undertaking entered
into by the Netherlands under the European Charter, the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on this issue.

8.9

In a letter dated 23 January 1996, ref. BW95/U1445, the State Secretary for the
Interior draws the attention of the various ministers whose jurisdictions encompass a
decentralised central government agency located in the province of Fryslân to the new
statutory regulations on the use of Frisian in administrative matters. In the letter, the
State Secretary states explicitly that although section 2:7, subsection 2 of the General
Administrative Law Act authorises administrative authorities to request Frisianspeaking individuals to use Dutch,
‘it should be clear that excessive use of this exception would lead to the erosion,
opposed by the legislature, of the right granted in subsection 1. It is therefore
desirable that a sufficient number of Frisian-speaking employees are available,
especially in department s dealing directly with the public.’
With this statement, the Dutch government supports the purpose of Article 10 of the
European Charter, as formulated in the Explanatory Report. 263

8.10

Two ministries have so far expanded on the language provisions in the General
Administrative Law Act concerning the use of Frisian in dealings between natural and
legal persons, on the one hand, and administrative authorities, on the other. First of
all, the Ministry of Finance has adopted regulations on communication between
individuals and units of the Tax and Customs Administration (see section 8.11). In
addition, the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment has adopted
regulations on environmental reporting (see section 8.12).

8.11

In 1997, the State Secretary for Finance approved the 1997 General Administrative
Law Act Regulations, which apply in particular to communication between
individuals and units of the national tax authorities (Government Gazette 1997, 138).

Council of Europe, European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages: Explanatory Report, section 104.

92

As their name implies, these Regula tions are based on the General Administrative
Law Act. Section 3.1 of the Regulations states that Chapter 2 of the General
Administrative Law Act lays down a number of provisions concerning
communication between individuals and administrative authorities. These provisions,
including the provisions on the use of Dutch and Frisian, apply to all the activities of
the Tax and Customs Administration. Section 5.3.4 of the Regulations provides that,
pursuant to section 2:7 of the General Administrative Law Act, taxpayers are entitled
to use Frisian when submitting applications to tax units located in the province of
Fryslân. Taxpayers are also entitled to submit Frisian-language notices of objection to
tax units located in the province of Fryslân (section 6.1.1 of the Regulations).
8.12

In 1997, the Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment included
provisions on environmental reporting by companies in the Environmental
Management Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1997, 170). Section 12.6 of this Act
takes account of the possibility that companies in the province of Fryslân will draw up
their environmental reports, which under the Act must be made public, in Frisian. In
such cases, a Dutch translation may be requested. If a company draws up an
environmental report for an administrative authority in the province of Fryslân in
Frisian, in accordance with Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act, the
management of the company must provide a Dutch translation on request, in
accordance with section 12.6, subsection 2 of the Environmental Management Act.

Article 10(1)(c): written use of Frisian by central government administrative authorities located in the province
of Fryslân

8.13

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, with regard to central
government bodies located in the province of Fryslân, ‘to allow the administrative
authorities to draft documents in [the Frisian language]’, as far as this is reasonably
possible. The statutory basis for this is sections 2:9, 2:10 and 2:11 of the General
Administrative Law Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1995, 302). These provisions
apply to central government bodies whose purview extends to the province of Fryslân
or parts of it.

8.14

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that Dutch legislation is in accordance
with the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under Article 10(1)(c) of the
European Charter, but that it has not yet been put into practice. According to the
General Administrative Law Act, central government bodies and agencies that fall
within the jurisdiction of a particular ministry and whose purview extends to the
province of Fryslân or part of it are entitled to draw up regulations on the use of
Frisian in written documents. This has not yet been done, and central government
bodies located in Fryslân therefore cannot use Frisian in their outgoing
correspondence. The Committee therefore considers that the Netherlands is not
fulfilling its obligations in this matter. 264

8.15

As previously noted in section 8.4 of this report, in the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001) central government and the province of Fryslân agreed
that those ministries with agencies covering Fryslân will introduce regulations on the
use of Frisian by the agencies concerned (Covenant 4.2).

264

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 83.

93

8.16

Article 104 of the Explanatory Report states that the undertakings entered into by the
member states in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 10 are qualified by the phrase ‘as far
as this is reasonably possible’. This phrase does not change the fact that the
acceptance of a particular provision with respect to a given language necessarily
entails a commitment to provide the resources and make the administrative
arrangements required to render it effective.

8.17

With regard to administrative aut horities located in the province of Fryslân that are
part of central government, section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act lays
down the basic rule that the ministers concerned are authorised to establish rules on
the use of Frisian in written documents for central government bodies whose purview
extends to the province of Fryslân or part of it. Such rules must also be in accordance
with the other provisions of Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act (see also
sections 8.18 and 8.19).

8.18

Section 2:10 of the General Administrative Law Act specifies the cases in which a
written document drafted in Frisian must also be drafted in Dutch.

8.19

Section 2:11 of the General Administrative Law Act lays down rules concerning the
Dutch translation of a written document drafted in Frisian. These rules also apply to
central government bodies whose purview extends to the province of Fryslân or part
of it. The basic principle underlying the rules in section 2:11 is that Dutch translations
will be provided upon request only when the written document is drafted in Frisian. In
principle, the associated translation costs are borne by the party making the request.
In addition, it is worth noting that no third-party costs are attached to the translation of
documents drafted in Frisian that must also be drafted in Dutch, in accordance with
the relevant statutory provision (section 2:10 of the General Administrative Law Act)
(see also section 8.31).

8.20

In order to render section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act effective, central
government has drawn up a model regulation on the use of Frisian in administrative
matters that seeks to lower the threshold for the written use of Frisian by decentralised
central government agencies. The State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom
Relations sent the model regulation to the relevant ministries as an annexe to a letter
dated 23 January 1996, ref. BW95/U1445. This letter informed the ministries
concerned of the new statutory regulations on the use of Frisian in administrative
matters (see section 8.9).

8.21

Thus far, none of the ministers concerned have made use of their statutory powers
under section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act to adopt regulations on the
use of the Frisian language (see section 3.7.7). In the absence of such regulations, a
decentralised central government agency located in the province of Fryslân cannot by
law use Frisian in its outgoing correspondence. 265

265

For the sake of clarity, it is worth noting that this section refers to regulations that enable central government
authorities located in the province of Fryslân to use Frisian. Such regulations do not actually exist at present.
However, as previously noted, there are regulations that enable natural and legal persons to use Frisian in their
dealings with central government bodies located in the province of Fryslân (such as the tax authorities in
Leeuwarden) (see sections 8.10 to 8.12).

94

8.22

In the framework of the implementation of the agreements contained in the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government will devote attention
in the coming years to the implementation of the provisions of article 4.2 of the
Covenant (see section 8.15).

8.23

It is clear that Dutch legislation is in accordance with the undertakings entered into by
the Netherlands concerning the written use of Frisian by central government
administrative authorities. On the basis of section 104 of the Explanatory Report and
certain other factors, however, the Committee of Experts considers that the ministries
concerned have not yet made all the administrative arrangements that are required to
implement the relevant provision of the Charter. As noted in the paragraph above,
article 4.2 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) seeks to
encourage the adoption of such arrangements. In addition, article 4.5 of the Covenant
contains an agreement concerning the need to improve the Frisian language skills of
staff dealing directly with the public in the service of governmental or semigovernmental institutions in the province of Fryslân (such as decentralised central
government agencies). This issue is discussed in greater detail in sections 8.72 and
8.73.

Article 10(2)(a)-(d): use of Frisian in administrative matters by local and regional authorities

8.24

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook the following with
regard to local and regional authorities in the province of Fryslân:
‘to allow and/or encourage:
a
the use of [the Frisian language] within the framework of the regional or local
authority;
b
the possibility for users of [the Frisian language] to submit oral or written
applications in [this language];
c
the publication by regional authorities of their official documents also in [the
Frisian language];
d
the publication by local authorities of their official documents also in [the
Frisian language]’.

8.25

The Committee of Experts considers that these undertakings are being fulfilled.
However, the Committee also encourages the autho rities concerned to make use of the
opportunity provided by section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act to draw
up model ordinances covering the use of Frisian. 266

8.26

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will jointly strive to ensure that by 2003 ten
municipalities in the province of Fryslân will have adopted ordinances for their own
use of Frisian (Covenant 4.1).

8.27

The use of the Frisian language within the framework of the regional and local
authorities is regulated in Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act, in
particular sections 2:7 to 2:11, as well as in section 8, subsection 3 of the Use of
Frisian (Legal Matters) Act.

266

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 84.

95

8.28

As previously noted (see section 8.16), the acceptance by a member state of the
provisions contained in subparagraphs 1 and 3 of Article 10 of the European Charter
necessarily entails a commitment to provide the resources and make the
administrative arrangements required to render it effective. In order to respect the
autonomy of regional and local authorities, a different approach was adopted in the
formulation of subparagraph 2 of the same article. Thus, on accepting a particular
provision from this subparagraph, a member state is not individually bound ‘to
provide the resources and make the administrative arrangements required to render it
effective’, but undertakes, while respecting the principle of local and regional
autonomy, ‘to allow and/or encourage’ the regional and local authorities to apply the
provisions accepted by central government in their own policies. In this regard, the
regional and local authorities possess the requisite amount of policy freedom (see
section 105 of the Explanatory Report).

8.29

The possibility for Frisian-speakers to submit oral or written applications in Frisian to
regional and local authorities in the province of Fryslân is regulated in section 2:7,
subsection 1 of the General Administrative Law Act, which provides that ‘everyone
may use Frisian in their dealings with administrative authorities, in so far as these are
located in the province of Fryslân’. Section 2:7, subsection 2 provides that this basic
rule does not apply ‘in cases where the administrative authority has requested the use
of Dutch on the grounds that the use of Frisian would impose a disproportionate
burden on the administrative process’. With regard to the use of this exception, the
reader is referred to the matters discussed in section 8.9.

8.30

The publication of official documents in Frisian by regional and local authorities is
regulated in section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act, which provides that
‘administrative authorities located in the province of Fryslân that are not part of
central government may make rules on the use of Frisian in written documents’. Such
rules, laid down in provincial or municipal ordinances, must be in accordance with the
other provisions of Part 2.2 of the General Administrative Law Act (see also sections
8.31 and 8.32). Section 8.34 considers the freedom of administrative authorities in the
province of Fryslân to adopt such ordinances on the use of Frisian in written
documents in greater depth.

8.31

Section 2:10 of the General Administrative Law Act stipulates in which cases a
written document drafted in Frisian must also be drafted in Dutch. The associated
translation costs are borne by the administrative authority concerned (see section
8.19).

8.32

Section 2:11 of the General Administrative Law Act lays down rules concerning the
translation into Dutch of written documents drafted in Frisian by the administrative
authorities located in the province of Fryslân. In principle, the associated translation
costs are borne by the party requesting the translation, unless the written document
‘includes a decision or other proceeding which directly concerns the party making the
request’. The level of the translation costs is regulated in the above-mentioned
provincial and regional ordinances (see section 8.30).

8.33

By decree of the provincial council of Fryslân of 4 October 2000, the province of
Fryslân adopted an ordinance on the written use of the Frisian and Dutch languages

96

by administrative authorities in the province of Fryslân (Provincial Bulletin 2000, 75),
thereby implementing section 2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act (see section
8.30).267
8.34

The provincial executive of Fryslân has drafted a model ordinance on the written use
of Frisian in administrative matters for the benefit of the local authorities in the
province of Fryslân, in particular the municipalities and water boards. 268 In the
absence of such an ordinance on the choice of language, a local authority in the
province of Fryslân is not entitled to use Frisian in its outgoing correspondence. In
fact, local authorities in Fryslân are not obliged to introduce policies on the use of
Frisian in administrative matters on the basis of Part 2.2 of the General Administrative
Law Act, for the reasons mentioned in section 8.28. 269 Nevertheless, 19 of the 31
Frisian municipalities have opted to introduce municipal policies concerning the use
of Frisian in administrative matters. Some of the municipalities concerned still lack
the municipal ordinance required under section 2:9 of the General Administrative
Law Act, while others have brought their policies into harmony with the General
Administrative Law Act (cf. sections 8.35 and 8.36).

8.35

Significant progress has already been achieved with regard to the objective, as
expressed in article 4.1 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001),
to ensure that by 2003 ten municipalities in the province of Fryslân will have adopted
ordinances for the use of Frisian in written documents (cf. section 8.26). At present, 7
of the 31 Frisian municipalities have done so, thereby implementing section 2:9 of the
General Administrative Law Act (see section 8.30). 270

8.36

Ten Frisian municipalities have not adopted ordinances on the use of Frisian, but
employ guidelines for the use of Frisian adopted by their municipal councils.271 In

This ordinance replaced the provincial ordinance on the written use of Frisian and Dutch by administrative
authorities in the province of Fryslân, as adopted in 1985 and most recently amended in 1990 (Provincial Bulletin
1985, 82; 1990, 103).

Tytsjerksteradiel and Wûnseradiel (see also annexe 1.3).
At its council meeting of 29 February 1996, the municipality of Achtkarspelen adopted a guideline providing that
Frisian-language correspondence addressed to the municipality should be answered in Frisian. In certain cases,
the municipality is also entitled to draft correspondence in Frisian on its own initiative, after considering the
interests of the addressee and the municipal organisation concerned. Finally, the municipality may also draft
council proposals, policy documents and other documents concerning the Frisian language or issues of a Frisian
nature in Frisian, while respecting the provisions of the General Administrative Law Act.
The municipality of het Bildt employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence should be
answered in Frisian.
The municipality of Dongeradeel employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence
should be answered in Frisian.
The municipality of Heerenveen employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence should
be answered in Frisian.
The municipality of Leeuwarden employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence should
be answered in Frisian.
In its memorandum on the use of Frisian of September 1996, the municipality of Leeuward eradeel provides
that Frisian-language correspondence addressed to the municipal executive should be answered in Frisian as often
as possible. In addition, where possible, council documents should also be drawn up in Frisian. The municipality
further strives to place Frisian-language advertisements and draft correspondence in Frisian on its own initiative
to persons and bodies whose command of Frisian is known to the municipality.

97

doing so, they are not acting in accordance with section 2:9, subsection 1 of the
General Administrative Law Act (see section 8.30). A further fifteen Frisian
municipalities have adopted a policy plan or memorandum on the use of Frisian. 272
The failure of a number of Frisian municipalities to adopt ordinances on the use of
Frisian is being addressed in the framework of the implementation of the Covenant on
the Frisian Language and Culture (2001).
8.37

On 12 October 2000, the Berie foar it Frysk organised a one-day seminar in
Oranjewoud in support of municipal language and cultural policies. This was
followed by the publication of a report of the seminar, supplemented by examples of
language ordinances. 273
Finally, as an example of modern municipal language policy, it is worth noting that all
Frisian municipalities have a presence on the internet. Four of these municipalities
offer Frisian-language web pages in addition to Dutch- language pages. 274

8.38

None of the six water boards in Fryslân has adopted an ordinance on the use of Frisian
and Dutch.

8.39

Section 8, subsection 3 of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1995, 440), which entered into force on 1 January 1997, provides that deeds
intended for entry in the register of births, deaths and marriages may be drawn up
both in Frisian and in Dutch. In connection with the amendment of the Act, the 1994
Births, Deaths and Marriages (Registration) Decree was amended by decree of 27
August 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1996, 445). As of 1 January 1997,
municipalities in the province of Fryslân are able to draw up deeds intended for entry
in the register of births, deaths and marriages in Frisian and Dutch. The marriage
booklets issued by the municipalities are now also bilingual (see section 7.46).

8.40

Article H 2, paragraph 5 of the Elections Decree (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1989,
471; 1997, 712) allows appellations on candidate lists in the province of Fryslân to
appear in Frisian: ‘where the election of the members of the provincial council of
Fryslân or the municipal councils in the province of Fryslân is concerned, appellations

274

The municipality of Opsterland employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence should
be answered in Frisian.
In a letter dated 21 March 2002 to the Fryske Akademy, ref. 02-1626/SAZ/YH/TL, the municipality of
Smallingerland notes that it has a rule to the effect that Frisian-language correspondence should be answered in
Frisian. The matter is regulated in a policy document containing basic principles for the use of Frisian in the
municipality of Smallingerland. Incidentally, the municipality’s letter, which is written in Dutch, was sent in
reply to a written q uestion in the Frisian language!
The municipality of Sneek employs a guideline providing that Frisian-language correspondence should be
answered in Frisian.
The municipality of Wymbritseradiel answers Frisian-language correspondence in Frisian and also drafts
documents in Frisian on its own initiative.
The municipalities of Achtkarspelen, Dantumadeel, Ferwerderadiel, Franekeradeel, Heerenveen, Leeuwarden,
Leeuwarderadeel, Menaldumadeel, Opsterland, Skarsterlân, Smallingerland, Sneek, Wymbritseradiel and
Tytsjerksteradiel adopted a policy plan or policy document on the Frisian language after 1984. The municipality
of het Bildt adopted a policy document on the use of the Bildt dialect and Frisian in the municipality.

In 2001, AFUK’s Frisian Language Support Centre, Stipepunt Frysk, launched a new project to assist
municipalities in the use of Frisian on their websites. As a result, the municipalities of Achtkarspelen,
Ferwerderadiel, Smallingerland and Wûnseradiel now provide Frisian-language information on the internet. In
addition, the municipality of Menaldumadeel devotes a few sentences in Frisian to its Frisian language policies.

98

on the candidate lists may appear in Frisian’. The candidates of the Fryske Nasjonale
Partij regularly avail themselves of this legal possibility, while the candidates of other
parties do so only rarely. A few parties also participate in municipal or provincial
council elections under their Frisian names.
8.41

In 1996, at the request of the Ministry of Justice, the Fryske Akademy’s Language
Desk translated all the deeds in the book of model documents of the Dutch
Association of Population Affairs into Frisian. In addition, all the municipalities in the
province of Fryslân have received a software package of bilingual deeds in order to
facilitate the implementation of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act.

8.42

In the light of the above, it appears that the Netherlands has adopted the necessary
statutory measures to implement Article 10(2)(a)-(d) of the European Charter, while
respecting the principle of local and regional autonomy. In the framework of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed that attention should be devoted in the coming years to the
adoption by each municipality of its own ordinance concerning the written use of
Frisian, as various municipalities are currently not acting in accordance with section
2:9 of the General Administrative Law Act. In addition, article 4.5 of the Covenant
contains an agreement concerning the need to improve the Frisian language skills of
staff dealing directly with the public in the service of governmental or semigovernmental institutions in the province of Fryslân (province, municipalities and
water boards). This issue is discussed in more depth in sections 8.72 and 8.73.

Article 10(2)(e)-(f): use of Frisian in meetings of regional and local authorities located in the province of
Fryslân

8.43

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook the following with
regard to the regional and local authorities in the province of Fryslân
‘to allow and/or encourage:
e
the use by regional authorities of [the Frisian language] in debates in their
assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of
the State;
f
the use by local authorities of [the Frisian language] in debates in their
assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of
the State.’

8.44

The Committee of Experts considers that the above-mentioned undertakings are being
fulfilled. 275

8.45

As Dutch legislation and policy are in accordance with the undertakings entered into by
the Netherlands under the European Charter, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) contains no agreements in this regard.

8.46

The use of Frisian in meetings of administrative authorities located in the province of
Fryslân is regulated in section 2:12 of the General Administrative Law Act. According
to section 2:12, what is said in Frisian must also be recorded in Frisian in the minutes.

275

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 84.

99

8.47

Barring certain statutory exceptions, the administrative authorities may charge a fee for
the translation of the minutes of such meetings that may not exceed the cost of the
translation. The level of the translations costs is regulated in provincial and municipal
ordinances, as discussed in sections 8.30 to 8.35. No fee is charged for the translation
into Dutch of minutes drawn up in Frisian if the party requesting the translation has a
direct interest in the content of those minutes or if the minutes concern the adoption of
generally binding regulations or policy rules (section 2:11, subsection 3 (a) of the
General Administrative Law Act).

8.48

The Netherlands has thus taken the necessary statutory measures to bring its legislation
into harmony with the undertakings entered into under the European Charter.

Article 10(2)(g): adoption of place names

8.49

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook with regard to the
regional and local authorities in the province of Fryslân
‘to allow and/or encourage:
g
the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the official
language(s), of traditional and correct forms of place names in [the Frisian
language].’

8.50

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that Dutch legislation is in keeping with
the undertaking entered into under Article 10(2)(g) of the European Charter, although
full implementation is still lacking. In this regard, the Committee points out the absence
of a requirement to provide bilingual street, village and municipality signs, noting that
such decisions are left to the municipality concerned. The Committee considers that this
undertaking is only partially fulfilled and calls on the Dutch government to encourage
the relevant municipality authorities to introduce bilingual signs.276

8.51

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that all government institutions, including the
decentralised central government agencies, will use the official Fris ian names of
municipalities and places in Fryslân when drafting documents or addressing
correspondence (Covenant 4.3) (see also sections 11.28 to 11.30). In practice, this is
already the case.

8.52

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no provisions on
bilingual street, village and municipality signs for two reasons. The first reason is that
the relevant provision in the European Charter does not contain a requirement to this
effect. In actual fact, the Netherlands is bound ‘to allow and/or encourage’ the use of
Frisian place names. This requirement has been complied with in full, as the use of
bilingual signs has already been permitted for some time. A substantial number of
municipalities in the province of Fryslân have placed bilingual signs at the outer limits
of built-up areas. At present, the placement of such signs is facilitated by the Regulation
implementing the Administrative Provisions (Road Traffic) Decree 277 with respect to
traffic signs (Government Gazette 1997, 239). Paragraph 3, point 15 of the regulations
provides that road signs are generally produced in accordance with the NEN 3381

276
277

Ibid., 85.
Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1990, 460.

100

standard (Traffic signs: General rules regarding road signs). Section 4.3.2 of the NEN
3381 standard provides that, in the province of Fryslân, signs indicating the beginning
or end of a built-up area may display Frisian- language place names in addition to the
official names. If the official place name is already in Frisian, that name by itself will
suffice.
8.53

The second reason why the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001)
contains no provisions on bilingual signs is that, in the opinion of the government,
there is no need for further policies encouraging this practice, as local authorities are
already making full use of their freedom of action in this regard in relation to town,
village and street signs (see further sections 8.64 and 8.65).

8.54

With regard to regional authorities, section 156 of the Provinces Act (Bulletin of Acts
and Decrees 1992, 550) provides that provincial councils can change the name of the
provinces they govern. On 13 December 1995, the provincial council of Friesland
made use of this possibility to change the official name of the province from Friesland
to Fryslân, as of 1 January 1997 (Provincial Bulletin 1996, 7).

8.55

With regard to local authorities, section 158 of the Municipalities Act (Bulletin of
Acts and Decrees 1992, 96) provides that municipal councils can change the name of
the municipalities they govern. By virtue of this provision, which came into force on
1 January 1994, municipalities in the province of Fryslân can decide to adopt Frisian
names. The Act of 24 October 1984 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 475) previously
granted this power to municipalities that are created as a result of the redrawing of
municipal boundaries and acquire their names by means of a boundary reform act
(previously section 53 of the Local Government Boundary Reform (General
Regulations) Act). Eight new municipalities, created on 1 January 1983 as a result of
the municipal reorganisation of Fryslân, made use of this opportunity to adopt official
Frisian names. They are the municipalities of Boarnsterhim, Gaasterlân-Sleat,
Littenseradiel, Nijefurd, Skarsterlân, Tytsjerksteradiel, Wûnseradiel and
Wymbritseradiel. 278 In 1996, on the basis of section 158 of the Municipalities Act, the
municipal council of Ferwerderadeel decided to change the official name of the
municipality to Ferwerderadiel, as of 1 January 1999.

8.56

The power to name villages, towns, streets, squares and so forth belongs to the
municipalities. In 1953, the Dutch government clarified once and for all that the
municipalities in the province of Fryslân are authorised to adopt the Frisian name,
possibly in conjunction with the Dutch name, of towns and villages located on their
territory. This power also extends to the naming of streets, squares and so forth. 279

8.57

Four municipalities in the province of Fryslân have used this power to officially adopt
Frisian names for towns and villages located on their territory, namely, Boarnsterhim,
Ferwerderadiel, Littenseradiel and Tytsjerksteradiel. In the other municipalities, the
official names of the towns and villages are in Dutch, with the exception of a number
of cases in which certain municipalities decided to adopt official Frisian names: Nij
Beets (1950), Koufurderrige (c. 1950), De Tike (1952), De Knipe (1970), Boksum

278

279

In addition, the official Dutch name of the municipalities of Achtkarspelen and Weststellingwerf does not differ
from the Frisian-language versions of those names.
Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 1953-1954, 3321, no. 1.

101

(1972), It Heidenskip (1979) and Jonkerslân (1988). There is no difference between
the Frisian and Dutch versions of a substantial number of place names in Fryslân. 280
8.58

Central government and its administrative authorities use the official names adopted
by the province and the municipalities for town and villages, streets, squares and so
forth. In cases in which local authorities have decided to adopt two official names –
one in Frisian and one in Dutch – central government and its administrative
authorities exclusively use the Dutch name.

8.59

In accordance with government policy, all central government agencies and other
central government administrative authorities must use official place names when
drafting documents or addressing correspondence. This policy is based on the
Personal Data (Standard Spelling) Decree of 1 September 1992. 281 This decree
requires ministries and central gove rnment agencies to adapt their methods of
addressing correspondence to the NEN standards, which, among other things, list the
official names of municipalities, towns and villages. If official Frisian names have
been adopted, ministries and central government agencies must use the Frisian names.

8.60

As far as can be ascertained, all ministries and central government agencies now
comply with the above- mentioned policy, in contrast to the situation at the time of the
first periodical report. This means that – in contrast to what was stated in section 6.37
of the first report – central government agencies, such as the Tax and Customs
Administration, the organ donors registry of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and
Sport and the Central Fine Collection Agency, are currently complying with the
policy laid down in the decree of 1 September 1992. These developments are
connected to the fact that Dutch postal service PTT Post has recently started using
official place names in its databases, even if the only official place name is in
Frisian. 282

8.61

The government’s position paper of 1953 does not discuss the power to name lakes,
canals and other waterways, or rural areas (see section 8.56). In fact, the power to
name lakes, canals and other waterways has still not been regulated explicitly. 283 In
theory, it falls under municipal and provincial self- government, with the possible
exception of the naming of national waterways. 284 With regard to lakes, canals and
other waterways, local authorities are thus entitled to adopt official names in Frisian
or in Dutch, or in both languages. The same policy freedom applies with regard to
engineering structures – especially bridges – on Frisian waterways, where the relevant
municipalities or administrators have replaced existing names with Frisian names in
recent years. 285 For the purpose of creating a cultural heritage map, as well as a public
map, the provincial authority of Fryslân is preparing a list of Frisian-language names

At a meeting on 24 April 1985, at which it considered the final report ‘Frysk yn it offisjele ferkear’ and the subreport of the committee on the Frisian language, the provincial council of Fryslân not only decided to change the
name of the province of Friesland to the province of Fryslân, but also to change the Dutch names of waterways
and canals to Frisian names. This decision has subsequently not been implemented.

of waterways in the province of Fryslân, although the adoption of such names was not
discussed during the 1999-2001 period.
8.62

Five of the six Frisian water boards, which were all established between 1990 and
1995, are known by their Frisian names. 286 Following the province of Fryslân’s
change of name, the Friesla nd water board, which is responsible for water quality and
sea defences, changed its name to Wetterskip Fryslân, as of 1 September 1998. 287

8.63

The province of Fryslân’s change of name was also emulated by the Cabinet, which
decided to officially change the name of the Police Region of Friesland to the Police
Region of Fryslân in December 2001. The change became effective on 1 July 2002.

8.64

It appears that Dutch legislation is in accordance with the relevant undertakings
entered into by the Netherlands. Municipalities are already entitled to use bilingual
signs, regardless of whether the official place name is in Dutch or Frisian. Almost all
the municipalities in the Frisian language area of the province of Fryslân have placed
bilingual signs at the outer limits of built-up areas. There is therefore no need for
additional government encouragement of local authorities to use bilingual signs, as
recommended by the Committee of Experts.

8.65

Some municipalities in the province of Fryslân also use bilingual street signs. In such
cases, however, the official Dutch name is still used in administrative matters and in
the address files of organisations such as PTT Post (now TPG Post), in accordance
with the government’s position paper of 1953, unless the municipality concerned has
explicitly determined that the Frisian name is to be used as the official name. In
practice, Frisian municipalities generally opt for monolingual street signs in either
Dutch or Frisian. In the opinion of the Dutch government, the policy freedom of the
Frisian municipalities is of fundamental importance in this regard, in the light of the
principle of local self- government endorsed by the Netherlands when it ratified the
European Charter of Local Self- Government of 1985. For this reason, among others,
the Dutch government does not welcome the recommendation of the Committee of
Experts to encourage the relevant municipal authorities in Fryslân to use bilingual
street signs. Moreover, Article 10(2) of the European Charter does not explicitly refer
to bilingual street signs.

Article 10(4)(a) and (c): additional measures

8.66

On accepting the European Charter, with a view to putting into effect those provisions
of Article 10(1), (2) and (3) it had accepted, the Netherlands undertook to take the
following measures:
‘a
c

286

287

translation or interpretation as may be required;
compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of [the Frisian language] to be appointed in the territory in
which that language is used.’

These are the water boards of Boarn en Klif (Joure), Fryslân (Leeuwarden), Lauwerswâlden (Buitenpost), MarneMiddelsee (Bolsward) and De Waadkant (Stiens). The sixth water board is known by the Dutch name of
Sevenwolden (Gorredijk).
On 19 December 2001, the provincial council of Fryslân decided to reorganise the Frisian system of water
boards. The intention is that there will eventually be a single water board for the whole of Fryslân.

103

8.67

The Committee of Experts considers that the undertakings entered into by the
Netherlands under Article 10(4)(a) and (c) are being fulfilled. 288

8.68

As Dutch legislation and policy are in accordance with the undertakings entered into
under the European Charter, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001)
contains no agreements in this regard.

8.69

The Netherlands has adopted a number of statutory measures with regard to translation
and interpretation services, as referred to in Article 10(4)(a) of the European Charter.
Provisions regarding translation appear in sections 2:10 and 2:11 of the General
Administrative Law Act (see also sections 8.19, 8.31, 8.32 and 8.47 of this report).

8.70

Section 6.44 of the first Report on the measures adopted by the Netherlands in respect
of the Frisian language and culture considers how the measures referred to in Article
10(4)(c) of the European Charter should be reported. The number of requests from
public service employees having a knowledge of the Frisian language to be appointed in
the territory in which that language is used, as well as the levels of compliance or noncompliance with such requests, are not known. There is no central location where the
submission and handling of such requests can be registered.

8.71

The Netherlands decided not to accept Article 10(4)(b) of the European Charter,
which concerns the recruitment and, where necessary, training of the required
officials and public service employees, for the reasons stated during its exchange of
views with the House of Representatives. 289 However, the government took this
opportunity to state its willingness ‘to encourage vigorously the implementation of the
measures mentioned in the provision’. In view of this undertaking, the periodical
reports on the implementation of the European Charter are an appropriate forum to
report on the measures taken by the Netherlands in this regard.

8.72

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will jointly strive to ensure that staff dealing
directly with the public in the service of governmental or semi- governmental
institutions in the province of Fryslân (province, municipalities, decentralised central
government agencies, water boards) will be offered courses to improve their active
knowledge of the Frisian language (Covenant 4.5).

8.73

Between 1998 and 2002, various public service employees in the province of Fryslân
took advantage of the opportunity to improve their knowledge of Frisian at their
employer’s expense, by means of AFUK’s courses on Frisian reading and
comprehension, an intensive course on reading, comprehension and speaking, a
Frisian immersion course organised every year on Terschelling and the Frisian A, B
and C courses.
In 1998-1999, twenty public service employees took one of the above- mentioned
Frisian language courses, including five that took the immersion course on
Terschelling. In 1999-2000, the corresponding numbers were thirteen and six, in
2000-2001, fifteen and three and, in 2001-2002, seventeen and eight.

104

The authors of this report do not possess information regarding the manner in which
municipalities, decentralised central government agencies and water boards are
currently implementing the above- mentioned provision from the Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture (2001).
8.74

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that
measures are taken to improve the command of Frisian among police officers in the
province of Fryslân. To achieve this, police officers will be offered courses to
improve their active and passive knowledge of the language (Covenant 4.4).

8.75

In this context, it is also worth noting the Frisian language courses for members and
employees of the judiciary in the province of Fryslân (see sections 7.18 and 7.19).

Article 10(5): Frisian family names

8.76

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to allow the use or
adoption of family names in [the Frisian language], at the request of those concerned’.

8.77

In its report, the Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands has not fulfilled
the undertaking it entered into under Article 10(5) of the European Charter, although
the Committee has been informed that the government is looking into widening the
scope for changing family names. 290

8.78

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that
statutory provision will be made to enable Frisian names or Frisian spellings to be
recognised as official family names in the appropriate cases (Covenant 4.7). Central
government is currently implementing this commitment (see section 8.83).

8.79

In the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill approving the European
Charter, the government stated that some of the provisions of the Charter are entirely
self-evident for the Netherlands. As an example of this, the government mentions the
right of people to use family names in a regional or minority language, in accordance
with Article 10(5) of the Charter. 291

8.80

In this context, it is worth noting that people generally use their official name in the
Netherlands. Basically, a person’s official name is the one that appears in the registers
of births, deaths and marriages (birth certificate). The municipal personal records
database is based on the information contained in deeds that have been deposited in
these registers, including information concerning a person’s family name and the
name of his or her spouse (or ex-spouse) or registered partner (or ex-partner). 292 On
the basis of Article 9 of Book I of the Civil Code, a person is entitled to use the family
name of his or her spouse (or ex-spouse) or registered partner (or ex-partner) instead
of, or in combination with, his or her own family name. The name in question may be

Cf. section 34 of the Municipal Database (Personal Records) Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1994, 494) and
paragraph 10 of Annexe I of the Act, as amended on 17 December 1997 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1997, 660).

105

registered in the municipal personal records database, so that the municipality is able
to address correspondence to the person concerned using this name. Apart from that, a
person may not request to be registered in the municipal personal records database
under a name that is different to his or her official name (i.e. a pseudonym).
8.81

In view of the rule that, as such, a person is free to use a name that is not his or her
official name, people are also free to use family names in the Frisian language. In
general, however, administrative authorities will address correspondence to a person
using his or her official name or, at his or her request, the name of his or her spouse
(or ex-spouse) or registered partner (or ex-partner), or a combination of the two, as
this makes use of information contained in the municipal personal records database.
At present, any request falling outside the above- mentioned parameters to be
registered in a municipal personal records database under a Frisian name and to
receive correspondence from the municipality under that name is still inadmissible
(see section 8.83 below).

8.82

At his or her own request, or at the request of a legal representative, a person’s family
name may be changed by the Crown, pursuant to article 7, paragraph 1 of Book I of
the Civil Code. The Decree of 6 October 1997 containing rules relating to changes to
family names also contains rules on official changes to family names (Bulletin of Acts
and Decrees 1997, 463). As yet, these rules do not allow people to change a Dutch
family name to a Frisian family name, or to adapt or change the Dutch spelling of a
Frisian family name to the Frisian spelling of that name.

8.83

On 22 March 2002, the cabinet adopted a proposal to bring legislation on family
names into harmony with the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands under the
European Charter. 293 As a result, the above-mentioned decree is currently being
amended. The intention is to allow people that used to bear Frisian family names that
were changed to Dutch family names against their will to revert to their original
Frisian names. In addition, people may request to change family names that are of
Frisian origin, but which in the past were registered according to Dutch spelling rules.
In such cases, the application of Frisian spelling rules is still possible through the
submission of an application to change those names. Examples of such family names
include Sytsma, Sudema and Tsjepkema, which were written as Sijtsma, Zuidema and
Tjepkema under Dutch spelling rules.

8.84

In summary, it appears that Dutch legislation is in accordance with the undertakings
entered into by the Netherlands under Article 10 of the European Charter, with the
exception of the Decree of 6 October 1997 containing rules relating to changes to
family names. However, the cabinet has meanwhile decided to amend the decree in
question and has set the necessary procedure in motion.
With regard to the other provisions of Article 10 accepted by the Netherlands, the
attention of the Dutch government, in cooperation with the provincial authority of
Fryslân, is focused on the implementation of the relevant measures and the requisite
preconditions. In this context, it is worth noting the regulations on the use of Frisian
by central government agencies covering the province of Fryslân that await adoption
by various ministries. Central government and the province of Fryslân will also

293

106

jointly encourage the Frisian municipalities to adopt similar rules in the form of
ordinances at municipal level. In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture
(2001), central government and the province of Fryslân concluded a number of
agreements in this regard.

Article 11: Media

9.1

In the Netherlands, public broadcasting, including regional and local broadcasting,
and private broadcasting are legally regulated by the Media Act (Bulletin of Acts and
Decrees 1987, 249, most recently amended on 22 February 2001) and the Media
Decree (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1992, 617, most recently amended on 24 August
2001). Section 9 of the Media Act notes the existence of the Media Aut hority. The
Authority allocates broadcasting time on request, monitors compliance with the
relevant legislation and financially supervises public broadcasting.
The Media Decree is an order in council that implements the provisions of the Media
Act.

9.2

During the current reporting period (1999-2001), the Media Act was substantially
amended in connection with the introduction of a new system of concessions for
national public broadcasting. These amendments came into force partly on 31 March
2000 and partly at a later date (see Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2000, 138 and 139)
and are informally referred to as the Concessions Act. The amendment also provides
that, as of 1 September 2000, regional public broadcasting organisations can apply for
financial assis tance from the Dutch Cultural Broadcasting Promotion Fund.
Previously, such assistance was exclusively available to national television channels.
This amendment of the Media Act applies to Article 11(f)(ii) of the European Charter,
as endorsed by the Netherlands (see section 9.36 et seq.).

9.3

In its report, the Committee of Experts encourages the Dutch government to take into
account the special needs of public broadcasting in Frisian and to consider increasing
its financial support. The Committee further encourages the government to promote
the use of Frisian in commercial broadcasting. 294
In its response to these recommendations, the Dutch government makes a number of
observations. With regard to the first recommendation, it points out that the report
does not contain a proper explanation of the Committee’s position. The government
also goes on to note that it regards existing funding for the production of regional
television and the broadcast of Frisian- language television programmes via one of the
national television channels as sufficient. With regard to the second recommendation,
the government notes that the Netherlands has opted to refrain from imposing any
further requirements in the field of commercial broadcasting, as the guiding principle
of Dutch broadcasting policy is that the Netherlands does not seek in any way to
promote commercial broadcasting. Thus, for example, commercial broadcasting
organisations cannot apply for assistance from the Dutch Cultural Broadcasting
Promotion Fund. 295

The Dutch government’s response appears in Appendix II of the report of the Committee of Experts (pp. 31-32).

107

9.4

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed, in view of the fact that Frisian is the second national
language, that central government will strive to ensure that the regional public
televisio n broadcasting organisation (Omrop Fryslân TV) has sufficient funds to
achieve a full and varied range of programmes (Covenant 5.1) (see section 9.13). The
Covenant contains no agreements on promoting the use of Frisian in commercial radio
and television broadcasts (see section 9.32).

9.5

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands did not endorse any provisions
on the written media (cf. Article 11(1)(e), (f) or (g) of the Charter). In the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), however, central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed that they will jointly strive to ensure that adequate
resources will be made available to ensure the fullest and most varied possible range
of written media in the Frisian language (Covenant 5.5). At present, the
implementation of this agreement still needs to be developed. Where ‘written media’
refers to newspapers and magazines, publishers may submit applications for financial
support to the Netherlands Press Fund, which will assess whether such applications fit
into the Fund’s sphere of activities as defined in the Media Act, particularly section
129 of the Act.

Article 11(1)(a)(iii): public broadcasting (radio and television)

9.6

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, for the users of the
Frisian language in the province of Fryslân, ‘to the extent that the public authorities,
directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role in this field, and
respecting the principle of the independence and autonomy of the media:
a
to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service mission:
(iii)
to make adequate provision so that broadcasters offer programmes in the
[Frisian language].’
In the Netherlands, public broadcasting takes place at national, regional and local level.

9.7

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that Omrop Fryslân produces television
programmes in Frisian for national television channels. These programmes account
for 31 hours of television per year. The programmes are produced by Omrop Fryslân
and broadcast by the Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation (NOS).296 The
programmes are intended partly for the general public and partly for school television
broadcasts. 297

9.8

The Committee of Experts also notes that, as a regional public broadcasting
organisation, Omrop Fryslân broadcast one hour of Frisian- language television
programmes and eight hours of Frisian-language radio programmes per day at the end
of 2000. 298 The Committee further notes that Omrop Fryslân receives exactly the

296
297
298

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 88.
Broadcasting time has now increased to 37 hours of television programmes per year (see section 9.10).
The number of hours of radio programmes per day has meanwhile increased substantially: 18 hours per day from
Mondays to Fridays and 14 hours per day on Saturdays and Sundays. Research indicates that the majority of these
programmes are in Frisian (see also section 9.21).

108

same funding for these programmes as other regional broadcasting organisations in
the Netherlands. 299
9.9

In the opinion of the Committee of Experts, it is entirely reasonable to take into
account the special needs of broadcasting in Frisian and to consider increasing its
financial support. 300 Against this background, the Committee of Experts considers that
the Dutch government is complying with the provision accepted by the Netherlands
under Article 11(1)(a)(iii) of the European Charter, but nevertheless points out the
necessity of earmarking special funding for Frisian- language programmes, so that
Omrop Fryslân can perform its special task in this regard. 301 These issues were taken
into account in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (cf. section
9.13).

9.10

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on
the number of hours of Frisian- language television programmes for the general public
broadcast on national public television channels, as central government and the
province of Fryslân concluded such agreements on an earlier occasion. 302 On the basis
of these earlier agreements, except during the summer months, Omrop Fryslân
produces a 30- minute television programme that is broadcast on Sundays on
Netherlands 1 and repeated between 19:00 and 24:00 on the regional channel. These
broadcasts amount to 21 hours of television per year. Finally, Omrop Fryslân
produces a total of 16 hours and 8 minutes of school television that is broadcast on
Netherlands 3 in more or less weekly segments of 20 minutes. At present, therefore,
over 37 hours of Frisian- language television programmes are broadcast annually on
national television channels.

9.11

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that 16
hours of Frisian- language school television programmes will be provided by the
Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation (NOS) and broadcast nationally. These
programmes are intended for primary education and the lower years of secondary
education. They will be produced within the profile and budget of the NOS and will
be assessed in the light of the basic premises of the public broadcasting system

299

300

301
302

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 88-89. Since mid-1998, Omrop Fryslân is entitled to
distribute its programmes outside the province of Fryslân, in contrast to the other regional broadcasting
organisations in the Netherlands, on the basis of section 64a, subsection 2 of the Media Act. In practice, however,
it appears that only a few cable channels outside the province of Fryslân make use of this opportunity to
broadcast Omrop Fryslân’s programmes. This led the provincial authority of Fryslân to ask the State Secretary for
Education, Culture and Science, in a letter dated 17 June 1999, to include Omrop Fryslân’s programmes in the
requirement under section 82i of the Media Act that obliges television channels to broadcast certain programmes.
The State Secretary rejected this request in a letter dated 16 July 1999 on the grounds that it was too severe a
means to achieve the goal concerned. In particular, the compulsory broadcast of Omrop Fryslân’s programmes
would reduce the choices of the programming committees concerned to just a few channels (see section 10.96).
With regard to television programmes, in particular, the province of Fryslân emphasises that it is more expensive
to produce programmes in Fris ian than it is to produce programmes in Dutch, especially since Omrop Fryslân
must strive to achieve a full and varied range of programmes because of its unique position as the only Frisianlanguage public broadcasting channel in the Netherlands. As a result, Omrop Fryslân incurs additional expenses
in comparison to other regional television channels.

109

(Covenant 5.6). It is the ambition of central government that this objective will be
achieved by 2004. 303
9.12

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on
the number of hours of broadcasting time to which Omrop Fryslân is entitled in its
capacity as a regional broadcasting organisation. This is discussed in greater detail in
section 9.21.

9.13

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that, in view of the fact that Frisian is the second
national language, central government will strive to ensure that Omrop Fryslân TV
has sufficient funds to achieve a full and varied range of programmes (Covenant 5.1).

9.14

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on
the supply of Frisian- language programmes by local broadcasters, as central
government has no say in the content of local broadcasting. Even so, various local
public broadcasting organisations are active in the province of Fryslân (see sections
9.26 to 9.28), and the Media Act requires that they devote at least 50 per cent of their
television broadcasting time to original programming in Dutch or Frisian (see section
9.15).

9.15

With regard to the use of Dutch and Frisian, the Media Act lays down a number of
requirements for television programmes that are relevant to this report. Thus, for
example, section 54a, subsection 1 of the Media Act provides that organisations that
have been allocated broadcasting time must devote at least 50 per cent of their
television broadcasting time to original programming in Dutch or Frisian. Such
programming does not include programmes that are subtitled in or dubbed into Dutch
or Frisian. Mixed programmes, such as a daily television news programme, count
towards this requirement in their entirety, unless the Dutch or Frisian language
occupies a very marginal position in the programme concerned (cf. Bulletin of Acts
and Decrees 1992, 334, p. 28). 304 The provision in section 54a, subsection 1 of the
Media Act applies to public broadcasting as a whole, that is to say, both to the
national channels and to regional and local broadcasting organisations. 305 In a recent
development, the Media Authority has drawn up policy rules that further develop this
provision (cf. section 9.16 et seq.).

9.16

On 18 December 2001, the Media Authority adopted a regulation containing policy
rules relating to European, independent, recent, programming in Dutch or Frisian

303

304

305

In 2000, the number of hours of Frisian-language school television programmes increased from 10 to 16. Section
5.6 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) mistakenly notes that 37 hours of Frisianlanguage school television programmes will be produced for the lower years of secondary education during the
period until 2004.
In addition, the third paragraph of the introduction to chapter 5 of the Covenant mistakenly notes that the package
of Frisian-language programmes broadcast by the Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation (NOS) includes ‘six
hours of school television programmes for primary education and six hours for the lower years of secondary
education in Fryslân’. This should read: ‘ten hours’ for primary education and ‘six hours’ for the lower years of
secondary education.
The calculation of the percentage of programming in Dutch or Frisian does not include broadcasting time devoted
to advertising. On the use of Frisian in advertising, see sections 11.25 and 11.26.
A similar provision applies to commercial broadcasting. This is regulated in article 52l of the Media Decree (cf.
sections 9.33 and 9.34).

110

(Policy Rules on Programme Quotas). 306 Article 6 of these rules provides that the
following programmes, among others, qualify as original programming in Dutch or
Frisian within the meaning of section 54a, subsection 1 of the Media Act and article
52l, paragraph 1 of the Media Decree:307
1a
programmes recorded in Dutch or Frisian;
1b
programmes containing segments from non-Dutch or non-Frisian programmes
that are introduced in Dutch or Frisian by a presenter;
2
Programmes that have been dubbed in Dutch or Frisian do not qualify as
original programming in Dutch or Frisian within the meaning of section 54a,
subsection 1 of the Media Act and article 52l, paragraph 1 of the Media
Decree.
9.17

According to article 8 of the Policy Rules on Programme Quotas:
1
The achieved percentage of original programming in Dutch or Frisian within
the meaning of section 54 of the Media Act and article 52l of the Media
Decree 308 is calculated on the basis of the total available broadcasting time on
each channel per year.
2
Repeats of earlier broadcasts are included in the calculation of the achieved
percentage of original programming in Dutch or Frisian.

9.18

The Media Act also contains a number of provisions that apply specifically to
regional and local broadcasting. As the activities of Omrop Fryslân focus mainly on
regional broadcasting, this report now examines a few of these provisions. On the
allocation of broadcasting time, see sections 9.19 to 9.21, on the funding of regional
broadcasting, see sections 9.22 and 9.23.

9.19

Section 42, subsection 1 of the Media Act enables the Media Authority to allocate
regiona l or local broadcasting time to a regional or local broadcasting organisation, at
the request of the organisation concerned. Section 42, subsection 4 of the Media Act
further states that regional and local broadcasting time is always allocated for a period
of at least five years. This means that only one regional or local broadcasting
organisation can acquire the right to broadcast programmes for a period of at least five
years in each province or municipality. In contrast, the Media Authority determines
the exact amount of broadcasting time on an annual basis, as well as the days, times
and television channels on which the organisations that have been allocated regional
and local broadcasting time can broadcast their programmes. The Media Authority
also uses these powers in relation to Omrop Fryslân.

9.20

Section 43, subsection 1 of the Media Act stipulates that the allocation of
broadcasting time only takes place after the relevant province or municipality has
informed the Media Authority whether the broadcasting organisation in question
meets the requirements laid down by the Media Act. As a rule, this information is
provided once every five years. The provincial authority of Fryslân most recently
provided such information to the Media Authority in a letter dated 22 January 1999.

Government Gazette 2001, 250, p. 123.
Article 52l, paragraph 1 of the Media Decree provides that at least 40 per cent of a private broadcasting
organisation’s television programmes must consist of original programming in Dutch or Frisian.

9.21

In principle, on the recommendation of the provincial authority of Fryslân, the Media
Authority always allocates the broadcasting time of Omrop Fryslân, in its capacity as
a regional public broadcasting organisation, for a period of five years, in accordance
with the statutory provisions mentioned in sections 9.18 and 9.19. In 1999, agreement
was reached regarding an increase in the number of hours of broadcasting time
allocated to public regional broadcasting. At the time of the reference date of this
report, Omrop Fryslân was broadcasting 18 hours of radio programmes per day on
weekdays and 14 hours of radio programmes per day at weekends. This amounts to
118 hours of radio programmes per week. In addition, Omrop Fryslân broadcast a
daily television programme between 18.55 and 20.00. 309 The remaining 18 hours
consisted of text-based television programming. Omrop Fryslân also provided a
teletext service on its television channel. 310

9.22

The Media Act also regulates the funding of regional broadcasting. Section 43,
subsection 3 of the Media Act provides that regional broadcasting organisations are
only allocated broadcasting time if the relevant provincial authorities declare their
willingness to be responsible for funding them. Section 107 of the Media Act further
provides that regional broadcasting organisations that have been allocated
broadcasting time shall receive a reimbursement from the province that is equal to the
sum of all expenses directly related to their broadcasting activities, in so far as these
expenses have been approved by the provincial authority and are not covered by other
means. 311 In the aforementioned letter of 22 January 1999, the province of Fryslân
declared its willingness to be responsible for funding Omrop Fryslân. The resources
that the province of Fryslân makes available to Omrop Fryslân, in its capacity as a
regional broadcasting organisation, are derived partly from central government (see
section 9.23) and partly from the province’s own resources (see sections 9.24 and
9.25).

9.23

At the beginning of 2000, the manner in which regional broadcasting is funded in the
Netherlands was structurally modified (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1999, 573). The
television licence fee was abolished and will in future be levied via income tax. This
fiscalisation of the television licence fee has made it impossible to levy the former
provincial regional broadcasting supplement. A transitional regime by which the
province of Fryslân received financial resources from central government, namely, a
grant from the Provinces Fund as well as a grant from the Media Authority’s general
broadcasting resources, applied between 2000 and 2002. 312
Central government funds Omrop Fryslân in the same manner that it funds other

additional funding or subsidies in view of the fact that Frisian is the second national

As of 1 March 2002, Omrop Fryslân brought the beginning of its daily television broadcast forward by one hour.
Omrop Fryslân currently broadcasts between 17.55 and 19.00, after which the broadcast, excluding the children’s
programme, is repeated between 19.00 and 24.00 and at 9.00 the following morning.
Section 42, subsection 9 of the Media Act facilitates the broadcast of teletext programmes by regional and local
public broadcasting organisations.
These provisions from the Media Act apply only to regional public broadcasting (and not to local public
broadcasting).
Central government provides grants to Omrop Fryslân for both radio and television. In 2000, 2001 and 2002,
central government grants for television were worth €1,860,449, €1,986,264 and €2,035,920 respectively. During
the same period, central government grants for radio were worth €1,539,599, €1,653,118 and €1,694,446
respectively.

language, as agreed in the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (cf.
section 9.13). A transitional regime in which funding is provided jointly by central
government (through the Media Authority) and the province of Fryslân will also apply
in 2003.
9.24

As mentioned in section 9.22, the province of Fryslân can also make funds available
to Omrop Fryslân from its own resources, in addition to above-mentioned grants
made available by central government through the Provinces Fund and the Media
Authority. On 19 December 2001, the provincial council of Fryslân decided to award
Omrop Fryslân the sum of €771,000 in 2001 and the sum of €907,000 in each of the
two following years, in addition to the regular funding provided by the Provinces
Fund. 313 This additional funding is intended to encourage the development of an
integrated and varied broadcasting organisation that uses its resources to develop
Frisian- language television drama, improve the existing range and quality of
television programmes, broadcast major events and programmes on location, and
improve radio programmes. The latter requires the sum of €22,689. Omrop Fryslân
had previously submitted a detailed plan to the province of Fryslân, at the end of
1999, requesting the additional sum of €3.18 million to improve the range and quality
of its programming. 314

9.25

Until 2002, the Media Authority matched every contribution of the province of
Fryslân to Omrop Fryslân’s television production costs. On introducing the matching
principle, central government noted that it wished to apply the mechanism during the
1997-2001 period. 315 In a letter dated 17 August 2001 to the Association of Provincial
Authorities, the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science noted that the
principle would no longer be applied as of 2002. This means that the additional
funding approved by the province of Fryslân for Omrop Fryslân will no longer be
complemented by a similar grant from the Media Authority’s matching fund.

9.26

The province of Fryslân numbers eighteen local public broadcasting organisations,
which operate in 23 municipalities and mainly broadcast radio programmes. Where
television programmes are concerned, such as those of the Mercurius Broadcasting
Association for the inhabitants of Leeuwarden, broadcasts take up no more than one
hour per week.

9.27

A study by the Fryske Akademy from 1998 indicates that most of the broadcasts of
the local broadcasting organisations in the province of Fryslân are conducted in
Dutch. The sixteen broadcasting organisations that participated in the study conducted
2.5 times more broadcasts in Dutch than in Frisian. Only one of the organisations

See also the memorandum of the provincial executive of Fryslân, Finansjele Ympuls Omrop Fryslân, of 8
October 2001, 11-15. The memorandum contributes to the implementation of the media provisions in the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001).
Omrop Fryslân has also requested an additional grant to strengthen the organisation’s internet-related activities.
In addition to providing information on Omrop Fryslân’s programmes, the organisation’s website, at
www.omropfryslan.nl, contains the only Frisian-language newsletter on the internet.
On introducing the matching mechanism, central government announced that it would operate for a five-year
period (1997-2001) to encourage the launch of regional television in all twelve Dutch provinces. Prior to this,
Omrop Fryslân launched its regional television broadcasts as a three-year television experiment on the basis of
the Media Act in February 1994 (cf. Auke S. van der Goot, European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages. Report on the measures adopted by the Netherlands in respect of the Frisian language and culture,
Fryske Akademy, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, The Hague 1999, section 7.6).

appeared to have a language policy. In practice, two of the local broadcasting
organisations broadcast only in Dutch, while one broadcast only in Frisian. 316
9.28

In 1996, AFUK organised two Frisian language courses for employees of local
broadcasting organisations in Fryslân. 317 No such courses have been organised since.

Article 11(1)(b)(ii): commercial broadcasting (radio)
Article 11(1)(c)(ii): commercial broadcasting (television)

9.29

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, for the users of the
Frisian language in the province of Fryslân, ‘to the extent that the public authorities,
directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role in this field, and
respecting the principle of the independence and autonomy of the media:
(b)(ii) to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio programmes in the
[Frisian language] on a regular basis;
(c)(ii) to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of television programmes in the
[Frisian language] on a regular basis.’
In the light of this undertaking, the Netherlands has adopted a number of statutory
regulations on television programmes produced by commercial broadcasting
organisations.

9.30

According to section 110 of the Explanatory Report, subparagraphs (b) and (c) of
Article 11(1) of the European Charter apply to the private sector.

9.31

With regard to commercial broadcasting, the Committee of Experts notes that there is
no special policy to promote Frisian- language programmes in the Netherlands, since
the Media Act only requires that at least 40 per cent of programmes are conducted in
either Dutch or Frisian. In addition, the Committee has received no information
indicating that there are commercial radio or television broadcasts in Frisia n. As the
Committee is not aware of any specific measures that have been taken to encourage
and/or facilitate the broadcasting of such radio and/or television programmes, it
considers that the relevant undertakings are not being fulfilled. 318
In its response to the conclusions of the Committee of Experts, the Dutch government
notes that it has deliberately opted to refrain from placing further requirements on
commercial broadcasting organisations, other than the above- mentioned requirement
that 40 per cent of their programmes are conducted in either Dutch or Frisian. In this
regard, the government further notes that it most definitely considers the abovementioned requirement part of its efforts to encourage and/or facilitate the
broadcasting of radio and television programmes in Frisian, in accordance with the
relevant undertaking under the Charter. The Dutch government therefore challenges
the observation that the Netherlands has not complied with this particular
undertaking. 319

9.32

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on
the encouragement of the use of Frisian in radio and television programmes. Even so,
there are commercial organisations in Fryslân that broadcast radio and/or television
programmes. 320

9.33

Section 71g, subsection 3 of the Media Act provides that the percentage of a private
broadcasting organisation’s television programmes that must consist of original
programming in Dutch or Frisian is determined by order in council. 321 In special
cases, if requested to do so, the Media Authority can lower the required percentage for
a particular commercial broadcasting organisation, on certain conditions. 322

9.34

A provision stipulating that the above- mentioned percentage should be set no lower
than 40 per cent was incorporated in article 52l of the Media Decree by Royal Decree
of 22 June 1992 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 334). Since the ban on non-national
commercial broadcasting was lifted in 1996, this provision applies not only to
national commercial broadcasting but also to regional or local commercial
broadcasting.

9.35

Where original programming in Dutch or Frisian, as referred to in article 52l,
paragraph 1 of the Media Decree, is concerned, various articles of the Policy Rules on
Programme Quotas adopted by the Media Authority (Government Gazette 2001, 250,
p. 123) also apply to commercial broadcasting. Article 6 of these rules defines
original programming in Dutch or Frisian (see section 9.16). Article 8 explains how
the percentage of original programming in Dutch or Frisian should be calculated (see
section 9.17). Article 10 provides that the nature of the channel must be taken into
account when ascertaining the existence of special cases, as referred to in section 71g,
subsection 3 of the Media Act. If a private broadcasting organisation can satisfactorily
demonstrate that it forms such a special case, the required percentage of original
programming in Dutch or Frisian may be lowered for a period of three years.

Article 11(1)(f)(ii): measures encouraging audiovisual productions

9.36

320

321
322

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, for the users of the
Frisian language in the province of Fryslân, ‘to the extent that the public authorities,
directly or indirectly, are competent, have power or play a role in this field, and
respecting the principle of the independence and autonomy of the media:
(f)(ii) to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual
productions in the [Frisian language].’

When granting permission for the broadcast of a commercial radio or television programme, the Media Authority
determines the name of the broadcasting organisation, but not its area of operation. In theory, therefore, a
commercial broadcasting organisation can broadcast a programme that it has received permission to broadcast
throughout the Netherlands. On the basis of the location of their registered offices, it appears that three
commercial broadcasting organisations are located in the province of Fryslân: Waterstad Radio (Sneek), Gerstel
Produkties B.V. (Harlingen) and the Caroline Support Group Netherlands Foundation (also in Harlingen).
Waterstad Radio produces a radio programme entitled ‘Waterstad FM’, Gerstel produces a television programme
entitled ‘GP-TV’ and the Caroline Support Group Netherlands Foundation has received permission to broadcast a
commercial radio programme for general broadcasting purposes. On 21 May 2002, the Media Authority also
granted permission to the commercial broadcasting organisation Update B.V. to broadcas t a radio programme
entitled ‘Freez FM’. This programme is also broadcast in Fryslân via the airwaves.
This is regulated in article 52l of the Media Decree (see section 9.34).
This is regulated in article 10 of the Policy Rules on Programme Quotas of the Media Authority (see section
9.35).

115

9.37

In its report, the Committee of Experts notes the existence of a Dutch Cultural
Broadcasting Promotion Fund. It further notes that, as regional broadcasting
organisations could not apply to this fund in the past, Omrop Fryslân could only
submit funding applications for productions that were intended for national public
television and not for programmes that were intended for broadcast on the regional
television channel. The Committee considers that the Netherlands has formally
fulfilled its undertaking under the Charter, but that it was still difficult for Omrop
Fryslân to obtain funding from the Fund for Frisian- language productions. The
Committee therefore encourages the Dutch government to take special measures in
order to facilitate the practical implementation of this undertaking. 323

9.38

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that Omrop Fryslân’s programmes will qualify for
support from sources such as the Dutch Cultural Broadcasting Promotion Fund. This
has been laid down in the constitution of the Fund (Covenant 5.2). The parties also
agreed that central government will strive to ensure that Frisian- language television
drama productions will also qualify for grants from the Fund (Covenant 5.3).

9.39

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that the
boards of bodies established under the Media Act and the boards of funds focusing on
broadcasting productions include a member with a good knowledge of the Frisian
language and culture. Where necessary, the boards will be able to call in external
expertise in relation to the Frisian language (Covenant 5.4).

9.40

The Dutch Cultural Broadcasting Promotion Fund provides financial assistance in
support of the development and production of programmes of a special Dutch cultural
nature by broadcasting associations, the Netherlands Programme Foundation, the
educational broadcasting organisation, religious or spiritual organisations that have
been allocated broadcasting time at national level and/or on the Dutch world service,
or by two or more of them in cooperation. As noted in section 9.2, regional public
broadcasting organisations can also apply for financial assistance from the Fund as of
1 September 2000.

9.41

Between 1998 and 2001, by its own account, the above Promotion Fund awarded
development grants worth €81,223 to five projects that were all related to the national
broadcasts of Omrop Fryslân. In addition, the Fund awarded Omrop Fryslân a grant
worth €300,853 to produce five documentaries and an operatic adaptation entitled
‘Orfeo Aqua’, which were all broadcast on Netherlands 1.

9.42

As of 2001, the amendment of the Media Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2000, 138)
has enabled the Dutch Cultural Broadcasting Promotion Fund to provide financial
assistance in support of the development and production of programmes of a special
Dutch cultural nature by organisations that have been allocated regional broadcasting

323

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 92, 93. The Netherlands has since amended the Media
Act so that applications for grants may also be submitted in respect of productions intended for regional public
channels (cf. sections 9.2 and 9.42).

116

time. 324 The regional public broadcasting organisations thereby gained access to the
Fund, but – according the Fund’s 2001 annual report – they simultaneously
encountered two problems:
They were required to provide a reasonable financial contribution of their own
for each subsidised programme (at least NLG 10,000 / €4,538 per hour of
television or NLG 500 / €227 per hour of radio).
They could only apply for funding for cultural programmes, which they had
little experience making. According to the Fund’s annual report, this was due to
the fact that, in recent years, they had built up experience mainly in the
production – with limited financial resources and much creativity – of news
programmes (Annual Report, p. 5).
In fact, the two ‘problems’ outlined above are a direct result of the Fund’s goal and
rules. The fact is that the Fund aims to promote cultural programming, and all
broadcasting organisations that apply to it – including regional broadcasting
organisations – are required to provide a reasonable financial contribution of their
own.
9.43

In 2001, which was the first full year for applications from regional public
broadcasting organisations, the Promotion Fund earmarked the sum of NLG 1 million
(€453,780) for this purpose. Due to the above- mentioned problems, not all the money
was distributed. According to the Fund’s 2001 annual report, however, there was a
discernible improvement in the number and quality of applications (Annual Report,
p. 6). Regional broadcasting organisations submitted 24 applications, including two
from Omrop Fryslân. In total, the Fund approved fourteen applications, accounting for
over 80 per cent of its regional broadcasting budget. The Fund rejected both
applications by Omrop Fryslân for financial assistance in support of productions for
the regional channel, because it felt that the applications did not comply with the
relevant requirements. The specific grounds for rejection of Omrop Fryslân’s
applications appear in the annual report (Annual Report, pp. 109-110).

9.44

The amendment of the Media Act and the constitution of the Dutch Cultural
Broadcasting Promotion Fund means that the Netherlands has complied with the
recommendation of the Committee of Experts to make existing financial assistance
measures accessible to radio and/or television programmes in Frisian.

9.45

The province of Fryslân has similar regulations for facilitating cultural media
productions (Provincial Bulletin 1998, 4) that promote the realisation of professional
Frisian- language films, videos, radio and television programmes and other related
productions. 325

Article 11(2): Frisian-language media communications from neighbouring countries

9.46

324

325

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to guarantee freedom
of direct reception of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a
language used in identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and not to

As a result of this amendment of the Media Act, the constitution of the Dutch Cultural Broadcasting Promotion
Fund was adjusted accordingly on 20 December 2000.
In 2000 and 2001, on the basis of a provincial regulation, Omrop Fryslân received a grant worth NLG 300,000
(€136,134) to produce a multilingual drama series entitled ‘Baas boppe baas’. The series was broadcast in 2002.

117

oppose the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring
countries in such a language’.
In view of the freedom of expression that applies in the Netherlands, the latter does not
disrupt or block by other means radio and television broadcasts from other countries. In
this sense, the Netherlands ensures the direct reception of radio and television
broadcasts from neighbouring countries. In practice, however, the Frisian- language
programmes of Welle Nord, RSH and Westküste open channel cannot be received in
the Dutch province of Fryslân due to their limited broadcasting range. The programmes
concerned are also not retransmitted in the Netherlands.
9.47

In the light of EU regulations concerning transfrontier television and the obligations it
imposes on the Netherlands, the Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands
has fulfilled the above-mentioned undertaking. 326

9.48

As Dutch legislation and policy in this area are in accordance with the undertaking
entered into under the European Charter, the Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) contains no agreements in this regard.

9.49

In Germany, various forms of Frisian are spoken in Lower Saxony in the municipality
of Saterland (district of Cloppenburg) and in Schleswig-Holstein in the district of North
Friesland and on Helgoland (see also sections 3.6.3 and 12.9 to 12.14). North Frisian,
which comprises two dialect groups and nine dialects, is spoken by approximately
8,000 people, while Sater Frisian is spoken by approximately 2,250 people. 327

9.50

The media in Germany make limited use of North Frisian. Since 1989, Frisian has
occupied a very minor position in the radio programmes of public broadcasting
organisations. Once a week, NDR (Welle Nord) broadcasts a one-hour evening
programme on Schleswig-Holstein of which three minutes are broadcast in North
Frisian (‘Freesk for enarken’) in the district of North Friesland. In addition, NDR also
broadcasts occasional programmes on Frisian, such as a programme on 1 December
1999 entitled ‘A nuardfresken eran an üüb sia’. A private broadcaster known as RSH
occasionally broadcasts programmes in North Frisian that can be received at the
subregional level on the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein and in the area of Flensburg
and Schleswig. Finally, since 4 October 1999, Radio Friislon broadcasts a programme
on Westküste open channel on the first Monday of every month. The programme,
which is repeated on the third Monday of every month, is produced by the Nordfriisk
Institute in Bredstedt, in cooperation with the Ferian för en nuurdfresk radioo. 328 North
Frisian occupies a marginal position in the printed media: a few daily newspapers in the
district of North Friesland publish a monthly page in North Frisian. 329

9.51

The media in Germany make even less use of Sater Frisian. In Lower Saxony, NDR
occasionally broadcasts reports on Sater Frisian, when there is a topical reason for
doing so, but it does not broadcast them in Sater Frisian. 330

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands also undertook ‘to ensure that no
restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and free circulation of
information in the written press in a language used in identical or similar form to a
regional or minority language’. In view of the freedom of expression tha t applies in the
Netherlands, this right is guaranteed.

9.53

The exercise of the freedoms referred to in Article 11(2) of the European Charter may
be subject to a number of clearly defined and legally prescribed formalities, conditions,
restrictions or penalties. However, this is not relevant in the Dutch context.

9.54

In summary, it is clear that Dutch legislation is in accordance with the provisions of
Article 11 of the European Charter accepted by the Netherlands. The attention of the
Dutch government, in cooperation with the provincial authority of Fryslân, is focused
on the implementation of the relevant measures and the requisite financial and other
preconditions.

Article 12: Cultural activities and facilities

10.1

Article 12(1) of the European Charter provides a non-exhaustive summary of cultural
activities and facilities, especially libraries, video libraries, cultural centres, museums,
archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as well as literary work and film
production, vernacular forms of cultural expression, festivals and the culture
industries, including the use of new technologies. Foreign cultural policy falls within
the scope of Article 12(3) of the European Charter.

10.2

The foundations of Dutch cultural policy can be found in national and provincial
policy documents. Once every four years, the minister with responsibility for cultural
policy draws up a cultural policy document and presents it to parliament. In addition,
the provinces in the Netherlands traditionally possess a large degree of autonomy in
relation to culture. In comparison to other provinces, the province of Fryslân makes
an above average effort in the field of cultural policy. 331

10.3

The Committee of Experts considers that the undertakings entered into by the
Netherlands under Article 12 of the European Charter are being fulfilled, with the
exception of Article 12(1)(e). 332 This issue is discussed in greater detail in sections
10.76 to 10.80.

10.4

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains 32 agreements
describing the efforts that central government and/or the province of Fryslân will
make in respect of key cultural facilities (the Tryater theatre company, the Frisian
Literary Museum and Documentation Centre, the Fryske Akademy and the Provincial
and Buma Library) and various other cultural facilities, such as those for Frisian
writers, films, literary and cultural events outside the Netherlands and youth theatre.
The Covenant contains no agreements concerning Article 12(1)(e) of the Charter.

10.5

Once every four years, the minister with responsibility for cultural policy draws up a
cultural policy document and presents it to parliament. Chapter 5 of the cultural policy
document for 1997-2000, which was issued in 1996, emphasises that Frisian is the
second official national language, in addition to Dutch, and does so in a passage
drawn up in Frisian. 333
Njonken it Nederlânsk is it Frysk ús oare offisjele rykstaal. Ut soarte is
it net sa, dat it feit, dat wy noed steane fan it Nederlânsk en ús soargen
meitsje om de posysje fan dy taal, ûnderstek docht oan it krewearjen
fan it kabinet foar de Fryske taal en kultuer en foar it brûken fan it
Frysk yn it bestjoerlik en yn oar iepenbier ferkear yn Fryslân.334

The policy document further states that ‘care will be taken to ensure that the boards
and advisory committees of the Literary Fund and the Netherlands Literary
Production and Translation Fund include a member with a good knowledge of the
Frisian language and culture. The funding of the Oerol festival and the Frisian
Literary Museum and Documentation Centre, as well as the increased funding of
Tryater theatre company, are also evidence of the government’s commitment to
Frisian culture.’
10.6

The cultural policy document for 2001-2004 lists the Frisian- language Tryater theatre
company as one of the larger companies in the field of the performing arts that is
eligible for an increase in funding. 335 In addition, central government is providing an
annual grant of €130,000 to the Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre
during this period. Section 14.2.4 (Literature and libraries) of the 2002 budget of the
Ministry of Education, Culture & Science deals with government policy on Frisian
literature, among other issues. 336 The cultural policy document also formulates the
key objectives of Dutch foreign cultural policy (see sections 10.103 to 10.108).

10.7

In a letter dated 7 February 2000 to the House of Representatives, the State Secretary
for Education, Culture and Science introduced a policy framework for regional
historical centres. 337 These centres are created through the integration of heritage
organisations that manage archives and other historical sources. 338 A sum of €2.4
million has been made available in support of the State Secretary’s proposals, which
involve the Provincial and Buma Library of Fryslân (see sections 10.40 to 10.43), the
state archives in Fryslân and the Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre
(see sections 10.22 to 10.27).

10.8

The provincial executive of Fryslân has provided an outline of the province’s cultural
policies in a memorandum on cultural policy, entitled Kultuer yn Fryslân 20.01\04.
This memorandum identifies the province of Fryslân’s primary responsibility for the

The cultural policy document for 1997-2000 was sent to the House of Representatives of the States General by
letter of 17 September 1996: see Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 1996-1997, 25 013, no. 1.
‘In addition to Dutch, Frisian is our second official national language. Needless to say, the fact that we are
responsible for the Dutch language and concerned about its status does not prejudice the government’s efforts
with regard to the Frisian language and culture and the use of Frisian in administrative and other public matters in
Fryslân.’
The cultural policy document for 2001-2004 was sent to the House of Representatives of the States General by

development of the Frisian language as the third determining factor with regard to
culture in Fryslân. 339 In the memorandum, the provincial executive of Fryslân
describes the preservation, display and disclosure of the Fryslân collection as its first
goal, and the promotion of the artistic expressions of the Frisian population, both
professional and amateur, as its second goal.
In this context, it is important to note that the province organises a major Frisian
festival once every five years. During the past reporting period, it was held in 2000, in
combination with the Simmer 2000 event (cf. sections 10.71 to 10.73). The
memorandum does not discuss the province of Fryslân’s foreign ambitions with
regard to Frisian language and culture. In this area, a policy document on international
contacts in the field of bilingualism dating from 1987 still serves as the main
guideline.
10.9

With regard to the specific elements of its cultural policy, the province’s
memorandum on cultural policy formulates the following goals:
performing arts:
•
structural funding of support and umbrella organisations in the field of theatre
and pop music;
•
structural funding of the Tryater and De Citadel youth theatre companies;
literature:
•
more quality, more readers and assistance for young people;
•
integrating Frisian literature in the media;
•
strengthening the cultural profile of Fryslân on the Dutch literary scene and
increasing the value of literary prizes;
libraries:
•
strengthening an integrated library network;
•
establishing contacts between libraries, the education sector, the welfare
sector, archives and ICT companies;
archives:
•
developing a regional historical centre;
•
encouraging cooperation between archives, libraries and cultural facilities;
media:
•
strengthening regional broadcasting programmes in the new media;
•
strengthening Frisian-language television drama; 340 and
cultural education:
•
support of the ‘culture and school’ project;

‘within the territory in which [the Frisian language is] used and to the extent that the
public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
a
to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to [the Frisian
language] and foster the different means of access to works produced in [this
language];
b
to foster the different means of access in other languages to works produced in
[the Frisian language] by aiding and developing translation, dubbing, postsynchronisation and subtitling activities;
d
to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting cultural
activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for incorporating the
knowledge and use of [the Frisian language] in the undertakings which they
initiate or for which they provide backing.’
10.11 The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is fulfilling the abovementioned undertakings. 342
10.12 The discussion in this report of national and provincial policies on activities and
facilities in the field of Frisian culture will focus successively on policies and policy
agreements in the following areas:

Other activities and projects (sections 10.68 to 10.75).

Frisian-language theatre (Tryater)
10.13 Central government subsidises a professional Frisian- language theatre company. This
company, which is known as Tryater, puts on productions in Frisian for adults and
bilingual productions for children and young people. The maintenance of bilingual
youth theatre is partly made possible by funding from the province of Fryslân. These
matters are regulated in the Cove nant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001)
(Covenant 6.1.1 and 6.6.11).
10.14 The maintenance of Tryater will be assessed in the light of the basic premises set out
in the government cultural policy document. The central government assessment will
be conducted by the Council for Culture (Covenant 6.1.2). In the framework of the
Covenant, central government and the province of Fryslân agreed that central
government will provide financial support to Tryater in accordance with the relevant
norms, on the understanding that as far as the geographic distribution of performances
is concerned, it will normally suffice to put on performances within the province of
Fryslân, with only occasional performances outside the province (Covenant 6.1.3).

10.15 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that the province will create the conditions necessary
to ensure a proper distribution of performances across the province by subsidising
performances which would otherwise not be possible because of the limited capacity
or location of the venue (Covenant 6.1.4).
10.16 Central government and the province of Fryslân consider it their duty, also in the light
of the European Charter, to maintain a professional Frisian-language theatre company
such as Tryater. If, on the basis of the assessment referred to in section 10.14, a
decision is made to reduce or terminate funding to the company, or if the company
ceases its activities, the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the provincial
executive of Fryslân will discuss the situation as it then stands (Covenant 6.1.5).
10.17 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that the province will work with stakeholders in the
Frisian theatre world to ensure that, having regard to the advisory role of the national
Council for Culture, the quality of Frisian- language youth theatre is high enough by
2010 for it to be integrated into the national theatre system (Covenant 6.6.11).
10.18 The financial support and assessment of Tryater is carried out in accordance with the
norms applying to professional theatre, on the understanding that there will be one
exception to these norms. 343 As far as the geographic distribution of performances is
concerned, it will normally suffice to put on performances within the province of
Fryslân, although the Minister of Education, Culture and Science continues to attach
importance to performance outside the province. This observation applies in particular
to performances in the field of youth theatre and education.
10.19 In order to ensure a good geographic distribution of performances in the field of the
performing arts in the province of Fryslân, the latter has adopted a regulation on
theatre and music and a regulation on performing arts (see annexe 1.2 and Covenant
6.1.4). As it happens, Tryater does not limit its performances to the province of
Fryslân.
10.20 Provisional figures for 2001 indicate that 178 out of a total of 440 theatre
performances for adults, children and young people were put on outside the province
of Fryslân, including 37 in Groningen, 38 in Drenthe and 101 in North Brabant. In
2000, 160 out of a total of 704 theatre performances were put on outside the province,
including 30 in Groningen, 58 in Drenthe and 62 in North Brabant. 344 In 1999, finally,
121 out of a total of 404 theatre performances were put on outside the province,
including 33 performances in Groningen, 45 in Drenthe and 39 in the rest of the
Netherlands. Four performances have been put on outside the Netherlands: three in
Belgium and one in London (see also section 12.26). 345
10.21 The plays performed by Tryater consist of translations and Frisian-language
adaptations of plays from around the world, as well as original plays in the Frisian
343

A second exception to the norms applying to national professional theatre, concerning the required minimum
level of self-generated income, applied to Tryater until the beginning of 2001.

language. The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture contains an agreement
on the writing of original plays in Frisian (cf. section 10.67).
Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre
10.22 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that there will be an institute for the documentation,
archiving and promotion of Frisian language and literature in Fryslân, maintained by
the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the province of Fryslân. These
tasks are currently being performed by the Frisian Literary Museum and
Documentation Centre in Leeuwarden (Covenant 6.2.1). The Centre will be assessed
in the light of the basic premises set out in the government cultural policy document
and of provincial policy on literature. The central government assessment will be
conducted by the Council for Culture (Covenant 6.2.2).
10.23 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that financial support will be provided to the
Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre in accordance with the relevant
national norms. The Centre may enter into joint ventures with similar institutes
outside Fryslân in order to achieve a wider dissemination of information (Covenant
6.2.3). Central government and the province of Fryslân consider it their duty, also in
the light of the European Charter, to maintain an institute such as the Centre in some
form or other. If, on the basis of the assessment referred to in section 10.22, a decision
is made to reduce or terminate funding to the Centre, or if the Centre ceases its
activities, the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the provincial executive
of Fryslân will discuss the situation as it then stands (Covenant 6.2.4).
10.24 Documentation and archiving form an important part of the Centre’s work, in addition
to organising exhibitions, publications and lectures.
10.25 Since 1991, at the request of the provincial executive of Fryslân, the Centre has
played a part in fostering the literary climate in the province, and appointed a
coordinator for this purpose. In the framework of this task, the Centre is also
responsible for providing guidance to Frisian authors, and it therefore regularly
organises courses and workshops for writers of Frisian- language literature.
10.26 The above- mentioned coordinator is also responsible for organising performances by
Frisian authors outside the province of Fryslân and the Netherlands (see sections
10.49, 10.110 and 10.111).
10.27 The Provincial and Buma Library, the Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation
Centre and the state archives in Fryslân are examining the possibility of establishing a
joint regional historico-cultural and literary centre. 346 In the process, they are
elaborating the policy framework of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science
for the establishment of regional historical centres, as referred to in sectio n 10.7. On
the basis of a study conducted in 2000, the competent authorities of the three

346

The municipal archives in Leeuwarden are also involved in the merger, but will join the new institute formed by
the merger of the three above-mentioned organisations at a later date.

124

organisations aim to merge the organisations during the course of 2002. 347 The parties
have agreed that the bilingual nature of the new organisation is a sine qua non that
will be laid down by law (see also section 10.43). 348
Study of and research into the Frisian language and culture: the Fryske Akademy
10.28 At the university level, academic research into Frisian language and literature takes
place at the University of Groningen, the University of Amsterdam and the University
of Leiden (see also sections 6.115, 6.120 to 6.126 and section 10.39).
10.29 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that there will be an institute for the study of and
research into the Frisian language and culture, maintained by the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science and the province of Fryslân. At the time the Covenant
was entered into, that institute was the Fryske Akademy (Covenant 6.3.1).
10.30 In accordance with existing research policies concerning para- university institutions
such as the Fryske Akademy, the financial resources available to the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science in support of the Fryske Akademy have been
transferred to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW). In this
regard, the following provisions from section 6.3.2 of the Covenant apply:
a
the nature of the relationship between the Fryske Akademy and the KNAW
will be determined jointly by them. The former will remain a separate,
independent entity and will retain its status as a non-profit foundation;
b
the central government funds transferred to the KNAW will be earmarked for
research into aspects of the Frisian language and culture by the [Fryske
Akademy];
c
the KNAW will assess the quality of the research conducted by the [Fryske
Akademy], including the efficiency of its research programming both in
relation to activities in this discipline elsewhere and otherwise (Covenant
6.3.2).
10.31 Central government and the province of Fryslân consider it their duty, also in the light
of the European Charter, to maintain an institution such as the Fryske Akademy. The
parties therefore concluded the following agreements in the framework of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001). If, on the basis of its
assessment as referred to in the preceding paragraph under (c), the KNAW is of the
opinion that substantial changes should be made in the allocation of funds to the
Fryske Akademy, it will immediately inform the Minister of Education, Culture and
Science of its views. Moreover, if the province of Fryslân is considering reducing its
funding of the Fryske Akademy, it must immediately inform the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science of its views. In both cases, before a decision is taken
on the matter, the KNAW or the provincial executive of Fryslân will hold talks with
the Minister of Education, Culture and Science to discuss other ways of achieving the
objectives (Covenant 6.3.3 and 6.3.4).

Conclusions of the steering committee on the cooperation between the Provincial Library, the state archives in
Fryslân, the Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre and the municipal archives in Leeuwarden,
adopted on 10 January 2001.

125

10.32 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the code of conduct contained in the
agreement between the Fryske Akademy and the KNAW forms part of the new
Covenant (Covenant 6.3.5).
10.33 In order to perform its duties, the Fryske Akademy receives annual subsidies from the
KNAW and the provincial executive of Fryslân. The academic activities of the Fryske
Akademy are divided between three departments:
•
the department of linguistics
•
the department of history, literature and onomastics, and
•
the department of social sciences.
10.34 The department of linguistics focuses in particular on lexicography and grammatical
research. In addition, it is worth mentioning the department’s activities in the field of
dialectological research. A number of projects that the department worked on during
the 1999-2001 reporting period are discussed below.
The first project worth noting concerns the Dictionary of the Frisian Language, which
was started after the founding of the Fryske Akademy in 1938 and made its first
appearance in 1984. So far, eighteen of the 25 planned volumes of the dictionary have
been published. The project involves the scholarly description of the vocabulary of
“New Frisian” from the 1800-1975 period. A concise Frisian dictionary, which is
being prepared on the basis of the above- mentioned dictionary, will appear at the end
of 2003. In 2001, finally, the department of linguistics started work on a project to
record the corpus of spoken Frisian.
10.35 In 2000, the Fryske Akademy published a large Frisian-English dictionary that
provides translations of 37,000 Frisian words in British and US English. This
dictionary is intended as a vade mecum and a Frisian- English translation tool, and
includes an English-Frisian glossary.
10.36 The Fryske Akademy also published a Dutch-Frisian legal dictionary in 2000. In
theory, the number of Frisian translations per heading or per meaning within an entry
is limited to one. As the aim of the dictionary is prescriptive, with a view to the use of
Frisian as a legal language, a decision was made not to provide a list of synonyms. On
the basis of this legal dictionary, the department of linguistics has started preparing a
book of Frisian- language models for legal practice, which are of particular importance
for the notarial profession (see section 7.38). It is anticipated that this book of models
will be published in 2005.
10.37 The research of the department of history, literature and onomastics focuses in
particular on Frisian intellectual history, the Frisian nobility in the Middle Ages,
literary attitudes of the nineteenth century, literary reviews and discussions of the
twentieth century Frisian poet Obe Postma, and the mysterious Oera Linda book, 349
which was discovered in 1867. Among other ventures, the department is involved in
349

The Oera Linda book, a mysterious nineteenth-century account of the history of Fryslân, is v ery unusual in form
and content. Written in a kind of runic script, it has been the object of much conjecture regarding its meaning and
origins. See Goffe Jensma, ‘Geen Fries spot met zijn land: Nationalisme, ironie en het Oera Linda-boek’,
Bijdragen en mededelingen betreffende de geschiedenis der Nederlanden 117(3), 2002, 331-343.

126

the publication of the Frisian Classics series, in which previously published Frisian
literary works no longer available outside libraries are reissued (see also section
10.49).
10.38 In addition to its various other activities, the department of social sciences is
conducting research into the current status of Frisian inside and outside Fryslân. One
of its fields of interest is the use of Frisian in education in Fryslân. In 2000, the
department also launched a study of the language(s) of Frisian emigrants. This study
focuses in particular on Frisians that emigrated to the United States, Canada and
Australia and elsewhere during the past century. The department is also conducting
comparative research into policymaking with regard to regional or minority languages
in Europe. In this framework, the department published a study in 2000 on
policymaking with regard to Frisian in the Netherlands and Germany and Sorbian in
Germany. The European, or international, dimension of the study is not only taking
shape through a large number of international contacts, publications and conferences,
but also through the implementation of a European information and documentation
project, known as Mercator Education, which focuses in particular on the status of
regional or minority languages in the education sectors of the EU member states.
10.39 In addition to its research activities, the Fryske Akademy also provides courses on
Frisian language and literature at the University of Amsterdam. In 2000, the future of
the ‘doctoraal’ degree in Frisian came under pressure when the humanities faculty of
the University of Amsterdam suggested swapping the above- mentioned degree with
the humanities faculty of the University of Groningen in exchange for the latter’s
degree in Modern Greek (see sections 6.120 to 6.122).
Provincial and Buma Library of Fryslân
10.40 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that there will be an academic library for the Frisian
language and culture, to be maintained by the province of Fryslân. At the time the
Covenant was entered into, that institute was the Provincial and Buma Library of
Fryslân (Covenant 6.4.1). The Provincial Library is regarded by the Minister of
Education, Culture and Science and the provincial executive of Fryslân as being of
major importance because of its impressive collection geared to the study of Frisian
and the history of the Frisian people. Through the inter- library loan system and other
channels, the Provincial Library meets the needs of scholars and other persons
interested in this field not only in the province but throughout the Netherlands and –
to a limited extent – around the world. The Provincial Library is responsible for
maintaining and expanding this important collection (Covenant 6.4.4).
10.41 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that cooperation between the Provincial Library and
the institutions of higher education in Fryslân will be strengthened (Covenant 6.4.2).
In addition, where necessary, the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the
provincial executive of Fryslân will take further measures to facilitate a genuine
improvement in the quality and position of the Provincial Library within the network
of academic information facilities (Covenant 6.4.3).

127

10.42 Central government and the province of Fryslân consider it their duty, also in the light
of the European Charter, to maintain an institute such as the Provincial and Buma
Library. If the Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the provincial
executive of Fryslân are of the opinion that the objectives relating to the Provincial
Library, as formulated in Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (see
Covenant 6.4.1 to 6.4.4), are not being achieved in a satisfactory manner, the two
parties will hold talks to discuss other ways of achieving these objectives (Covenant
6.4.5).
10.43 At the time of the reference date of this report, the merger of the Provincial Library,
the Frisian Literary Museum and Documentation Centre and the state archives in
Fryslân into a new regional historico-cultural and literary centre was already at an
advanced stage (cf. sections 10.7 and 10.27).
National literary and translation funds
10.44 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that Frisian writers will be able to apply to the national
literary and translation funds, which will take account of the specific market
conditions in which these writers operate and the sales opportunities open to them
(Covenant 6.5.1). This agreement currently applies to the Netherlands Literary
Production and Translation Fund (NLPVF) and the Literary Fund, as well as to the
activities of the national Stichting Lezen. This foundation, which subsidises projects
promoting the enjoyment of reading, focuses on both Dutch and Frisian literature.
10.45 The Literary Fund and the NLPVF are legal persons under private law that may in
fact be classified as autonomous administrative authorities falling under the General
Administrative Law Act. Their constitutions and rules of procedure are published in
the Government Gazette. The minister responsible for cultural policy must approve
the amendment of these constitutions and rules of procedure, as well as the dissolution
of the funds. The funds’ responsibilities in relation to Frisian literature are discussed
in sections 10.46 to 10.51. 350 The board of the NLPVF includes a member with a good
knowledge of Frisian literature (see section 10.84).
10.46 The aim of the NLPVF, whose registered offices are located in Amsterdam, is to
promote the production of high-quality original literary works in Dutch and Frisian,
the translation of such works into other languages and the translation into Dutch or
Frisian of literary works in inaccessible languages, if these works are regarded as
being particularly relevant to literary diversity in the Netherlands.
10.47 The NLPVF awards translation grants to foreign publishing companies that wish to
publish Dutch or Frisian literature, including children’s books, in translation. Dur ing
the period covered by this report, the foundation awarded one grant in 2000 for the
translation of a Frisian- language text into English and Dutch, namely, the booklet of
texts accompanying Tsjêbbe Hettinga’s CD, ‘It doarp: Always ready’, which was
issued in 2000 by the Montaigne publishing company.

350

On the promotion and presentation of Frisian literature outside the Netherlands, see sections 10.109 to 10.111.

128

10.48 In 1999, the NLPVF subsidised the publication of three volumes in the Frisian
Classics series. This series, which reissues highlights of Frisian literature that are no
longer available in bookshops, is the result of the cooperation of three Frisian
publishers, the Fryske Boek foundation and the Fryske Akademy. The eighth volume
in the series was published in 2000, and a further two volumes appeared in 2001. Two
volumes still remain to be published. Between 1999 and 2001, the NLPVF also
subsidised the publication of two Frisian- language literary magazines – Hjir and
Trotwaer – and contributed to the publication of twenty Frisian- language books.
10.49 On the initiative of the NLPVF, a Frisian literature day was organised in Amsterdam
on 18 November 2001 to introduce Frisian literature and authors to a wider public. In
cooperation with the Literary Fund, the Stichting Lezen and the Frisian Literary
Museum and Documentation Centre, various Frisian authors and poets presented a
varied programme at the event. Furthermore, on the occasion of the Frisian literature
day, the NLPVF published a 64-page trilingual (Dutch, Frisian and English) booklet
containing, in addition to a number of author profiles, information on the Frisian
literary enterprise, the Frisian Classics series and Frisian- language literary magazines,
as well as a bibliography of Frisian- language literature that has appeared in translation
in Dutch, English, German and French since 1945. The Frisian literature day mainly
targeted Dutch publishers, other professional stakeholders and members of the public
with an interest in literature.
10.50 The aim of the Literary Fund, whose registered offices are also located in Amsterdam,
is to promote the quality and the diversity of Dutch and Frisian- language literature
and literature translated into Dutch or Frisian. For this purpose, the Fund awards
grants, including travel and maintenance grants, to writers and translators of Frisianlanguage works, if the work of the writer or translator contributes to the quality and
diversity of Dutch and Frisian- language literature, in the opinion of the Fund’s board,
and if all the formal and material requirements referred to in the Fund’s bye- laws have
been met. The board of the Literary Fund is assisted in its decision- making by an
advisory council, which includes a member with a good knowledge of Frisian
literature (see section 10.85).
10.51 By its own account, the Literary Fund earmarked €90,025 in 1999, €94,074 in 2000
and €168,836 in 2001 in support of Frisian- language literature (see annexe 8).
10.52 The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science has earmarked part of its budget for
projects that encourage the reading of Dutch and Frisian- language literature. The
funds in question are managed by the Stichting Lezen, which strives to promote the
enjoyment of reading in Dutch and Frisian. In this regard, the foundation’s priorities
are activities targeting children up to the age of 18. Within this target group, a
distinction is made between children up to the age of 6 (pre-school and early
education: reading to children as an important aspect of modern language policy), 6 to
12-year-olds (primary education: reading by and to pupils as an important and flexible
aspect of language policy) and 12 to 18-year-olds, with a further distinction between
lower forms (basic secondary education and pre-vocational secondary education) and
upper forms (particularly the teaching of literature in senior general secondary
education and pre-university education). Three different approaches are used in
relation to activities within these target groups: special attention for target groups with
a non-Dutch linguistic background, an approach based on the national ‘culture and

129

school’ approach (including the teaching and study of literature) and special attention
for the role of large and small municipalities in promoting projects that encourage
reading.
10.53 In 1999, the Stichting Lezen awarded a grant to an email project (Boekmail)
organised by the Central Library Service for Fryslân, as well as to a collaborative
multimedia project (Tomke) targeting children of pre-school age and their parents and
educators. In 2000, with a view to their implementation, the foundation again awarded
grants to both projects. In 2001, the foundation awarded grants in support of Tomke,
the organisers of the Frisian literature day (cf. section 10.49) and a survey carried out
by AFUK on policy and other initiatives of Frisian municipalities to encourage
reading.
10.54 Since 2001, the Stichting Lezen has operated a scheme to stimulate municipalities to
conduct an active policy to encourage reading, involving a one-off financial incentive
for local multi- year projects in this area. In 2001, the Frisian municipalities did not
make use of this scheme.
National funds and schemes for films
10.55 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will strive to ensure that
financial incentives for the production of Dutch- language films also apply to Frisianlanguage films (Covenant 6.5.2).
10.56 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government has
also formulated two objectives for the period until 2004. First, it will strive to ensure
that Frisian- language films will qualify for grants from the Dutch Film Fund
(Covenant 6.6.5). Second, it will provide incidental grants for film festivals, film
events and investment in film theatres in order to encourage the screening of films of
high cinematic merit at national and regional level. This may also help to encourage
the screening of Frisian-language films (Covenant 6.6.6).
10.57 The Dutch Film Fund, whose registered offices are located in Amsterdam, focuses on
encouraging the production of films in the Netherlands, with an emphasis on quality
and diversity, and on fostering a favourable climate for the Dutch film industry. In
1999, the Fund made NLG 25,000 (€11,2000) available for the development of the
screenplay of the Frisian- language film Nynke, produced by Egmond Film &
Television and directed by Pieter Verhoeff. For the purpose of its completion, the
same film received an additional subsidy of NLG 1 million (€448,000) from the Fund
in 2000.
10.58 The provincial executive of Fryslân wishes to improve the province’s infrastructure
for the production of films. By providing funding for film and media production, the
province of Fryslân wishes to create a favourable climate for writing and producing
Frisian- language feature films and documentaries. The province supports the
production of approximately six screenplays per year from its budget for language and
culture. 351

Other national funds (Performing Arts Fund and the Amateur Arts Fund)
10.59 The Netherlands has a national fund for the performing arts, the Performing Arts
Fund, which provides subsidies for activities in the field of the professional
performing arts. The Fund operates grant schemes for projects, individual artists and
the internationalisation of the performing arts, and also operates a group budgets
scheme for jazz and improvisational music. 352 In addition, at the request of the
Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, the Fund operates the Dutch Music Prize
scheme. In 2001, the Fund undertook to subsidise the performance of a Frisian opera,
entitled Rixt, at the Oerol festival on Terschelling.
10.60 The Amateur Arts Fund aims to contribute to the development and diversity of
amateur arts in the Netherlands. 353 In practice, this means that the Fund generally
subsidises projects that are of wider significance than the interests of the participants
alone. For example, certain projects may serve as a precedent or provide new material
that can be used afterwards by other amateurs. The same applies when the initiators of
a project adopt a new approach: when other artists emulate this approach, it often
contributes to the development of the amateur arts. In 2000, in addition to a number of
subsidies in the field of music and dance in Fryslân, the Amateur Arts Fund
subsidised the Nylsk fan Hermana project, which was performed eight times in
Minnertsga during the summer of that year.
State budget allocation for the Frisian language: other cultural facilities
10.61 Since 1971, the central government cultural budget has contained an allocation for
promoting the Frisian language and culture, which is mentioned in the Covenant on
the Frisian Language and Culture (Covenant 6.6.1). This annual central government
grant for Frisian language and culture is meant to enable the province of Fryslân to
pursue initiatives and activities in this regard. At present, the grant amounts to
€442,894.354
10.62 The province of Fryslân uses the resources available under the allocation for the
Frisian language to subsidise the funding of its language, literature and cultural
policies. For this purpose, the province of Fryslân annually submits an itemised
budget, together with an explanation of its aims, to the Minister of Education, Culture
and Science by 1 December (Covenant 6.6.2). The Covenant contains a nonexhaustive summary of activities that are partly funded through the central
government grant for Frisian language and culture (see sections 10.63 to 10.67).

The Performing Arts Fund also serves as a channel for minor grant applications in the framework of Dutch
foreign cultural policy (see section 10.108). Regarding the difference between large-scale and non-large-scale
projects, see section 10.106, footnotes.
The Amateur Arts Fund also serves as a channel for minor grant applications in the framework of Dutch foreign
cultural policy (see section 10.108). For more information, see the previous note.
In the second progress report on the review of specific allocations, the review committee concluded with regard
to the specific allocation for Frisian language and culture that the division of responsibility and activities and the
distribution of information are in perfect balance. ‘The regulatio n is clear-cut and dovetails to the greatest
possible extent, in this particular case, with the distribution of information and chains of accountability at
provincial level. Among other things, the legislation is now highly tailored to single audits. The committee also
envisages that the four-year period defined in the cultural policy document will be adopted in relation to
planning.’ In the next amendment of the relevant legislation, the committee recommends creating a formal basis,
if possible, for a move towards information regarding accountability that focuses increasingly on outputs and
effects: see Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 1999-2000, 24 036, no. 146, pp. 7, 8 and 32-34.

10.63 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will subsidise provincial
prizes for Frisian literature via the central government grant scheme (Covenant 6.6.8).
10.64 The province of Fryslân further developed the above- mentioned policy proposal in its
memorandum on cultural policy, entitled Kultuer yn Fryslân 20.01\04, in which it
announces the development of a comprehensive policy on Frisian literature prizes,
including an increase in the value of existing prizes and the addition of prizes for
Frisian- language songs and amateur theatre. 355
10.65 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân also agreed that the province will cooperate with publishers
and other parties in the Frisian book industry to increase the sale of Frisian- language
books. This effort will be funded in part out of the above-mentioned central
government grant (Covenant 6.6.3). The Fryske Boek foundation, which is
responsible for promoting and distributing Frisian-language books, will play an
important part in this.
10.66 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the province will cooperate with authors,
publishers and other stakeholders to ensure a substantial increase in the number of
literary debuts by authors under the age of 30. This effort will be funded in part out of
the central government grant for Frisian language and culture (Covenant 6.6.4). This
policy proposal was also included in the provincial memorandum on cultural policy,
which recommends the introduction of an annual grant for aspiring authors as a
contribution towards the cost of editorial assistance. 356
10.67 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân finally agreed that resources from the central government
grant for Frisian language and culture can be used to commission the writing of
original plays in the Frisian language (Covenant 6.6.7).
Other activities and projects
10.68 In 1998, the Council of Europe and the European Commission declared 2001 the
European Year of Languages. Central government consequently established a
National Committee for the European Year of Languages to draw the public’s
attention to the importance of languages, especially during 2001. 357 On 12 December
2000, the provincial executive of Fryslân decided to establish an advisory committee
on the European Year of Languages. It also provided €68,000 (NLG 150,000) for
various activities that were initiated and realised with the help of an additional
government grant of €22,270 (NLG 50,000). Furthermore, the municipality of
Leeuwarden also provided €22,270 towards the commemoration of the fiftieth
anniversary of Kneppelfreed on 16 November 2001 in Leeuwarden. 358

10.69 Other notable elements of the Frisian programme for the European Year of Languages
included the first ever appearance, in addition to the regular edition, of a complete
Frisian- language edition of the Leeuwarder Courant on 12 June 2001. In addition,
Omrop Fryslân produced and broadcast five television programmes on dying
languages in Europe, and a Frisian spelling competition was broadcast live by the
broadcasting organisation. Finally, a Frisian- language poem by Tiny Mulder, entitled
‘Bitterswiet’, was translated and published in 84 languages. The European
Commission provided a subsidy of €12,800 for the publication of the poem, as well as
for the production and publication of a booklet by the Dutch committee of the
European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages containing the 80 most-frequently-asked
questions on multilingualism. 359
10.70 In the framework of the 2001 European Year of Languages, the Council of Europe
and the Dutch Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations organised a European
conference on the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The aim of
the conference, which took place in Noordwijkerhout on 30 November and
1 December 2001, was to inform the member states of the Council of Europe of the
value and significance of the European Charter for the development and
implementation of policies on native or regional minority languages and cultures by
those member states.
10.71 In the summer of 2000 – between 1 and 22 July – two major, interconnected events
with a bearing on the Frisian language took place in the province of Fryslân. These
events were the Frysk Festival, which has been held once every five years since 1980,
and the Simmer 2000 event, in the framework of which all Frisians resident outside
Fryslân were invited to visit Fryslân on the occasion of the beginning of the new
millennium. In the context of the two events, local committees organised all kinds of
local activities in as many as 272 different locations, as well as a number of regional
activities.
10.72 The Frysk Festival included three major projects: an opera entitled ‘Orfeo Aqua’, a
visual arts project entitled ‘Pylgers nei Fryslân’ and the Slachtemarathon, a marathon
for competitive runners and walkers, interspersed with cultural activities. Simmer
2000 included an opening and a closing event, as well as the publication of the
Simmer 2000-krante, which appeared 16 times from 1998 onwards and had 12,000
Frisian subscribers outside Fryslân. According to the organisers of the Frysk Festival,
‘Orfeo Aqua’ attracted 15,000 spectators, the Slachtemarathon attracted 9,450
participants and 100,000 spectators and ‘Pylgers nei Fryslân’ attracted 12,000 visitors.
The various local activities organised in the framework of Simmer 2000 attracted
400,000 people, 200,000 people participated in the regional activities and 60,000
Frisians from outside Fryslân, many of whom from traditional immigration countries
like Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States, were drawn to the various
events. The conclusion of this major event was aptly expressed in the last line of the
official Simmer 2000 song: ‘Fryslân do libbest as in hert’. 360

Kneppelfreed is regarded as a historic turning point in the attitude of central government towards the Frisian
language.

133

10.73 The provincial executive of Fryslân contributed to the realisation of the Frysk Festival
with a grant of NLG 877,000 (€397,900). Central government provided a grant of
NLG 300,000 (€136,100) and sponsors contributed NLG 219,000 (€99,300). In
addition, Simmer 2000 required a provincial subsidy of NLG 340,000 (€154,200),
sponsors and various funds contributed NLG 605,000 (€274,500) and NLG 155,000
(€70,300) respectively and the closing event itself raised NLG 313,000 (€142,000) in
entrance fees.
10.74 The ‘Frysk yn de musea’ project, organised by AFUK’s Frisian La nguage Support
Centre, Stipepunt Frysk, in cooperation with the Federation of Frisian Museums and
Antiquities Rooms, officially concluded in 2000. Fifty of the more than 70 museums
in Fryslân participated in this project to promote the use of Frisian in museums,
particularly in relation to the texts, public relations materials, signposting and
websites used in the museums and their exhibitions.
10.75 The ‘Frysk yn de musea’ project continued in 2001 and 2002, particularly with regard
to the maintenance of Frisian-language texts in the museums. Museums that did not
previously participate in the project were asked to do so. The project also provided
funding to cover production and material costs, thereby seemingly removing an earlier
obstacle to the project’s implementation.
Article 12(1)(e): command of Frisian among staff of cultural organisations

10.76 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, with regard to
cultural activities and facilities – a non-exhaustive list of which appears in Article
12(1) of the Charter:
‘within the territory in which [the Frisian language is] used and to the extent that the
public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
e
to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or
supporting cultural activities have at their disposal staff who have a full
command of [the Frisian language], as well as of the language(s) of the rest of
the population.’
In this context, it is advisable to distinguish between bodies at national and provincial
level.
10.77 The Committee of Experts considers that the above-mentioned undertaking is not
being fulfilled. The Committee notes that it is the policy of the Dutch government to
encourage national cultural organisations to recruit at least one staff member who can
act as a link with the Frisian-speaking community. The Committee further notes that
this policy has little effect in practice. On this basis, the Committee concludes that the
undertaking is not being fulfilled. It therefore encourages the Dutch government to
develop measures addressing this shortcoming. 361
10.78 The Committee of Experts’ observations appear to be based on a misunderstanding.
The aim of Dutch government policy with regard to national cultural bodies, such as
361

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 96.

134

the Netherlands Literary Production and Translation Fund and the Literary Fund, is
not that each fund should have at least one staff member with an active command of
the Frisian language, but that the advisory councils of these funds should include at
least one member with a good knowledge of Frisian language and culture, in this case
Frisian literature, as referred to in Article 12(1)(f) of the Charter. Similar guarantees
regarding a good knowledge of Frisian language and culture also apply to the boards
of bodies established on the basis of the Media Act and the boards of funds focusing
on broadcasting productions (cf. section 9.39). 362
10.79 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements in
fulfilment of the above- mentioned undertaking.
10.80 With regard to provincial cultural bodies, it is generally accepted that some staff
members should have an active command of the Frisian language. A number of social
and cultural organisations in Fryslân that deal with a large number of Frisian-speaking
citizens and agencies have complained to central government about the poor quality
of Frisian as a subject in secondary education. They contend that potential employees
consequently have little or no knowledge of written Frisian and that this shortcoming
presents them with increased costs (extra language courses for staff members) and/or
a reduction in recruitment potential. In the opinion of the organisations, this would not
be the case if the government had implemented the education provisions of the
European Charter more effectively. During the recent reporting period, an exchange
of letters on this issue took place between the Ministry of Education, Culture and
Science and the Lytse Doarpen Association, among other organisations. The Ministry
has expressed its expectation that this problem will be solved in the foreseeable future
as a result of recent measures to improve the position of Frisian in secondary
education, as adopted in the province of Fryslân’s education policy document. 363
Article 12(1)(f): participation by users of Frisian in facilities and activities

10.81 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, with regard to
cultural activities and facilities – a non-exhaustive list of which appears in Article
12(1) of the Charter:
‘within the territory in which [the Frisian language is] used and to the extent that the
public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
f
to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of [the Frisian
language] in providing facilities and planning cultural activities.’
In this context, it is advisable to distinguish between bodies at national and provincial
level.

362

363

It has been determined by the constitution of the Netherlands Literary Production and Translation Fund that its
board should include one member with a good knowledge of Frisian language and culture. At the reference date
(March 2002), this member was Ms Tineke Steenmeijer-Wielenga, director of the Frisian Literary Museum and
Documentation Centre. In the case of the Literary Fund, the Frisian input is provided by the advisory councils
and reading committees, which are meant to possess a good knowledge of the Frisian language.
Letter dated 17 April 2002 from the Lytse Doarpen Association to the State Secretary for Education, Culture and
Science. The State Secretary responded by letter on 22 May 2002, ref. PO/KB/02-17538.

135

10.82 The Committee of Experts has been informed that users of Frisian are represented on
various bodies, such as the Fryske Akademy. However, in the committee’s opinion,
information on this issue is scarce. 364
10.83 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements in
fulfilment of the above- mentioned undertaking, as the issue has already been dealt
with in respect of the Netherlands Literary Production and Translation Fund (NLPVF)
and the Literary Fund (see sections 10.84 and 10.85).
10.84 The board of the NLPVF includes a member with a good knowledge of Frisian
literature and also makes use of the expertise of approximately ten advisors in this
particular area. 365
10.85 The board of the Literary Fund is assisted in its decision- making by an advisory
council. This council consists of at most thirteen members with a broad knowledge of
national and international literature and specific expertise in the fields of literary prose
(fiction and non- fiction), literary translation from various languages, poetry, drama,
children’s literature and Frisian literature. 366 The board of the Literary Fund also has
access to the knowledge and cooperation of almost 200 external experts, including
experts on Frisian books for children and young people, Frisian prose and Frisian
poetry. 367
Article 12(1)(g): encouraging the collection, presentation and publication of Frisian-language works
Article 12(1)(h): development of specific terminology

10.86 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook, with regard to
cultural activities and facilities – a non-exhaustive list of which appears in Article
12(1) of the Charter:
‘within the territory in which [the Frisian language is] used and to the extent that the
public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:
g
to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies responsible for
collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or publishing works produced in
[the Frisian language];
h
if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to maintaining and
developing appropriate administrative, commercial, economic, social,
technical or legal terminology in [the Frisian language].’
10.87 The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is fulfilling the abovementioned undertakings. 368

member with a good knowledge of Frisian literature on the board of the NLPVF came about on the basis of
article 5.3.6 of the second Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (1993).
Article 6 of the constitution of the Literary Fund stipulates that the board must ensure that it includes a member
with a good knowledge of Frisian literature.
In addition, the Literary Fund is responsible for the composition of the Frisian advisory committees that advise
the board on whether or not to award grants for Frisian-language literary activity, in accordance with the
applicable regulations (cf. articles 16 and 17 of the Fund’s bye-laws).

10.88 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân note that the Provincial and Buma Library is regarded by the
Minister of Education, Culture and Science and the provincial executive of Fryslân as
being of major importance because of its impressive collection geared to the study of
the Frisian language and history (Covenant 6.4.4). This importance is the result,
among other things, of the Provincial Library’s responsibilities with regard to the
preservation and presentation of Frisian- language works.
10.89 The publication of a Dutch-Frisian legal dictionary in 2000 is also worth mentioning
in this context. This dictionary is particularly important for the expansion of the
possibilities for using Frisian in administrative and legal matters. Thanks to the
dictionary, the Frisian language now possesses the necessary terminology for use in
judicial and administrative documents (see further section 10.36).
10.90 To promote the use of Frisian in legal practice, the Fryske Akademy will replace and
update a book of Frisian-language models for the notarial profession, entitled Fryske
modellen foar it notariaat (1979) (see sections 7.38 and 10.36). The Fryske Akademy
started the necessary translation work on 1 October 2001, supported by the Ministry
of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the province of
Fryslân, among others.
Article 12(2): cultural activities and facilities for the benefit of Friezen om Utens369

10.91 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘in respect of
territories other than those in which [the Frisian language is] traditionally used, if the
number of users of [the Frisian language] justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or
provide appropriate cultural activities and facilities in accordance with [Article 12(1)
of the Charter]’.
10.92 The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is fulfilling the abovementioned undertaking. 370
10.93 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that, working via the Frysk Boun om Utens, the
province will ensure that the same rules on course fees apply to people attending
Frisian- language courses outside the province of Fryslân as to those resident within
the province (Covenant 6.6.10).
10.94 In the light of the constitutional freedoms applying in the Netherlands, Frisians
resident outside the province of Fryslân are entitled to plan cultural activities and
provide facilities in accordance with Article 12(1) of the European Charter. Such
Frisians understandably make use of this possibility, usually in the organisational
context of Fryske Kriten (local Frisian associations), which are generally members of
the Frysk Boun om Utens, the national umbrella organisation of Frisian associations
outside the province of Fryslân. 371

‘Friezen om Utens’ is the Frisian term for Frisians who are not resident in the province of Fryslân.
Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 99.
Twenty-seven of the 30 Fryske Kriten om Utens are members of the Frysk Boun om Utens.

137

10.95 In accordance with Article 12(1) of the European Charter, the key aims of the Frysk
Boun om Utens and its member associations are:
•
encouraging activities in the field of Frisian literature, for example, lectures by
Frisian authors;
•
representing Friezen om Utens in Frisian organisations in Fryslân;
•
organising Frisian language courses;
•
organising training courses;
•
organising a Friezedei once every five years; 372 and
•
organising Frisian theatre and choir evenings. 373
10.96 In the framework of the promotion of the interests of the Friezen om Utens, the Frysk
Boun om Utens has in recent years lobbied for the ability to receive Omrop Fryslân’s
programmes outside the province of Fryslân. 374 In a letter dated 19 June 1998 to the
Media Authority, the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science singled out
the broadcasts of Omrop Fryslân as ‘a special case’ within the meaning of section
64a, subsection 2 of the Media Act, which permits the retransmission of these
programmes outside the province of Fryslân (cf. section 9.8, footnotes).
Article 12(3): foreign cultural policy

10.97 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to make appropriate
provision, in pursuing [its] cultural policy abroad, for [the Frisian language] and the
[culture it reflects]’.
10.98 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that, during the period until 1999, the
Netherlands encouraged the presentation of the Frisian culture and language alongside
the Dutch culture and language at various international events. The Committee
therefore concludes that the undertaking entered into by the Netherlands was fulfilled
during this period. 375
10.99 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed that they will strive to ensure that the Frisian language and
culture are represented at literary and cultural events outside the Netherlands
(Covenant 6.6.9).
10.100 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, central government and the
province of Fryslân further agreed that central government will ensure that Frisian
language and culture will have a clear place in the broader public information policy
of the Dutch embassies (Covenant 8.5).
10.101 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, central government and the
province of Fryslân further agreed that both parties will strive to ensure constructive

375

In 1998, a Friezedei – i.e. a Day for Frisians om Utens – in Apeldoorn attracted more than 1,000 participants. The
next Friezedei will take place in Enschede in 2003.
The Fryske Kriten that belong to the Frysk Boun om Utens include three choirs, two dance troupes and ten
theatre companies.
The Frysk Boun om Utens most recently expressed its wishes regarding the reception of Omrop Fryslân’s
programmes at its general meeting on 13 April 2002. At this meeting, it adopted a motion, which was brought to
the attention of the Minister of Education, Culture and Science, requesting inter alia that Omrop Fryslân’s
programmes be included in the ‘must carry’ package.

cooperation between areas in the member states of the Council of Europe where
regional or minority languages are spoken (Covenant 8.3). 376
10.102 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture, central government and the
province of Fryslân finally agreed that, when concluding and implementing cultural
conventions between the Netherlands and other member states of the Council of
Europe, central government will pay particular regard to the Frisian language and
culture and to the minority language or languages in the partner state (Covenant
8.3).377
10.103 In 1994-1995, in section 3.3 of the report on the implementation of the Covenant on
the Frisian Language and Culture (1993), the State Secretary for the Interior and
Kingdom Relations assured the House of Representatives of the States General that
the Frisian language and culture would be systematically included in the section on
‘mutual languages and cultures’ in bilateral agreements with third countries.
10.104 On 5 March 1997, the State Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and Education, Culture &
Science submitted a memorandum on the intensification of the Netherlands’ foreign
cultural policy to the House of Representatives of the States General. This
memorandum states that the key objective of international cultural cooperation is to
strengthen the international profile of the Netherlands and promote good mutual
relations with various countries, including neighbouring countries and the member
states of the European Union. 378 The memorandum also points out that such relations
often develop directly between persons and organisations, in which case the
government only needs to make available facilities and funding. A more active
involvement on the part of the government is therefore only required in less
straightforward cases.
10.105 The above- mentioned memorandum further notes that foreign cultural policy is being
increasingly decentralised. Not only funds like the Performing Arts Fund but also
umbrella organisations like the Netherlands Theatre Institute are free to conduct their
own foreign relations (see further section 10.108). Other cultural organisations, such
as theatre companies, are also entitled to conduct active foreign policies. Furthermore,
by means of a special budget for local cultural projects, a small number of Dutch
embassies have received greater freedom to tailor cultural programmes to local
circumstances (see section 10.116).
10.106 The additional funding that is available in the framework of the memorandum on the
intensification of foreign cultural policy is part of the Homogeneous Budget for
International Cooperation (HGIS). This funding is intended in particular for largescale activities, that is to say, activities whose scale exceeds the scope of the regular
budgets of the funds and ministries concerned. 379 The available budget for

The discussion of Article 14(b) of the European Charter also considers policies in relation to section 8.1 of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see sections 12.18 to 12.26).
The discussion of Article 14(a) of the European Charter also considers policies in relation to section 8.3 of the
Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see sections 12.7 and 12.14).
Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 1996-1997, 25 270, no. 1.
The financial lower limit for HGIS cultural projects which are dealt with by the two ministries themselves, was
raised from the beginning of 2001: see Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 2000-2001, 26 682,
no. 6, p. 2. In principle, only projects requiring subsidies of over NLG 250,000 (€113,445) are dealt with by the

139

international cultural cooperation under the HGIS (HGIS cultural funding) is managed
by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Education, Culture & Science and
allocated to specific large-scale projects. 380 A review of the HGIS cultural projects
approved between 14 July 1999 and September 2001 indicates that a subsidy was
granted to a project involving the Frisian language and culture for the first time during
this period. Thus, the professional Frisian- language Tryater theatre company received
funding to stage an international multilingual theatre project during the open-air Oerol
summer festival on Terschelling in June 2002. 381 Theatre companies from other
European regions with their own regional or minority languages, as defined in the
European Charter, also participated in this project.
10.107 On 15 October 1999, the State Secretary for Education, Culture & Science sent a
letter to the House of Representatives outlining the basic principles of Dutch
international cultural policy for 2001-2004, which will focus increasingly on clarity,
coherence and effectiveness. 382 For this purpose, the government will apply its
national cultural policy priorities to international cultural policy. It may therefore be
assumed that the above- mentioned activities in support of the Frisian language (see
sections 10.99 to 10.102) implicitly fall within the scope of Dutch international
cultural policy as well, although the above-mentioned letter does not state so
explicitly.
10.108 In 2001, in the framework of its international cultural policy, the Netherlands devoted
considerable attention to coordination and cooperation with professional cultural
organisations (funds, umbrella organisations and implementing organisations, as
referred to in section 10.105). On 9 January 2001, the State Secretaries for Foreign
Affairs and for Education, Culture & Science presented plans to further increase the
role of the funds in the allocation of HGIS cultural funding. 383 Some of these plans
were already implemented during 2001 by means of the conclusion of multi- year
agreements with sectoral organisations and the allocation of HGIS cultural funding to
the Mondriaan Foundation, the Performing Arts Fund and the Amateur Arts Fund, in
order to enable them to serve as channels for minor grant applications for HGIS
cultural funding. 384 In the assessment of the applications submitted to the above-

ministries. For projects on a smaller scale, recourse may be had to special funds, which have received additional
central government funding for this purpose (cf. section 10.108).
Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 1996-1997, 25 270, no. 1. The Homogeneous Budget for
International Cooperation (HGIS), established on 1 January 1997, constitutes a separate budgetary framework
within the state budget. The HGIS combines the foreign expenditure of the various ministries in one place,
making it possible to identify at a glance the most important expenditure made by the Netherlands each year in
the framework of international cooperation. An important underlying principle of the HGIS is the promotion of
cooperation and coordination between the ministries in the field of foreign affairs. In 2001, the HGIS operated
with a total of fifteen policy themes, including the theme of international cultural policy, for which the Ministries
of Education, Culture and Science and Foreign Affairs bear primary responsibility: cf. Parliamentary Papers II
(House of Representatives) 2001-2002, 28 380, no. 41.

mentioned funds, the basic principles for the allocation of HGIS cultural funding, as
formulated by the government, will remain the norm. In principle, professional and
amateur Frisian- language theatre companies are entitled to submit applications to the
above- mentioned funds, provided these applications comply with the criteria for
international cultural policy.
10.109 This report has already discussed subsidies from the Netherlands Literary Production
and Translation Fund (NLPVF) for foreign publishers and the international writers
programme, which may also be used by Frisian- language authors (cf. section 10.47).
These activities can therefore also be classified under the heading of foreign cultural
policy.
10.110 The NLPVF plays an important part in the promotion of Dutch literature at important
international book fairs, starting at the 1993 Frankfurt Book Fair, where the
Netherlands was one of the main exhibitors. 385 The NLPVF subsequently adopted a
systematic approach to activities aimed at promoting Dutch literature at international
book fairs. In 1995, Dutch literature featured at the annual international book fair for
the Spanish-speaking world in Barcelona (Liber ’95). In 1997, it was one of the key
topics at Scandinavia’s largest book fair, the Bökmassan, in Göteborg (Sweden). In
the context of the presentation of Dutch literature in Frankfurt and Barcelona, Frisian
literature was also brought to the attention of a wider segment of the foreign public.
The above- mentioned activities stopped in 1997, but were resumed in 1999 (see
section 10.111).
10.111 In early 1999, the Frisian poet Tsjêbbe Hettinga was a prominent figure at the
Literature of the Low Countries event during the London Festival of Literature. 386
This major literary event on Dutch and Flemish literature was organised by the
Frankfurter Buchmesse Foundation, which is responsible on behalf of the Netherlands
and Flanders for the joint international promotion of Dutch (and Frisian) literature.
The NLPVF is responsible for the actual implementation of these promotional
activities. The aforementioned translation into English of a piece of work by Hettinga
(see section 10.47) came about partly as the result of the London Festival. No Frisian
authors appeared at the 2001 Turin international book fair (Fiera del Libro Torino),
which included a large presentation of Dutch literature, but Frisian literature was
featured at the booth arranged by the NLPVF. The next book fair at which the NLPVF
will put in an appearance takes place in Paris in 2003.
10.112 In addition to these presentations at international book fairs, the NLPVF also arranged
for Frisian authors to participate in five different presentations and/or performances in
Germany during the 1999-2001 period. 387

10.113 The funding provided by the Literary Fund to writers and translators and the facilities
provided by the NLPVF may be classified partly under the promotion of Dutch
culture outside the Netherlands (see section 10.47).
10.114 The aim of the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) is to promote
the production, promotion and distribution of high-quality children’s books. This
international organisation, whose registered offices are located in Switzerland, counts
a Dutch branch among its more than 65 national branches. The Dutch branch, which
is currently chaired by a Frisian author of children’s books, includes Frisian- language
children’s books in its biennial nominations for the so-called IBBY List of Honour. It
is assisted in this by the Frysk Berneboek Foundation.
10.115 Certain activities of the Fryske Akademy (see section 10.38) and the Tryater theatre
company (see sections 10.20 and 12.26) also count as activities in the field of foreign
cultural policy. The relevant activities are funded from the regular budget of these
organisations, and not from the HGIS or grants from the aforementioned funds, with
the exception of Tryater’s international theatre project (see section 10.106). For more
information on foreign cultural policy, the reader is referred to the discussion of
Article 14 (Transfrontier exchanges) of the European Charter (see chapter 12).
10.116 The operationalisation of article 8.5 of the new Covenant on the Frisian Language and
Culture (2001) requires further attention. On 3 April 2002, the State Secretary for
Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the House of Representatives concerning the possibility
of improving the implementation of the international cultural policy of the
Netherlands at Dutch embassies in certain priority countries, through cooperation
between the embassies and Dutch academic institutes. 388 However, the letter did not
address the agreements concluded in the framework of the new Covenant on the
Frisian Language and Culture. In the past, Dutch embassies have organised activities
relating to Frisian. In 1987, for example, the Dutch embassy in Germany published a
booklet on the Frisian language. 389 In addition, in the past, the Dutch embassy in
Moscow arranged for the teaching of Frisian literature at the University of Kiev. As
far as can be ascertained, however, the Dutch embassies did not carry out any similar
activities during the 1999-2001 reporting period.
10.117 In summary, it appears that Dutch legislation complies with the provisions of Article
12 of the European Charter that were accepted by the Netherlands. With regard to the
comments of the Committee of Experts concerning Article 12(1)(e) of the Charter, the
reader is referred to the relevant paragraphs in this report (sections 10.76 to 10.80),
which explain how central government and the province of Fryslân are implementing
the provision in question. Concerning the presentation of Frisian language and culture
outside the Netherlands, Frisian bodies organising or supporting cultural activities
cooperate with national cultural funds, which have the status of autonomous
administrative authorities. In practice, although they are largely autonomous, these
national funds implement Dutch foreign cultural policy within the parameters
established by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, as long as this does not
involve large-scale projects. The Ministries of Education, Culture & Science and of

Foreign Affairs, not the cultural funds, are jointly responsible for decision- making
with regard to large projects. In the light of their scale, Frisian cultural projects
outside the Netherlands are frequently dependent on the national cultural funds for
funding. The agreements concluded in the framework of the Covenant on the Frisian
Language and Culture (2001) on the presentation of Frisian literature at important
international book fairs as part of the presentation of Dutch literature are part of a
tradition whose origins go back to the 1993 Frankfurt Book Fair. The Netherlands
Literary Production and Translation Fund plays an important part in this. The
importance of the HGIS cultural funding received by the funds (for example, the
Performing Arts Fund) to activities in the field of Frisian language and culture will
become clear in the coming years. Frisian still does not receive structurally explicit
attention, where possible, during the conclusion and implementation of cultural
treaties. The same applies with regard to the policies of Dutch embassies on public
information concerning the Dutch and Frisian languages and cultures in the
Netherlands.
11

Article 13: Economic and social life

11.1

With the entry into force of the Act of 22 November 2001, concerning the
introduction of the possibility of drawing up the constitutions of Frisian associations
and foundations in the Frisian language (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2001, 574), the
Dutch government has made it possible for associations and foundations to draw up
their constitutions and deeds of establishment in Frisian and enter them in the public
Commercial Register, provided the registered offices of the associations and
foundations concerned are located in the province of Fryslân. 390 As a result,
associations and foundations can henceforth participate in economic and social life in
the Frisian language.

11.2

The Committee of Experts considers that the undertakings entered into by the
Netherlands under Article 13 of the European Charter are being fulfilled. 391

11.3

The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) fleshes out the
implementation of the above-mentioned undertakings. In this context, particular
attention is devoted to improving the position of Frisian in social and health care
services subsidised by central government and the province whose sphere of
operatio ns includes the province of Fryslân.

11.4

In 2001, at the request of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations and the
provincial authority of Fryslân, the Coulon economic research agency conducted a
survey of language and language policy in the health sector in Fryslân. The survey
examined five branches of the health sector hospitals, nursing homes, mother and
toddler clinics, services for the disabled and mental health care (see section 11.37 et
seq.).

390

391

In response to questions from the MPs Van der Hoek, Middelkoop, Hoekema, Rijpstra and Atsma of 18
November 1999, the Minister of Justice said, speaking for the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom
Relations as well, that an act accommodating the desire of Frisian legal persons to enter Frisian-language
deeds of establishment in public registers and the protection of third parties wishing to consult those
registers was in preparation.
Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 101-106.

143

Article 13(1)(a): employment contracts, operating instructions, etc.

11.5

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘with regard to
economic and social activities […] within the whole country:
a
to eliminate from [its] legislation any provision prohibiting or limiting without
justifiable reasons the use of [the Frisian language] in documents relating to
economic or social life, particularly contracts of employment, and in technical
documents such as instructions for the use of products or installations.’

11.6

The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is generally fulfilling the
above-mentioned undertaking, but notes that one problem remains as regards the
Chamber of Commerce. Constitutions and deeds of establishment of associations and
foundations that are drawn up in Frisian cannot be registered with the Chamber of
Commerce unless the Civil Code is amended. In 2001, the Committee of Experts
noted that the Dutch government had expressed its wish to make this possible in the
near future by amending the law. 392 As noted in section 11.1, this amendment has now
been carried out.

11.7

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that central government will investigate what
constraints may exist on the use of Frisian in economic and social life and will strive
to ensure any necessary amendment of legislation (Covenant 7.1). In this regard, it is
worth noting that the parties also agreed that the province of Fryslân will over the
next few years give central government concrete indications of where legislation
including the phrase ‘the Dutch language’ can be amended to read ‘the Dutch and
Frisian languages’. For this purpose, central government has undertaken to endeavour
to update the 1987 study by the Berie foar it Frysk and the Fryske Akademy
(Covenant 3.5). 393 During the course of 2002, the Berie foar it Frysk took on the task
of bringing the study up to date.

11.8

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that the use of Frisian on labels and in product
instructions will not be prohibited. Central government will strive to ensure any
necessary amendment of legislation (Covenant 7.2).

11.9

The above- mentioned study of the Berie foar it Frysk and the Fryske Akademy
contained a list of statutory provisions on the use or limitation of the use of Frisian. It
appears from this list that, at the time of the study, the use of Dutch was mandatory in
certain areas of economic life. As a result, little or no room remained in these areas
for the use of Frisian.

11.10 It also emerges from the above- mentioned list that there are no statutory regulations
on the use of language in employment contracts. In practice, such agreements may be
drawn up in Frisian. This happens on a moderate scale, particularly in the case of the
bodies referred to in Article 12(1)(d) of the European Charter and local authorities in
the province of Fryslân. In view of the fact that written and signed employment
contracts may be regarded as non-notarial instruments, it is also worth referring to the

paragraphs concerning Article 9(2)(b) of the European Charter in this context (see
section 7.50).
11.11 It further emerges from the above-mentioned list that, pursuant to the Notaries Act in
force at that time, notarial deeds could be executed in the parties’ language of choice,
as long as the notary concerned understood the language in question. In this sense, the
use of Frisian in notarial deeds was already permitted, in so far as the law did not
provide otherwise (see sections 11.12 to 11.16). As of 1 October 1999, the amended
Notaries Act also permits the execution of bilingual and multilingual notarial deeds.
Thus, in addition to deeds executed in Frisian, notarial deeds may henceforth also be
executed in more than one language, where Frisian is one of those languages. 394 This
innovation has further expanded the scope for using Frisian in economic and social
life. Section 42, subsection 2 of the Notaries Act does not specify which version of a
bilingual or multilingual deed prevails with regard to the document’s legal effect. A
statutory rule on this issue was regarded as unnecessary and undesirable. 395 As a
matter of fact, the deed itself may stipulate which version prevails in the case of
interpretational problems.
11.12 As of 1 January 1997, the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act (the amended text of
which appeared in Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1996, 490) applies to the use of
Frisian in deeds that must be entered in public registers in accordance with statutory
provisions. The basic rule, as explained in section 7.40 of this report, is that
documents drawn up in Frisian, such as notarial deeds, require a literal translation into
Dutch. This translation is then entered in the relevant register, to which the Frisianlanguage documents are appended (section 8, subsections 1 and 2 of the Act). Section
8, subsection 4 of the Act allows for derogations from this basic rule in future
statutory regulations. The Civil Code has already made use of this possibility; the
Land Registry Act has not (see sections 11.13 to 11.16).
11.13 Section 41 of the Land Registry Act (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1989, 186; Bulletin
of Acts and Decrees 1996, 473) employs the above- mentioned basic rule with regard
to the use of Frisian in deeds that are entered in public registers. When a deed – such
as a deed transferring the ownership of a registered good or granting a mortgage – has
been executed not in Dutch, but, for example, in Frisian, a literal translation into
Dutch that has been declared equivalent by a sworn translator is entered in the public
registers for registered goods, pursuant to section 41 of the Land Registry Act. 396
Accordingly, the option of entering a bilingual deed in Dutch and Frisian, as referred
to in the amended Notaries Act (see section 11.11), does not apply to deeds that are
entered the public registers for registered goods. This statutory limitation may be
described as a limitation on the use of Frisian in economic and social life, as referred
to in the relevant provision of the European Charter.
According to the Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, the
failure to make use of the possibility offered by section 8, subsection 4 of the Use of
Frisian (Lega l Matters) Act (see section 11.12) can be satisfactorily justified. The
importance of the public interest in the smooth and orderly progress of legal matters
and the guarantee of legal certainty in legal matters concerning registered goods

145

makes it necessary to prevent the Land Registry Act from offering the possibility of
presenting documents in the Frisian language (or documents drafted in a foreign
language) for entry [in the relevant register]. The same applies to documents that have
been drafted in more than one language (documents drafted in Dutch and Frisian or
documents drafted in Dutch and a foreign language).
The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment therefore considers
that the provisions in the Land Registry Act concerning the use of Frisian in legal
matters concerning registered goods are in accordance with Articles 9(2)(b) and
13(1)(a) of the European Charter, as the latter now permits reservations of this kind.
In regard to the above, it is also worth noting that the Land Registry Act already
permits the drafting and presentation for entry in the public registers for registered
goods not only of notarial deeds and declarations, but also other Frisian- language
documents, provided they are accompanied by a literal translation into Dutch that has
been declared equivalent, which is then entered in the relevant register. The Frisianlanguage documents remain in the possession of the registrar.
Finally, it is worth noting that, in relation to existing statutory regulations in this area,
including those under section 41 of the Land Registry Act, the Minister of Justice
noted in the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the bill introducing the
possibility of drawing up the constitutions of Frisian associations and foundations in
the Frisian language (see Parliamentary Papers II (House of Representatives) 20002001, 27 647, no. 3), which was submitted on 26 March 2001, that there is no
evidence of problems that necessitate further investigation.
11.14 In this context, it is interesting to note that the first entry of a Frisian- language deed in
a public register, which involved the transfer of title to a house, took place in
Leeuwarden as long ago as 1 February 1949, while the related transfer in the land and
mortgage register took place in Heerenveen on 5 March 1949. 397 A researcher by the
name of Van der Velden, who discovered the transfer, wonders whether the entry of
the two deeds in these public registers may have conflicted with the legislation
prevailing at the time, as the deeds in question were drawn up exclusively in Frisian.
11.15 The Civil Code is relevant to the use of Frisian in deeds intended for entry in the
Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce. According to the list of statutory
provisions from 1987, as referred to in section 11.9, the use of Frisian in such deeds
was not permitted at that time. This limitation applied to the deeds of incorporation of
public and private limited companies as well as the deeds of establishment of
associations and foundations registered as legal persons. Pursuant to the relevant
provisions in the Civil Code, all these deeds had to be executed in Dutch. Frisian
cultural associations and foundations repeatedly demanded the abolition of this
limitation. This demand has now been met. As of 1 February 2002, the deeds of
establishment of associations and foundations whose registered offices are located in
the province of Fryslân may be executed and registered in Frisian if desired. Public
and private limited companies in the province of Fryslân did not feel a similar need
(see also section 11.23). The scope of the relevant amendment of the Civil Code
therefore does not extend to the deeds of incorporation of such companies.

11.16 For more information on the Act of 22 November 2001, introducing the possibility of
drawing up the constitutions of Frisian associations and foundations in the Frisian
language (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 2001, 574), the reader is referred to sections
7.41 to 7.44. In addition, it is also worth noting that the constitutions of associations
and foundations included in notarial deeds must mention, inter alia, the municipality
in the Netherlands where their registered offices are located (see article 27, paragraph
4 and article 286, paragraph 4 of Book II of the Civil Code). In doing so, they must
use the official name of the municipality, regardless of the language of the deed.
Thus, if the official name of the municipality is in Dutch, that name must also be used
in a deed that is otherwise drawn up entirely in Frisian. The same applies mutatis
mutandis: if the official name of the municipality is in Frisian, that name must also be
used in a deed that is otherwise drawn up entirely in Dutch. With regard to
foundations, article 286, paragraph 4 (a) of Book II of the Civil Code further
stipulates that the constitution of a foundation must include the name of the
foundation in question, including the word ‘stichting’ (foundation). In relation to
Frisian- language deeds, this provision may be understood as meaning that the Frisian
word ‘stifting’ can be used in place of the Dutch word ‘stichting’. 398
11.17 Since 1956, pursuant to section 1 of the Use of Frisian (Legal Matters) Act, anyone
who is required, pursuant to a statutory regulation, verbally to take an oath, or make a
solemn affirmation or reaffirmation shall be authorised to use, instead of the text
prescribed by law, the equivalent text in the Frisian language, unless the text of the
oath, solemn affirmation, or reaffirmation is partly or wholly laid down in the Dutch
constitution. This possibility is widely used in Frisian municipal councils and the
provincial council of Fryslân. At their swearing in, members of the House of
Representatives may also take the oath of office in Frisian. This option was utilised
for the first time in 1998. With the exception of the actual oath of office, which is
formulated in Dutch, the first Frisian-language swearing in of a notary took place on
7 April 1999. 399 The ceremony in question, which took place before Leeuwarden
district court, was that of E.L. Veerman, who was appointed to practise as a notary in
Buitenpost as of 1 January 2000.
11.18 The use of Frisian on labels and in product instructions is not prohibited, in so far as
the relevant provision only stipulates that the relevant indications and particulars
should at least appear in Dutch. 400 In the distant past, the Chamber of Commerce
opposed the use of Frisian on labels and in product instructions. For this reason,

Leeuwarder Courant, 7 April 1999. For the Dutch text of the oath, see section 3, subsection 2 of the
Notaries Act. Other acts, such as the Provinces Act and the Municipalities Act, also only contain the Dutch
text of the oath of office.
Article 23 of the Labelling of Foodstuffs (Commodities Act) Decree of 10 December 1991 (Bulletin of Acts
and Decrees 1991, 14) stipulates that, with the exception of the name of the producer of prepackaged foods
and beverages, the indications and particulars referred to in the Decree should at least appear in Dutch.
Article 16 of the European directive on the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs
(2000/13/EC) stipulates that member states must ensure that the particulars indicated on the labelling of
foodstuffs appear in a language easily understood by the consumer. In addition, member states may
stipulate that these particulars are given in one or more languages from among the official languages of the
Community. These provisions do not preclude labelling particulars from being indicated in several
languages, nor does European legislation preclude the use of regional or minority languages, within the
meaning of the European Charter, in this regard.

147

among others, central government and the province of Fryslân agreed in the Covenant
on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) that central government will strive to
ensure any necessary amendment of legislation (Covenant 7.2).
Article 13(1)(c) and (d): additional measures

11.19 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘with regard to
economic and social activities […] within the whole country:
c
to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of [the Frisian language] in
connection with economic or social activities;
d
to facilitate and/or encourage the use of [the Frisian language] by means other
than those specified in the above sub-paragraphs.’
11.20 The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is generally fulfilling the
undertaking entered into under Article 13(1)(c) of the Charter. However, with regard
to the Dutch Railways and the Dutch Postal Services, which both refuse to use Frisian
place names, the undertaking is not fulfilled (see sections 11.28 to 11.31). Otherwise,
the Committee considers that the Netherlands is meeting its obligations under Article
13(1)(d) of the Charter. 401
11.21 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will strive to ensure that the use of the Frisian
language is permitted in economic and social activities (Covenant 7.3).
11.22 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that, if they agree that projects to strengthen the
position of the Fris ian language in the economic and social sectors are necessary and
desirable, they will contribute jointly to the costs (Covenant 7.9).
11.23 When developing the measures referred to in articles 7.3 and 7.9 of the Covenant on
the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and the province of
Fryslân can make use of the findings of a recent study of the relationship between the
Frisian language and economic development. In 1999, Ab van Langevelde published
the results of his study of the nature of the reciprocal relationship between
bilingualism and economic development in Fryslân. 402 Among other observations, van
Langevelde notes that the boards of Frisian enterprises do not pay systematic attention
to bilingualism or government language policy and do not consider that bilingualism
has any bearing on the realisation of company goals. In addition, these bodies have
had problems with certain aspects of official language policy on more than one
occasion, particularly with regard to the policies developed by a number of Frisian
municipalities on official Frisian place names. 403
11.24 In its capacity as the provincial advisory body on Frisian language policy, the Berie
foar it Frysk has also immersed itself in the relationship between language and
economics on a number of occasions. This attention was a direct result of the

organisation’s amended terms of reference, formulated by the provincial authority in
1990, which calls on the organisation to devote special attention in its activities to
research and advice on the position of Frisian in the economic sphere. The Berie foar
it Frysk and other institutions also launched various activities to facilitate and/or
encourage the use of Frisian in economic and social life (see sections 11.25 to 11.27).
11.25 In 1995, the Berie foar it Frysk organised a one-day seminar for advertising agencies
and entrepreneurs on the practical applications and limitations of the use of Frisian in
advertising. At this time, Omrop Fryslân had only recently introduced advertising in
its regional radio and television broadcasts. The percentage of Frisian- language radio
and television advertisements fell short of the expectations of Omrop Fryslân’s
listeners and viewers, who were accustomed to Frisian being the broadcasting
organisation’s main language of communication. As a consequence of the abovementioned seminar, AFUK’s Frisian Language Support Centre (Stipepunt Frysk)
established a library of Frisian voice recordings for the benefit of advertising
companies. This library has collected a wide variety of voices. Today, advertising
companies are increasingly making use of Frisian in a creative manner, often in
combination with Dutch, in radio and television advertising.
11.26 In 1992, the Ried fan de Fryske Beweging took the first steps towards the
establishment of a prize for the best Frisian- language radio and television
advertisements, which have been awarded annually since 1999. The fifth prize- giving
ceremony, organised in cooperation with the commercial associations of Fryslân, took
place in Leeuwarden in 2001 and included the presentation of an audience award.
Four hundred entrepreneurs and other interested parties attended the ceremony. The
originality of the advertisements and the skilful, i.e. non-folkloristic, use of the Frisian
language are important criteria in the eyes of the jury. The number of Frisianlanguage advertisements increases each year. In 2001, a total of 47 radio
advertisements and 25 television advertisements were produced and broadcast in
Frisian.
11.27 In 1995-1996, AFUK’s Frisian Language Support Centre organised a campaign
promoting the use of Frisian on menus in restaurants and cafes. AFUK now offers a
fast translation service for short texts such as menus. Many restaurants and cafes have
a Frysk menu, but fully bilingual menus are still not very common.
11.28 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains no agreements on
the use of Frisian place names by Dutch Railways, PTT Post and KPN Telecom. In
fact, such agreements are no longer necessary, as the three companies now use official
Frisian- language place names in their databases. The policies of the companies are
discussed in the following paragraphs (sections 11.29 to 11.31).
11.29 Since 1998, the Dutch telecommunications company KPN Telecom (formerly PTT
Telecom) has amended the entries for official Frisian place names in its telephone
directories by listing them in Frisian, while referring to these Frisian- language entries
under their Dutch equivalents. 404 On checking individual subscribers, it emerges that
KPN Telecom uses the correct versions of official Frisian place names in its telephone
directories on CD-ROM. On checking individual subscribers in the telephone

The Gouden Gids (Yellow Pages) has used official Frisian place names since 1997.

149

directory on the internet, however, it emerges that KPN Telecom still uses the
incorrect, Dutch- language version of official Frisian place names.
11.30 As of 1 September 2000, the Dutch postal service TPG Post (formerly PTT Post) has
incorporated official Frisian-language place names in its postcode databases, which
are used by the administrative authorities (see section 8.51). The decision of TPG Post
to incorporate Frisian- language place names in these databases implies that these
changes were also made to the company’s commercial databases. During the
transitional period, the Dutch-language versions of these place names still appear in
the databases, together with references to the official Frisian- language names.
11.31 As of 30 May 1999, Dutch Railways use the official Frisian- language place names of
the two places tha t qualify for such treatment, both at the stations and in their
timetables. 405
Article 13(2)(b): economic and social sectors (public sector)

11.32 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘with regard to
economic and social activities […] within the territory in which [the Frisian language
is] used, and as far as this is reasonably possible:
b
in the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public sector),
to organise activities to promote the use of [the Frisian language].’
11.33 The Committee of Experts has found no evidence that such activities have taken place
and thus cannot conclude that the Netherlands is fulfilling this undertaking. 406
11.34 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will strive to ensure that the use of the Frisian
language is permitted in economic and social activities (Covenant 7.3).
11.35 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that, if they agree that projects to strengthen the
position of the Frisian language in the economic and social sectors are necessary and
desirable, they will contribute jointly to the costs (Covenant 7.9).
11.36 During the 1999-2001 reporting period, the Ministry of Economic Affairs did not
undertake any activities or adopt any measures that focused wholly or partly on the
Frisian language. In addition, the Ministry did not make use of the possibility
available under section 2:9, subsection 2 of the General Administrative Law Act to
make rules on the use of Frisian in written documents for central government bodies,
in so far as they fall within the relevant Minister’s competence (see section 3.7.7). 407

407

In May 1999, the operations of Dutch Railways in the province of Fryslân were partially taken over by
NoordNed Personenvervoer B.V. With regard to the use of Frisian place names, NoordNed has maintained
its predecessor’s policies.

Article 13(2)(c): care sector: retirement homes, hospitals, etc.

11.37 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘with regard to
economic and social activities, […] in so far as the public authorities are competent,
within the territory in which [the Frisian language is] used, and as far as this is
reasonably possible:
c
to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes and
hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in their own language
persons using [the Frisian language] who are in need of care on grounds of illhealth, old age or for other reasons.’
11.38 In its report, the Committee of Experts notes that there is no clear information
available about the use of Frisian in the above- mentioned social care facilities. The
Committee considers that the Netherlands has partially fulfilled its undertakings under
Article 13(2)(c) of the Charter. The Committee further notes that there is an urgent
need for Frisian-speaking staff in such institutions, as well as a serious shortage of
funds to provide the necessary training. 408
11.39 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that they will strive to ensure that governmentsubsidised social care institutions whose sphere of operations includes the province of
Fryslân pay due regard to the Frisian language (Covenant 7.4)
11.40 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will strive to ensure that governmentsubsidised social care institutions whose sphere of operations includes the province of
Fryslân pay due regard to the Frisian language, both generally and in their annual
reports (Covenant 7.4 and 7.5).
11.41 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed with regard to speech therapy that the province
will strive to ensure that testing and therapeutic materials used in speech therapy are
examined to ensure their suitability for use in the particular bilingual situation in
Fryslân; that the province will strive to ensure that Frisian as well as Dutch-language
testing and therapeutic materials are available for the treatment of aphasia patients and
children with speech defects; and that the province will consult with speech therapists
in Fryslân on the implementation of Frisian- language testing and therapeutic materials
(Covenant 7.6).
11.42 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will strive to ensure that the
complaints schemes of social care institutions subsidised by central government and
the province whose sphere of operations includes the province of Fryslân will pay due
regard to the position of the Frisian language (Covenant 7.7). In addition, the province
will strive to ensure that interest groups in the social care sector that are active in the
province of Fryslân pay due regard to the use of Frisian in their work (Covenant 7.8).

11.43 The publication of the findings of a survey conducted by the Coulon economic
research agency at the request of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations
and the provincial authority of Fryslân partly makes up for the lack of clear
information on the use of Frisian in the health sector noted by the Committee of
Experts (see section 11.33). As a matter of fact, the survey does not corroborate the
aforementioned urgent need for Frisian-speaking staff in social care institutions or the
lack of funds to provide the necessary training, but recommends establishing
demonstration language projects and providing courses aimed at increasing the
Frisian- language skills of Dutch-speaking senior staff. In addition, the report
recommends devoting systematic attention to Frisian in MBO (secondary vocational
education) and HBO (higher professional education) courses for work in the care
sector. 409
11.44 The survey further notes that Frisian is used primarily in informal situations, among
close colleagues and in contacts with clients, while Dutch is the predominant choice
for communicating with managers and in formal situations. In addition, the survey
notes that Frisian is used least often in mother and toddler clinics, and most often in
services for the disabled. The general attitude towards Frisian is positive, but declines
in the presence of concrete situations or measures. 410
11.45 The survey examines five different branches of the health sector: hospitals, nursing
homes, mother and toddler clinics, services for the disabled and mental health care. 411
Among its various findings, the survey indicates that the command of Frisian among
staff, clients and patients corresponds with that of the inhabitants of the province of
Fryslân. The survey also identifies differences in language skills between the various
branches. Staff and residents of nursing homes and staff providing services for the
disabled demonstrate an above-average command of Frisian, while staff of mother
and toddler clinics demonstrate a below-average command. 412
11.46 With regard to the development and execution of language policies in the Frisian care
sector, the survey notes that Frisian hospitals generally devote little or no attention to
Frisian and/or bilingualism, although various hospitals have taken incidental measures
with regard to Frisian, including the purchase of Frisian- language books for hospital
libraries and participation in Frisian language courses. The Tjongerschans hospital in
Heerenveen has designated Dutch as the language of communication within the
institution, whereas other hospitals have not made declarations of this kind. 413
11.47 None of the nursing homes in Fryslân has developed policies on the use of Frisian, but
staff frequently make use of Frisian on the wards. 414 Language is not an issue in
mother and toddler clinics. 415 Services for the disabled and mental health care services
have not developed language policies either, but, depending on the location, there do
exist opportunities to use Frisian on the wards. 416 Revalidatie Fryslân, an organisation

located at the intersection of the education and health sectors, has developed official
language rules for its work, but its staff are not familiar with them. 417
11.48 The authors of the survey conc lude that it would be advisable to devote attention to
Frisian bilingualism in the quality assurance policies of the various organisations. 418
They then make various specific recommendations for improving the position of
Frisian in the health sector.
11.49 In summary, it appears that no reliable answer is available to the question whether or
not Dutch legislation complies fully with the provisions from Article 13 of the
European Charter that have been accepted by the Netherlands, due in part to the
absence of an up-to-date list of statutory provisions on the use of the Frisian language
and limitations on its use. At present, such a list is being prepared, in accordance with
article 3.5 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001). In addition,
the Covenant contains a number of agreements concluded between central
government and the province of Fryslân on the use of Frisian in economic and social
life. The use of Frisian in the social care sector is the subject of special attention in the
new Cove nant.

Article 14: Transfrontier exchanges

12.1

In 1996, the Dutch government identified strengthening the international profile of the
Netherlands and stimulating good relations with certain countries, including
neighbouring countries and the member states of the European Union, as the key
objectives of the intensification of Dutch foreign cultural policy. In addition, in its
cultural policy document for 2001-2004, Cultuur als confrontatie, the government
formulated the basic principles of its international cultural policy for 2001-2004.
Neither the key objectives of 1996 nor the basic principles for 2001-2004 refer to the
undertakings entered into by the Netherlands under Articles 12(3) and 14 of the
European Charter (see also sections 10.104 to 10.107).

12.2

The province of Fryslân formulated its policy on international contacts in the field of
bilingualism in 1987 (Provincial Bulletin 1998, 4) and operates a grants scheme for
such contacts. The purpose of the scheme is to support international exchanges
between minority language areas in Europe, by means of occasional grants, in order to
strengthen the position of Frisian.

12.3

The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is generally fulfilling its
undertakings under Article 14 of the European Charter. 419

12.4

According to the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), one of the
objectives of the international cultural policy of central government and the province
of Fryslân is that the unique position of Frisian in the Netherlands is recognised
internationally. 420 This will require proper public information. The Covenant goes on
to note that it is important to be able to compare the situation of language minorities
elsewhere in Europe with that of Frisian-speakers. Within the context of the European

Union, however, it is still more important that Fryslân should be able to project its
own identity and that areas with their own regional or minority languages are given a
chance to cooperate with each other. For Fryslân, relations with the German regions
of North and East Friesland are particularly important in this regard.
Article 14(a): bilateral agreement on the Frisian language between the Netherlands and Germany

12.5

On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘to apply existing
bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind them with the states in which the
same language is used in identical or similar form, or if necessary to seek to conclude
such agreements, in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of the same
language in the states concerned in the fields of culture, education, information,
vocational training and permanent education.’

12.6

The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is generally fulfilling the
above- mentioned undertaking, but encourages the government to explain in its next
periodical report how it intends to further promote transfrontier exchanges (see
sections 12.8 and 12.14). 421

12.7

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân agreed that, when concluding and implementing cultural
conventions between the Netherlands and other member states of the Council of
Europe, central government will pay particular regard to the Frisian language and
culture and to the minority language or languages in the partner state (Covenant
8.3).422

12.8

In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will strive to ensure that sufficient
resources will be provided to establish and promote cultural and educational
exchanges between the Dutch province of Fryslân and the German regions of East and
North Friesland (Covenant 8.4).

12.9

Before considering the policy of the Netherlands and Germany on Frisian language
and culture, this report provides a brief description of German government policy in
this area. However, since the German Länder bear primary responsibility for cultural
policy, this description actually focuses on Schleswig- Holstein and Lower Saxony.

12.10 In 1998, the Landtag (parliament) of Schleswig- Holstein, which is located in Kiel,
established a Gremium für Fragen der friesischen Bevölkerung im Lande SchleswigHolstein. This committee consists of the president of the Landtag, one member from
each of the political parties represented in it, the North-Frisian members of the
German Bundestag in Berlin, the Grenzlandbeauftragte, a representative from
Schleswig- Holstein’s Ministry of Culture in Kiel, and four representatives from the
Frisian minority in the region of North Friesland. The committee meets at least twice
a year under the chairmanship of the president of Landtag of Schleswig-Holstein in

421

Council of Europe, Report of the Committee of Experts, 107.
The discussion of Article 12(3) of the European Charter also considers central government policy in relation
to article 8.3 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see sections 10.102 and 10.117).

154

Kiel. The committee’s activities are aimed at supporting and encouraging Frisian
language and culture in the region of North Friesland. 423
12.11 In addition to the Establishment of the above-mentioned committee, a provision was
incorporated into article 5 of the constitution of Schleswig-Holstein in 1990
concerning the right of the Frisian minority in the region of North Friesland to support
and protection. 424 A similar provision with regard to Sater Frisian does not appear in
the constitution of Lower Saxony.
12.12 Since 1986, the government of Schleswig- Holstein has reported regularly to the
Landtag on the status of minorities within Schleswig-Holstein. The status of North
Frisian was first discussed in a meeting on 4 June 1987 and was subsequently
included in the ‘broad’ minorities reports, which focus on both the Danish minority in
Schleswig- Holstein and the German minority in South Jutland (Denmark). Following
the meeting of 4 June 1987, Frisian was discussed in the framework of these
minorities reports at Landtag meetings on 22 January 1992, 26 January 1996 and 18
November 1999. 425
12.13 Since 1 January 1999, North Frisian has fallen under the scope of the European
Charter in Schleswig-Holstein, which has endorsed 36 policy measures from Part III
of the Charter in relation to North Frisian. At the same time, Lower Saxony has
endorsed 35 policy measures from Part III of the Charter in relation to Sater Frisian.
On 18 December 2000, the Federal Republic of Germany submitted its first report to
the Council of Europe in the framework of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages. 426
12.14 There are no cultural agreements between the Netherlands and Schleswig- Holstein or
Lower Saxony that identify Frisian as an area of common interest. The 1961 cultural
treaty between the Netherlands and Germany does not explicitly mention Frisian
either, altho ugh the treaty can serve as a basis for cultural exchanges in the fields of
culture, education, youth, etc., that involve Frisian language and culture. 427 The fields
of education and research, in particular, are characterised by close contacts and
regular cooperation between the institutions concerned (including the Fryske
Akademy in Leeuwarden, the Ostfriesische Landschaft in Aurich, the Nordfriisk
Institut in Bredstedt and the Nordisch Institut of the Christian Albrechts University in
Kiel). In addition, the Fryske Rie and the Frysk Ynternasjonaal Kontakt also play a
part in promoting transfrontier exchanges (see sections 12.19 to 12.24).

Section 10.6 of the first Report on the measures adopted by the Netherlands in respect of the Frisian
language and culture refers to the post of Beauftragter der Regierung für Grenzlandfragen. However, the
official title of the post is Beauftragter der Ministerpräsidentin für Fragen der deutschen und dänischen
Minderheiten und für friesische Angelegenheiten. In practice, as well as in the official Minderheitenbericht,
this honorary post is referred to as Grenzlandbeauftragte.

As of 3 October 1990, the above-mentioned cultural treaty applies unamended to the entire territory of the
Federal Republic of Germany, pursuant to the Protocol between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the

Article 14(b): facilitating and/or promoting transfrontier cooperation

12.15 On accepting the European Charter, the Netherlands undertook ‘for the benefit of [the
Frisian language], to facilitate and/or promote cooperation across borders, in
particular between regional or local authorities in whose territory the same language is
used in identical or similar form’.
12.16 The Committee of Experts considers that the Netherlands is generally fulfilling the
above- mentioned undertaking, but notes that central government ceased funding
transfrontier exchanges between the Dutch province of Fryslân and the German
regions of East and North Friesland in 1996. The Committee encourages the
government to explain in its next periodical report how it intends to further promote
transfrontier exchanges. 428 For more information, see sections 12.17, 12.20 and 12.21.
12.17 In the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001), central government and
the province of Fryslân further agreed that they will strive to ensure that sufficient
resources will be provided to establish and promote cultural and educational
exchanges between the Dutch province of Fryslân and the German regions of East and
North Friesland (Covenant 8.4).
12.18 The Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) contains agreements on the
promotion of transfrontier exchanges. In the Covenant, central government and the
province of Fryslân agreed that they will strive to ensure constructive cooperation
between areas of member states of the Council of Europe in which regional or
minority languages are spoken (Covenant 8.1). 429 The province will also make a
financial contribution to the Fryske Rie and the European Bureau for Lesser-Used
Languages (Covenant 8.2).
12.19 The Fryske Rie foundation, which was established in 1956, aims to foster social and
cultural contacts between Frisians in Fryslân and the regions of North and East
Friesland. Since 11 September 1998, the Fryske Rie has participated in the
Ynterfryske Rie, of which it is one of the founders. The Ynterfryske Rie is an
umbrella organisation for the Fryske Rie in Fryslân and its two counterparts in North
and East Friesland. In addition to an annual programme of exchanges in the field of
Frisian language and culture, the Ynterfryske Rie organises an Ynterfrysk Kongres,
where topical and common issues are discussed before a wide audience once every
three years. The three organisations that participate in the Ynterfryske Rie take it in
turns to organise this conference. In 2000, the Fryske Rie’s East Frisian counterpart
organised the conference, which took place in Jever.
12.20 Until 1996, the Fryske Rie received an annual subsidy from the Ministry of Welfare,
Health and Cultural Affairs. This ended when the Ministry’s welfare memorandum
for 1995-1998 did not include the Fryske Rie in the national infrastructure to be
awarded grants. 430 As a result, the welfare memorandum for 1999-2002 does not even
mention the Fryske Rie. 431

The discussion of Article 12(3) of the European Charter also considers national and provincial policy in
relation to article 8.1 of the Covenant on the Frisian Language and Culture (2001) (see sections 10.101 to

12.21 The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science honoured the Fryske Rie’s request for
a grant to organise a transfrontier language course in 2002 with a one-off grant of
€4,537.432
12.22 The Fryske Rie receives an annual grant from the province of Fryslân to foster
contacts with East and North Friesland by means of exchanges and the abovementioned conference. During the 1999-2001 reporting period, the grant was worth
€3,700 per year. In addition to this regular grant, the province of Fryslân awards ad
hoc grants for specific activities, but turned down a request to provide structural
funding for the activities of the Ynterfryske Rie, the platform for cooperation between
the Fryske Rie (Fryslân), the Friesenrat (East Friesland) and the Frasche Rädj (North
Friesland).
12.23 Frysk Ynternasjonaal Kontakt is an organisation for 15 to 35-year-olds that aims to
raise the awareness of young Frisian people regarding their own language and culture.
International contacts between speakers of regional or minority languages in the
member states of the Council of Europe play a key role in this regard. The
organisation does not receive structural funding for its activities from central
government or the province of Fryslân, although the latter subsidises the
organisation’s activities in the framework of the provincial scheme ‘ynternasjonale
kontakten op it mêd fan twataligens’ (international contacts in bilingualism) (see
annexe 1.2). In addition, the organisation makes frequent and successful use of the
European Commission’s subsidy programme for youth.
12.24 During the reporting period 1999-2001, Frysk Ynternasjonaal Kontakt organised three
different activities per year and participated in a further six activities in Germany,
Italy (twice), Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. This involved activities specifically
intended for German and Dutch Frisian-speakers, as well as meetings with
representatives of other regional or minority languages, including North Frisian and
Sater Frisian.
12.25 Since 1983, the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages has operated a
programme of annual study visits to areas in the member states of the European Union
where regional or minority languages are spoken. The Bureau has so far organised
over 105 study visits for a total of 1,140 participants. 433 A number of Frisians have
participated in these visits, and Fryslân has served as a destination on a number of
occasions. A unique type of European exchange programme, known as Euroschool,
involves primary school pupils from areas where regional or minority languages are
spoken. Between 25 and 30 Frisian pupils participated in the Euroschool programmes
that took place on the Western Isles of Scotland in 1999 and in Ladinia (Italy) in
2001.
12.26 Since 1997, the Frisian theatre company Tryater has been a co-founder and lynchpin
of Offspring, the European network of theatre companies performing in regional or
minority languages. As there are no theatre companies similar to Tryater in North

Friesland and the Saterland, the company’s activities involve contacts with users of
different rather than similar or identical regional or minority languages. The aim of
Offspring is to stimulate young people’s interest in regional- language theatre.
Approximately 40 theatre companies are associated with Offspring. In 1999, six
companies participated in an initiatory meeting on Terschelling, which subsequently
led to study visits to the Lausitz region, Catalonia, Fryslân, Occitania and Wales. 434
A Tryater production entitled ‘Geweld … nee’ was translated into and performed in
Frisian. In October 2000, Tryater participated in and performed at a theatre festival in
Nimes (Occitania) organised by Offspring. In 2001, the company organised
workshops for young actors. In 2002, it participated in the Oerol festival on
Terschelling, made possible in part by means of cultural funding under the
Homogeneous Budget for International Cooperation (HGIS) (see sections 10.20 and
10.115).
12.27 Provincial and local authorities are free to establish ties of friendship or twinnings
with other regions or municipalities where the regional or minority language and
culture occupy an important place in social and cultural life. In spite of this, the
Frisian municipalities and the province of Fryslân have yet to establish such links

(1999-2000-2001)
Responsible editor: Auke van der Goot
Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations
The Hague 2003

Low Saxon languages in the Netherlands

1

Introduction

1.1 Several variants of Low Saxon are spoken in the provinces of Groningen, Drenthe and
Overijssel, in the municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf in the southeastern
part of the province of Fryslân, and in the regions Achterhoek and Veluwe in the province of
Gelderland. The greatest divergence is found in the province of Drenthe, between east and
west in the province of Overijssel (Twente and Salland, respectively), between east and west
in the province of Gelderland (Achterhoek and Veluwe), and between northwest and
southeast in the province of Groningen. The Stellingwerfs variant is spoken in the
municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf in the southeastern part of the
province of Fryslân and in adjacent parts of Drenthe and the northwestern part of Overijssel.
In the northeastern part of Ooststellingwerf Frisian is spoken as an everyday language.
1.2 The population of the area where Low Saxon languages are spoken totals approximately
3,000,000. A study by the regional radio station in the province of Groningen showed that
about 65% of the inhabitants of the province were able to speak the Gronings variant of Low
Saxon. It is estimated that in the entire Low Saxon linguistic area about 1,800,000 people can
speak Low Saxon.
1.3 Since the previous report (1999/2000), there have been no new language census results.
But on 1 May 2002 – the reference date for this report – the Low Saxon Institute at
Groningen University was preparing a large-scale survey for the whole Low Saxon linguistic
region in cooperation with SONT (see 1.4). The new survey will be based on an earlier pilot
in Weststellingwerf. However, it will only go ahead if there is a guarantee of funding to cover
the entire project. Financial contributions are to be made by all the Dutch provinces in the
Low Saxon linguistic region, the municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf, the
municipality of Steenwijk and the Planten Fund. An application to the VSB Fund is still
under consideration. The survey is to be conducted under the aegis of Dr H. Bloemhoff
(regional language officer for Stellingwerfs), Professor H. Niebaum (professor of Low
Saxon) and Professor S. Reker (professor of Gronings).
In addition, there are plans for a new statistically representative telephone survey of residents
of the Low Saxon linguistic region in the province of Gelderland. This survey is to be
conducted by a specialist market research bureau. Funding commitments for this have been
received from e.g. the Zutphen-based Planten Fund.
1.4 There are in the Netherlands various bodies and organisations that seek to preserve and
develop the Low Saxon languages. SONT, the federation of regional and local language
182

associations in the Low Saxon linguistic region, is an umbrella organisation of 21
associations that focus on Low Saxon languages in fields varying from plays in Low Saxon to
research into local language. Names and addresses are listed in Annexe I.
1.5 At the time of the parliamentary debates on the Bill to ratify the Charter, the Dutch
government was asked to consider the Low Saxon languages as regional languages within the
meaning of the Charter. In consultation with the provincial authorities concerned and on the
basis of opinions put forward by linguists, the Dutch government acceded to this request. In
accordance with this decision, the principles enumerated in Part II of the Charter are being
applied to the Low Saxon languages used in the Netherlands.
1.6 The text of the Charter is published in English and French in the Netherlands Treaty
Series 1993. 447 The Dutch translation was published in the Netherlands Treaty Series 1993,
199. Netherlands Treaty Series 1998, 20 (at letter C) is also relevant to the Dutch translation.
In 1996 the Netherlands ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
after a Bill to this effect had been passed by the Lower House of the Dutch Parliament on 19
October 1995 and by the Upper House on 23 January 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees
1996, 136).
1.7 For the purposes of this report, the Dutch government has consulted the provincial
authorities of Drenthe, Fryslân, Gelderland, Groningen and Overijssel, and the municipal
authorities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf. SONT, the umbrella organisation, was
consulted by the provincial and local authorities. Part of the information in this report was
derived from the Mini- Guide to the Lesser Used Languages of the EU (Brussels, 1998). The
regional language officers subsidised by the relevant provinces in Groningen, Drenthe,
Overijssel, Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf also provided supplementary information.
The reference date for this report is 1 May 2002.
1.8 Following the first information-gathering operation in 1999-2000, the committee of
experts (referred to in Article 16, paragraph 3, of the European Charter) visited the
Netherlands in February 2000 to gather additional information from civil-society
organisations promoting Low Saxon. In early 2001, the committee of experts set out its
findings and recommendations, based on the information gathered during the working visit
and on the government report on the Low Saxon languages.
1.9 At its 765th meeting, on 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the Council
of Europe took note of the committee of experts' report. The Committee of Ministers has
made certain recommendations, which are also relevant to Low Saxon. The report and the
recommendations can be consulted on the Council of Europe's local and regional democracy
website: www.coe.int/local.
1.10 The Netherlands was advised to develop a national language policy on Low Saxon and
the other languages protected under Part II of the European Charter in accordance with the
objectives and principles set out in Part II.
1.11 The Netherlands Government's policy consists of making local and regional authorities
in the Low Saxon linguistic region primarily responsible for developing policy on Low Saxon
447

Council of Europe. Report of the Committee of Experts on the application of the Charter: The Netherlands,
ECRML (2001)1, Strasbourg, 20 September 2001.

183

in accordance with the obligations entered into under the European Charter. The emphasis
and intensity of policy will vary from one province or municipality to another, depending on
the situation of each Low Saxon dialect. The local and provincial authorities, which have an
intimate knowledge of the needs in this area, have developed various new initiatives on Low
Saxon since the committee of experts' visit. The province of Gelderland has taken seriously
the concern expressed by the committee of experts about its policy on Low Saxon. 448 This
report describes its response – and the policy pursued in the other provinces in the northeast
of the Netherlands – in more detail.

Application of Article 7

2.1 Article 7, paragraph 1.a
The Dutch government, by ratifying the Charter in 1996, recognises the contribution of the
Low Saxon languages to the cultural wealth of our country. Dutch policy thereby accords
with Article 7, paragraph 1.a, as the committee of experts noted. 449 Local and regiona l
authorities in the entire Low Saxon linguistic region have a primary responsibility to develop
a policy favouring these regional languages. Depending on the situation of each of the Low
Saxon languages, the provincial and local authorities have taken several initiatives in this
respect and have based their policies on the following objectives:
2.1.1

Province of Drenthe

The following policy documents have been published:
1982 ‘Provincial policy on the cultural heritage of Drenthe’
1995 ‘Art and culture in Drenthe’
1997 ‘Regional culture and literature’
1999 The provinces of Drenthe, Fryslân and Groningen and the cities of Groningen and
Leeuwarden jointly laid down their aspirations for regional languages in the policy
document 'Northern Cultural Compass'.
2002 Letter on the ‘State of play in cultural policy’ from the Provincial Executive to the
province's Culture and Welfare Committee
The province of Drenthe’s current policy on local language is laid down in the 1997 subpolicy document on regional culture and literature. It contains ten policy proposals relating to
language, of which RC 19 is considered the most significant. RC 19: ‘We shall continue to
promote the use and acceptance of Drents alongside Dutch, at all levels of society and in
various social sectors, with particular emphasis on the use of Drents in the media, education,
the courts and administration, as well as in cultural activities and exchanges.’

Province of Fryslân (municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf)

1977

First policy proposals submitted to the Speaker of the Lower House, Dr A. Vondeling,
in a report entitled ‘Veerder mit et Stellingwerfs’
The provincial authority of Fryslân asked the two municipalities to take an official
stance on Stellingwerfs
Positive stance concerning the local language explicitly laid down in council
decisions on a number of occasions. The municipal executives of Ooststellingwerf
and Weststellingwerf undertook to protect the local culture and language of
Stellingwerf, if possible in cooperation with other authorities. It was also agreed by
the local councils that Dutch is the official language in both municipalities, but that

members of the public may use Stellingwerfs in their dealings with the local
authorities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf.
Establishment of an intermunicipal working group on Stellingwerfs
The final report by the provincial working party on the use of Frisian in official
matters, entitled 'Fan geunst nei Rjocht' (From favour to right) also looks at the
position of Stellingwerfs. The municipal authorities bear primary responsibility for
local languages, while the provincial and central authorities bear secondary
responsibility.
Final advisory report by the intermunicipal working group.
The two municipal executives fully acknowledged their policy responsibility in a
council decision stating that 'regional languages have a historic and a living value and
that the wealth of uniquely regional expression they represent is worthy of
preserva tion. The central aim as far as the linguistic policy of Stellingwerf
municipalities is concerned will be to strive to keep the regional language alive
alongside and equal to standard Dutch (ABN).'
The provincial executive of Fryslân indicated that it favoured ‘non-prescriptive
language policy’, thus placing primary administrative responsibility with the
municipal executives of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf.
The provinces of Drenthe, Fryslân and Groningen and the cities of Groningen and
Leeuwarden jointly laid down their aspirations for regional languages in the policy
document 'Northern Cultural Compass'.
The executives of both municipalities Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf have
decided to maintain the activities of the regional language officer for some years to
come. These activities relate to research, the production of language aids and the
provision of advice on correct language usage. Priority is being given to e.g. the
development of a Dutch-Stellingwerfs dictionary, a map showing the names of
villages, roads, bodies of water and other major topographical features in
Stellingwerfs, and an official glossary.
The municipal executives have also decided to cooperate on further planning with a
view to an intensification of action on the Stellingwerfs language (see also subsection
2.3.2). This was decided at meetings of the executives on 19 and 26 February 2002,
respectively. The decision is recorded in a joint letter to the Provincial Executive of
Fryslân dated 7 March 2002.
Province of Gelderland

In order to support research into and awareness of the unique local heritage of the Achterhoek
and the Liemers districts, the Staring Institute receives subsidies from provincial and local
authorities.

2001

Publication of policy document ‘Regional culture in Overijssel’.
An action plan was drawn up for the implementation of the regional culture policies
contained in the 'Foreign food/New appetite' provincial cultural policy document.

The province of Overijssel’s current policy on regional languages is laid down in the 1995
policy document. This ‘delegated’ the provincial policy on the protection and promotion of
regional languages to the IJssel Academy in Kampen and the Van Deinse Institute in
Enschede. In 1998 each of these institutions appointed a regional language consultant for a
three-year period. Since 1998, these consultants have done much to improve the position of
Sallands and Twents. In 2002, the provincial council has started to provide structural funding
for regional culture. This is mainly intended to finance the work of the regional language
consultants.
2.2 Article 7, paragraph 1.b
No measures of whatever nature have been taken to devise territorial divisions so as to render
the use or survival of the Low Saxon languages more difficult. Dutch policy thereby accords
with Article 7, paragraph 1.b. 450
2.3 Article 7, paragraph 1.c
This paragraph requires the authorities to act resolutely to protect Low Saxon as a regional
language. The committee of experts is of the opinion that central government could do more
for the provinces and municipalities concerned. It is also of the opinion that Low Saxon
speakers in Gelderland receive proportionately less assistance than those in the other
provinces. 451
On 9 May 2000, the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations consulted with
representatives of provinces and municipalities in the northeast of the Netherlands. While
praising various initiatives on behalf of Low Saxon, the State Secretary and the provinces
noted that local and provincial policy will have to be intensified in some cases if the tiers of
government concerned are to meet their obligations under Part II of the Charter. The current
report shows that this conclusion has been taken to heart. The following steps have been
taken to promote and safegua rd Low Saxon languages:
2.3.1

Province of Drenthe

Structural subsidies have been given to the following facilities:
Drentse Taol, centrum veur Taol en Letterkunde

The Drenthe regional language institute is active in the following fields:
1. language promotion (including Drents courses and a telephone language
service),
2. literature,
3. Drents in schools and
4. language studies.

Roet

Drents literary periodical. Bilingual
Annual provincial subsidy: €2,800.
Oeze Volk

A popular Drents monthly.
Annual provincial subsidy: €18,000.
Subsidy scheme for Drents publications

This seeks to promote the publication of literary and historical works. Recent years
have seen the publication of many high-quality literary works in Drents thanks to
funding from this source. The scheme’s annual budget is €11,500.
Subsidy for activities in the field of art and culture

This budget is generally used to fund one-off events such as Drents writing
competitions, a Drents drama evening, research on Low Saxon (see section 1.3),
cross-regional Low Saxon language gathering in Hoogeveen, etc. The funds are
largely intended for new activities. The annual budget is €68,000. Drents language
projects account for 10 to 20% of spending.
Drents spelling

Promotes the quality and accessibility of written Drents. Authorised by the provincial
council in 1987. A spelling committee is now reviewing the current authorised
spelling.
2.3.2

Province of Fryslân (municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf)

Structural subsidies have been awarded by the provincial authorities/local authorities of
Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf to the following facilities:
Stellingwarver Schrieversronte

Its activities include:
Stellingwerfs language courses;
Stellingwerfs as part of regional culture;
a documentation centre with collections relating to the language, literature,
history and culture of the people of the Stellingwerf region;
Stellingwerf literary ball;
a 'sutelaktie' project on books in Stellingwerfs;
publicity and information;
development activities.
The Cultural Activities Scheme
This seeks to promote the publication of books in Stellingwerfs
Linguistic research into Stellingwerfs (project 1999-2002)
Provincial scheme to promote use of the Frisian language
The scheme’s annual budget is €68,067 for projects
Since 11 June 1997 this scheme has been extended to the local languages, including
Stellingwerfs and Bildts
Additional subsidies
Contribution to SONT for research into recognition of Low Saxon
From 2000 to 2002 funding totalled approximately €530,000 for both structural and
occasional projects. This amount has been divided evenly among the province of Fryslân, the
municipality of Ooststellingwerf and the municipality of Weststellingwerf.
The manicipal executives of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf have decided to intensify
language policy substantially up to 2007. This intensification, along with the activities of the

187

regional language officer in 2001 and 2002 (see section 2.1.2), is being included in a ma ster
plan for an integrated "new policy on the Stellingswerfs dialect".
The planned intensification of this policy will include action to ensure the integrated
introduction of Stellingwerfs into relevant fields covered by the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages.
The planned timetable is as follows:
- a general preparatory phase (2003)
- introduction of Stellingwerfs in the work of local authorities and associated public
services (2004)
- further introduction and integration in education (2005)
- further introduction in the media (2006)
- further introduction in cultural activities and facilities and in social and economic life
(2007).
2.3.3 Province of Gelderland
Achterhoek and Liemers

-

-

-

-

In order to support research into and awareness of the unique local heritage of the
Achterhoek and Liemers, the Staring Institute receives an annual provincial subsidy, a
subsidy from the municipality of Doetinchem and an allowance per inhabitant of most
other municipalities in the Achterhoek and Liemers.
Since 1993 the province of Gelderland has given an annual subsidy to the Staring
Institute’s WALD project, which seeks to produce a dictionary of the Achterhoek and
Liemers dialects. Six volumes of the systematic Dictionary of the Achterhoek and
Liemers Dialects (WALD) have now been published, the last of them in 2001. The
postal survey on which this systematic dictionary is based ended in 2002. Work on
publishing the results is still continuing and the next volume is due to appear in 2003.
The provincial subsidy for this project totals €4,265 a year (not including indexation).
In May, the Staring Institute is to commence the survey work for a follow-up research
project on the grammar of Achterhoek and Liemers. The project will be headed by Dr
J.B. Berns. No subsidy applications have yet been submitted.
The province is providing an annual subsidy of €23,333 (not including indexation)
towards the cost of employing the regional language consultant appointed at the
Staring Institute on 15 February 2002. This means that Achterhoek and Liemers now
have an officer whose job it is to draw attention to the value of the local dialect. The
regional language consultant will focus his activities on primary schools.

Veluwe
Since 1 April 2002, the province has been subsidising (€74,420) a large-scale research
project on the dialects of the Veluwe and the Gelderse Rivierengebied (the southern
part of the province watered by the Rhine, Waal and Maas rivers). On that date,
researchers at the University of Nijmegen began work on a (systematically structured)
dictionary of the dialects spoken in the Veluwe and Rivierengebied. The aim of the
research is to record dialect in a manner similar to that employed since 1980 in the
Achterhoek and Liemers by the Staring Institute and since 1998 in Overijssel by the
IJssel Academy (in each case in the context of the dialect dictionaries for those areas).
This project has been launched by the following institutions: University of Nijmegen,
Gelders Oudheidkundig Contact (GOC: an umbrella organisation for museums, local
history societies, regional language associations etc. in Gelderland), the IJssel
Academy and the Staring Institute.The research project is concerned with both the

188

Low Saxon dialects of the Veluwe and the Dutch- language dialects spoken in the
Gelderse Rivierengebied not belonging to the Low Saxon linguistic region.
2.3.4 Province of Groningen

The Province of Groningen gives an annual subsidy to:
• Groninger Language and Culture Office
• Stichting Grunninger Taal
• Stichting Kostverloren
• Provenciale Schriefwestried (provincial writing contest)

€ 90,756
€ 15,882
€ 5,672
€
681

By the summer of 2002, the provincial council is due to decide whether or not to award a
proposed €200,000 increase in the budget for the Gronings variety of Low Saxon.
2.3.5 Province of Overijssel

By subsidising regional language consultants at the IJssel Academy and the Van Deinse
Institute (the two institutes of regional culture in the province), Overijssel seeks to contribute
to the preservation of the Sallands and Twents varieties of Low Saxon. As part of their task,
these consultants spend a day or so per week working on the Cross-border Regional
Language Project (GOS). The activities of the regional language consultants are discussed
below (cf. section 2.4.5).
•
•

The Province of Overijssel awards an annual subsidy to
the two regional culture institutes (IJssel Academy in
Kampen and Van Deinse Institute in Enschede).
In 2000 and 2001, the province subsidised the regional
language consultants to the tune of €95,500 per year.
From 2002 on, the work of the language consultants will
be supported by a structural provincial subsidy of
€100,000.

2.4 Article 7, paragraph 1.d
In cultural activities and at cultural events, there is a growing tendency to use the Low Saxon
languages in speech and in writing. The publicly- funded provincial and local broadcasting
companies regularly use Low Saxon in programmes about regional culture. The length of

189

such programmes varies from one to five hours a week. The use of Low Saxon in newspapers
and magazines largely depends on whether or not the publications in question have a cultural
section and how often it appears, and therefore the frequency varies from once/twice a week
to once a fortnight. Low Saxon in newspapers is mainly used in prose, poetry and reflective
texts about regional culture.
About 50 books are published annually in one of the variants of Low Saxon. CDs are also
produced of songs and texts in Low Saxon. In Groningen 10 CDs are launched each year and
in Gelderland editions of 3,000 are not unusual. In addition, there is a great variety of
amateur cabaret, revue and theatre in the Low Saxon languages. On cultural occasions, Low
Saxon is incidentally used by local and provincial authorities. Some municipalities in Drenthe
and Overijssel offer to solemnise marriages in Drents and Twents. A similar practice exists in
the municipality of Ooststellingwerf for marriages in Stellingwerfs.
The committee of experts rightly notes that there is no all-embracing government policy on
Low Saxon. 452 This is partly because the emphasis and intensity of policy varies from one
province or municipality to another, depending on the situation of each Low Saxon dialect.
The local and provincial governments, which have an intimate knowledge of the needs in this
area, can thus deliver tailored solutions with scope for intensifying policy, as became evident
during a conversation between the State Secretary for the Interior and Kingdom Relations and
provincial and municipal representatives in the northeast of the Netherlands on 9 May 2000.
Since then, the provinces have developed many activities.
The following steps have been taken to stimulate the use of Low Saxon languages, in speech
and writing, and in public and private life:
2.4.1

-

-

-

Province of Drenthe

The local language institutes which are subsidised by the Province of Drenthe play a
major role in encouraging the use of Low Saxon in public and private life. Their work
would not be possible without the subsidies they receive from the province.
The advisory report on the future of Drents which appeared in 2001 was written on the
initiative of the province. Based on it, the provincial council has appointed a new board of
governors for the Drentse Taol organisation (whose staff costs are met by the province)
and the local language institute has been relaunched as a new not- for-profit organisation.
The province acts as a facilitator in relation to the annual Drents Dictation Competition,
which is held in the Provincial States assembly room.
In 2001, Queen's Commissioner Mr. A.L. ter Beek chaired the cross-regional Low Saxon
language gathering in Hoogeveen.
Radio TV Drenthe broadcasts part of its programmes in Drents.

Some subsidised projects:
- the literary café 2002-2003 in Amen (bilingual)
- dinners with readings (Het Drentse Boek)
- writing competition (Het Drentse Boek)
- Dutch index to Drents dialects dictionary in 2000

2.4.2

Province of Fryslân (municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf)

The municipalities have decided to use the Stellingwerfs names for local bodies of water in
their official business. These decisions were taken by the municipal council of
Ooststellingwerf on 17 April 2001 and the municipal executive of Weststellingwerf on 27
March 2002.
The municipalities of Oost- and Weststellingwerf have decided that work should continue on
the development of a new local language policy document entitled 'New language policy for
Stellingwerf(s)'.
The municipalities have decided to increase the number of literary prizes from two to three.
The municipality of Ooststellingwerf is explicitly encouraging the use of texts in
Stellingwerfs on vehicles used by the refuse department.
The mayor of Weststellingwerf speaks Stellingwerfs when appropriate.
2.4.3

Province of Gelderland

The promotion of Low Saxon languages is an important aim as far as the Staring Institute and
the foundations and associations listed under Gelderland (see Annexe I) are concerned.
New initiatives relating to Low Saxon languages have been launched in this period in
Gelderland (cf. subsection 2.3.3).
2.4.4

Province of Groningen

Numerous language-related activities have been organised by the Stichting Grunninger Toal
and Stichting Kostverloren. In addition, an annual provincial local language writing
competition has been launched and activities are being organised in the context of the four
regional cultural plans (cf. subsections 2.3.4 and 2.5.4).
2.4.5

Province of Overijssel

The IJssel Academy in Kampen and the Van Deinse Institute in Enschede play a major role in
the implementation of provincial policies on regional culture. Both institutions provide
support for the implementation of a range of projects designed to ensure the survival of
regional culture in the Province of Overijssel. In addition, since 1998 each of the institutions
has employed a regional language consultant. These posts are funded by the Province of
Overijssel and help to meet local needs in Overijssel in relation to the regional language
(Sallands and Twents). The two consultants undertake numerous activities designed to ensure
the survival of the regional language and to improve its status. Their efforts have created
increased interest in and appreciation of Sallands and Twents. The IJssel Academy is a
publisher as well as a knowledge centre.
The two regional culture institutes undertake innumerable activities involving the use of Low
Saxon in spoken and/or written form. These include publishing a volume of winning entries
to a regional language writing competition, Noaber in Salland, the pub lication of Jip and
Janneke (favourite Dutch story books for small children) in Twents, the translation of (parts
of) the Bible into Twents, the organisation of language courses and programmes on regional
television (e.g. Kiek’n waj zegt, Aksent, studio Oost, all on RTV-Oost).

191

As part of their task, the above consultants spend a day or so per week working on the Crossborder Regional Language Project (GOS). The GOS project aims to carry out research into
regional languages and to produce thematic dictionaries and grammars.
In addition, the IJssel Academy is carrying out its own grammar project, for which purpose it
employs its own project leader for a day or so a week.
The Overijssel member of the Provincial Executive Kristen speaks Low Saxon whenever
appropriate.
2.5 Article 7, paragraph 1.e
Cooperation between regional and local language institutions involved in the promotion of
the variants of the Low Saxon in the northeastern part of the Netherlands has been
encouraged in various ways. Most contacts between the organisations in the Low Saxon
linguistic region are cultural in nature. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7,
paragraph 1.e. 453
2.5.1

Province of Drenthe

The Province of Drenthe’s 1997 policy document on regional culture and literature contains
the following objective: RC23 - "Now that Low Saxon has been recognised as a European
language, awareness of being part of a larger linguistic region has grown among the various
local linguistic regions. There is greater scope than before for cooperative ventures in the
field of language and literature within the linguistic region. In instances where this can be of
demonstrable added value for Drents we shall encourage cooperative ventures in the field of
language and literature. We shall ask SONT if it can play a larger role in such activities than
hitherto. We shall also research, in close consultation with partner authorities in the Low
Saxon linguistic region, whether it would be sensible to allocate a separate budget to such
activities. We shall also consider the question of whether the SONT board should in future
play a more important role, providing advice and recommendations on Low Saxon."
Various actions were carried out over the past year:
- One aim of the cross-regional Low Saxon language gathering in Hoogeveen (2001) was
to encourage networking between speakers of different variants of Low Saxon in the
Netherlands.
- The province supports SONT, the Federation of local and regional language organisations
in the Low Saxon linguistic region. Cooperation under the SONT umbrella extends to
every field of language use: language promotion, literature, government and
administration, education, the courts, the church, the media and academic life. The
emphasis is on cooperation and mutual information transfer in the education field.
- Within Drenthe, action has been taken to promote cooperation between regional language
institutions, in particular between Drentse Taol and Het Drentse Boek. The two
institutions now work together on the publication of the Taolkraant, a Drents language
magazine.

Province of Gelderland

The province supports SONT.
A number of organisations work together, particularly in Gelderland and Overijssel.
- The GOS foundation, i.e. the Cross-border regional language project foundation, is a
platform in which the Staring Institute, the IJssel Academy and the Van Deinse Institute
work with the Landeskundliches Institut Westmünsterland in Vreden (Germany).
- The Union of Lo w Saxon Dialect Circles is a platform that has existed for a great many
years between the Dialectkringe Salland en Oost-Veluwe, the Kreenk vuur de Twentse
Sproak, the Dialectkringe Achterhook en Liemers and the Vereniging van de Streektaal
voor Lochem en Omgeving.
- Dr A.H.G. Schaars, employed by the Staring Institute, is a member of various SONT
working groups: the European recognition working group, the working group on spelling
(which seeks to establish a Low Saxon spelling) and the media working group (which
carries out small-scale studies in its field). He is also a member of the editorial board
preparing a Low Saxon Handbook. Here, cooperation is not just cultural but academic.
- Dr Schaars represents the Staring Institute on the project steering committee for the
Dictionary of Gelders dialects (WGD); the other members are: Professor R. van Hout
(representing the University of Nijmegen), Mrs. P. Bloemhoff-de Bruijn (representing the
IJssel Academy) and Mr. B. van Straalen (representing the GOC).

Province of Groningen

The province supports the following activities and bodies
- SONT Federation
- SONT’s Working Group for European Recognition of Low Saxon
- regional and culture plans: cooperation between the province and the Groninger
municipalities. The plans provide for cooperation not only in the amateur arts field, but
also in the fields of language and culture.
2.5.5

Province of Overijssel

The Province of Overijssel has asked the two regional culture institutes to draw up a joint
programme of activities fo r the regional language consultants. The consultants are to work in
concert wherever possible. The Van Deinse Institute is based in Twente, the IJssel Academy
in Kampen.
The province supports SONT. In addition, Overijssel is also taking the lead in the process of
giving further recognition to Low Saxon.

193

2.6 Article 7, paragraph 1.f
Depending on the situation of each individual Low Saxon language, schools can make
provisions for the teaching of a variant of Low Saxon. Since 1937, the Primary Education Act
has contained a provision that living regional languages may be used as mediums of
instruction in schools. Only the Stellingwerf variety of Low Saxon has been made a regular
part of the primary school curriculum in the municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and
Weststellingwerf. In the other areas Low Saxon merely receives incidental attention. This
also applies to secondary education in the Low Saxon linguistic region as a whole. Language
courses are organised by regional institutes. At university level the language can be studied at
the University of Groningen. Occasionally language courses are offered to teachers in
primary education. The committee of experts urges the development of a more coherent
strategy for the study of Low Saxon and education in it. 454 Several provinces have responded
to this suggestion. More details are given below.
2.6.1

-

Province of Drenthe

Drentse Taol is working with primary and secondary education to update the regular
attention paid to Drents in the schools.
At the request of individual schools, Drentse Taol runs parents' evenings about Drents and
bilingualism.
The Drenthe college of higher professional education provides a module on the Drents
language as an option in the training courses for future primary school teachers.
A modest selection of literary works in Drents is part of the reading list in the senior
classes of secondary schools.

2.6.2 Province of Fryslân (municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf)
Preschool education and playgroups

Preparatory work has been done on a project called "Ukkespeulplak" ('Kindergarten'), the aim
of which will be to ensure systematic use of Stellingwerfs in pre-school provision
Primary education
Stellingwerfs has been made a regular part of the primary school curriculum, in accordance
with the findings of the 1995 Education Inspectorate report “Frisian in the study of local
history and environmental studies”. For the period 1997-1999 the municipalities of
Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf made funds available for the production of learning
materials on and in the Stellingwerfs language for the teaching of local studies at primary
schools in the two municipalities. The project has been entrusted to the Stellingwerver
Schrieversronte.
- All primary schools in Weststellingwerf (27) have been exempted from the statutory
requirement to teach Frisian as a subject, and teach local studies in its place in accordance
with the findings of the above-mentioned Education Inspectorate report. Local studies
covers history, languages (Frisian and Stellingwerfs), country and people, society, nature
and art. It is part of the school plan in primary education. Language teaching is structured
differently in each school, and there are differences in levels of comprehension, oral and
written skills.
- In Ooststellingwerf the situation is different. Here all public-authority primary schools in
(15) have been exempted from the requirement to teach Frisian as a subject. They teach
local studies in its place. Seven publicly- funded Protestant primary schools, two of which
are in Oosterwolde, are not exempted, and teach Frisian as a subject instead of local
studies.

The Frisian youth magazine, developed by GCO fryslân for use in the top classes of primary
schools, also appears in a Stellingwerfs edition (circulation 2300). A quarterly bulletin is
written for the infant and junior classes:
- ‘t Herenhoentien (circulation 2500)
- Uut de buse (circulation 2300)
- Switsj (circulation 2300).
The Stellingwerver Schrieversronte provides a Stellingwerfs language course for primary
school teachers. In 1996 over 40 people attended the course.
Secondary education

A secondary school in Oosterwolde (Stellingwerf College) provides regional language classes
as an option.

Province of Gelderland

At the request of third parties (including schools) the Staring Institute provides assistance. It
also provides writing and spelling courses at antiquarian societies, village halls and
Doetinchem Adult Education Centre.
As a result of the appointment of the regional language consultant in February 2002, the
Staring Institute will now be able to play a more active part in bringing the local language to
the attention of primary and other schools of Achterhoek and Liemers districts.
2.6.4

Province of Groningen

Schools in the province of Groningen make limited use of Low Saxon. It is not known
exactly which schools offer activities in Low Saxon. However, most primary and secondary
schools take part in an annual writing competition in the Gronings variety of Low Saxon.
2.6.5

Province of Overijssel

Schools in Overijssel make regular use of the services of both institutes of regional culture.
Salland (West Overijssel)

-

The IJssel Academy develops educational support programmes, which are then delivered
and supervised at primary school level by the regional language consultant. The IJssel
Academy also holds courses in regional language and culture.

Twente (East Overijssel)

-

The Van Deinse Institute has adapted the “Jewilmke” teaching pack (6 dialect lessons and
2 history lessons) for the dialect and history of Glanerbrug and launched it in the primary
schools. Lessons have also been made for Weerselo and Vroomshoop/Daarleveen.
Throughout Twente, there is a demand for "separate" lessons (i.e. not part of a package).

2.7. Article 7, paragraph 1.g
Facilities to enable interested non-speakers of Low Saxon to learn the language if they so
desire are found in several places. These facilities are run by organisations subsidised by
provinces and municipalities. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph 1.g. 455
The various facilities are listed below:
2.7.1

A Stellingwerfs language course is organised annually by the Stellingwarver
Schrieversronte. The course takes some three months to complete and culminates in an
examination. The subsidy for the course is part of a standing agreement between the
municipalities and the Stellingwarver Schrieversronte.
A Dutch-language course booklet entitled ‘How do you spell Stellingwerfs?’ has been
published. It was written by Dr H. Bloemhoff and subsidised by the province of Fryslân.

The Staring Institute provides writing and spelling courses at antiquarian societies, village
halls and Doetinchem Adult Education Centre. A number of these are specifically geared
to interested non-speakers of the Achterhoeks variety of Low Saxon (Achterhoeks).
The Achterhoek and Liemers dialect associations and the Friends of the Local Language
of Lochem and District organise a wide range of meetings which are also open to people
who cannot speak Achterhoeks.
The Staring Institute cooperates with both these dialect associations on the organisation of
events which are also intended for people who cannot speak Achterhoeks; these include
an annual writing competition and the “Achterhoek and Liemers Book Week”.

2.7.4

-

Province of Fryslân (municipalities of Ooststellingwerf and Weststellingwerf)

Province of Groningen

Since 1998 Low Saxon courses (Gronings) have been developed for adult education in
north Groningen and the Veenkolonie area. These are now being elaborated for other
parts of the province. The local language officer develops the material, which is
disseminated via the Scheemda platform. Thus, the material is available to any body or
individual wanting to set up a course. A great deal of use is currently being made of it.

2.7.5

Province of Overijssel

Non-speakers of variants of Low Saxon can learn them through courses at the two regional
cultural institutes.
Salland (West Overijssel)

-

The special facilities on offer include a local language writing course produced by the
IJssel Academy. The spelling used by the institute has been published in brochure form.
The IJssel Academy is engaged in developing courses in the local language in the towns
of Kampen and Heino.

Twente (East Overijssel)

-

In Twente a standard spelling as devised by the Van Deinse Institute has been laid down
for Twents. The institute also promotes teaching in Twents at primary school level. The
Van Deinse Institute provides lessons together with the Kreenk vuur de Twentse Sproak.
Candidates have also been trained as teachers in the different varieties of the Low Saxon
language. The Van Deinse Institute regularly works with RTV Oost (the regional radio
and television station for Overijssel) and promotes the use and study of local languages
using a number of different angles.

2.8 Article 7, paragraph 1.h
By ratifying the Charter in 1996, the Netherlands underlined that opportunities for studying
and researching Low Saxon should be available at universities and similar institutions. The
Netherlands is thereby implementing Article 7, paragraph 1.h, as the committee of experts

196

noted in 2001. 456 Since then, the position of research into Low Saxon ha s been strengthened
at universities and research institutes in the Netherlands.
Groningen University has created a chair of Low Saxon, paid for out of the general university
budget. In 2001, the university also created a professorship in the language and culture of
Groningen, an appointment for one day per week, funded by the J.B. Scholten Fund,
provisionally for three years. The Low Saxon Institute at Groningen University plays an
important part in researching Low Saxon. It is also involved in the large-scale survey
mentioned in section 1.3. In September 2001, the University of Groningen awarded Mr H.
Nijkeuter a doctorate in the literary history of Drents. His thesis is a standard work entitled
"De pen gewijd aan Drenthe's dierbren grond". Literaire bedrijvigheid in de Olde Lantschap,
1816-1956.
Nijmegen University is playing a substantial part in recording the Low Saxon vocabulary of
the Veluwe (see 2.3.3 and 2.5.3).
The Meertens Institute in Amsterdam - one of the research institutes of the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences - is involved in the research and documentation of Dutch
language and culture. Its research includes dialectology, and covers all the dialects spoken in
the Netherlands as well as the variants of Low Saxon.
Research themes:
- dialect as an autonomous system (phonology, morphology, syntax);
- the relationship between dialect and standard language.
Dialectology research findings are published in books and in the journal Taal en Tongval.
2.9
Article 7, paragraph 1.i
By ratifying the European Charter in 1996, the Netherlands underlined that attention was
being focused on cross-border exchanges concerning Low Saxon. The Netherlands is thereby
implementing Article 7, paragraph 1.i, as the committee of experts noted in 2001. 457 The
current state of affairs is as follows.
SONT and the Stellingwarver Schrieversronte are represented in the Dutch Committee of the
European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages.

As part of their task, the above regional languages consultants in the province of Overijssel
spend a day or so per week working on the Cross-border Regional Language Project (GOS).
The GOS foundation is a platform in which the Staring Institute, the IJssel Academy and the
Van Deinse Institute work with the Landeskundliches Institut Westmünsterland in Vreden
(Germany). The GOS project aims to carry out research into regional languages and to
produce thematic dictionaries and grammars.
As part of the GOS project two GOS groups have been set up in Nordhorn and Schüttorf
(Germany). There has also been contact with the Euregio. This included the running of a
symposium workshop in cooperation with a cross-border library project in the Euregio
building and in Halteren.

Second report on Limburger language, Yiddish and
Roma and Sinti languages in the Netherlands (1999-20002001)
Responsible editor: Auke van der Goot
Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations
The Hague 2003

The Limburger language in the Netherlands
1

Introduction

1.1

Within the Netherlands, the Limburger language is spoken only in the province of
Limburg. There are three main variants, spoken respectively in north Limburg, central
and south Limburg, and the south-east of the province (the area around Heerlen,
Kerkrade and Vaals). 458 The Limburger language is spoken throughout the whole
province, though somewhat less commonly in the far north and north-west.

1.2

The province of Limburg has a population of around 1.1 million. It is thought that
approximately 70-75% of its residents can be regarded as “speakers”. In this context,
this means that they can understand or actively speak the Limburger language.
Research on the Limburger language is undertaken by the dialectology departments of
the universities of Nijmegen and Louvain and by the Veldeke Limburg association. In
1999, the latter published the results of a survey on the image of the Limburger
language.

1.3

There are various local bodies concerned with the protection and promotion of the
Limburger language. The best known is the Veldeke Limburg association, founded in
1926 (see address list). With 3500 members, this is the largest dialect association in
the Netherlands. Another noteworthy body is the DOL Association, which promotes
use of the Limburger language within education. In addition, a working group, known
as AGL, is trying to develop a standard written form of the Limburger language
which will take precedence over the various spoken dialects. For names and addresses
see appendix.

1.4

In 1996, the Netherlands approved the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages after the Lower House passed relevant legislation on 19 October 1995 and
the Upper House on 23 January 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1996, 136).

1.5

On 14 February 1997, following consultation with the province of Limburg, the Dutch
government took action to recognise the Limburger language as a regional language
within the meaning of the Charter. This decision means that the principles of Part II of
the Charter now apply to the Limburger language spoken in the Dutch province of
Limburg. The letter from the Ministry of the Interior & Kingdom Relations setting out
the decision dates from 20 February 1997 and was signed by Jacob Kohnstamm,
acting State Secretary for the Interior & Kingdom Relations.

Naamkunde en Veldeke Limburg, 1996.

203

1.6

On 19 March 1997, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands made a
supplementary declaration to the Council of Europe concerning the official
recognition of the Limburger language as a regional language within the meaning of
Article 2 (1) of the Charter. This action commits the Netherlands to applying the
principles of Part II of the Charter to the Limburger language (c.f. Treaty Series 1998,
20).

1.7

The text of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was concluded
on 5 November 1992 in English and French. The Government of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands has published both texts in Treaty Series 1993, 1, and a Dutch translation
in Treaty Series 1993, 199 (but see also Treaty Series 1998, 20 (C)).

1.8

When drafting this report, use was made of data provided by the province of Limburg.
It was drawn up and collected with the assistance of the provincial advisory body on
the Limburger language (Raod veur ‘t Limburgs) and the new regional language
officer. The reference date for this report is 1 May 2002.

1.9

Following the first information-gathering operation in 1999-2000, the committee of
experts (referred to in Article 16, paragraph 3, of the European Charter) visited the
Netherlands in February 2000 to gather information about civil-society organisations
promoting the Limburger language. In early 2001, the committee of experts set out its
findings and recommendations, based on the information gathered and a working
visit.

1.10

At its 765th meeting, on 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe took note of the committee of experts' report. The Committee of
Ministers has made certain recommendations, which are also relevant to the
Limburger language. 459 The report and the recommendations can be consulted on the
Council of Europe's local and regional democracy website: www.coe.int/local.

1.11

The Netherlands was advised to develop a national language policy encompassing the
Limburger language and the other languages protected under Part II of the European
Charter in accordance with the objectives and principles set out in Part II.

1.12

The Dutch government's policy consists of making local and regional authorities in
the province of Limburg primarily responsible for developing policy on the
Limburger language in accordance with the obligations entered into under the
European Charter. The emphasis and intensity of provincial policy will vary as the
needs of different localities vary. The provincial government, which has an intimate
knowledge of these needs, has developed various new initiatives on the Limburger
language since the committee of experts' visit. This report describes these initiatives
in more detail.

Application of Article 7

2.1 Article 7, paragraph 1.a
By recognising the Limburger language as a regional language within the meaning of the
Charter, the Dutch government wished to make clear that it regards it as an expression of the
cultural wealth of the Netherlands. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph
1.a, as the committee of experts noted. 460 Prime responsibility for policy- making on the
Limburger language lies with the local and provincial authorities in Limburg. The province of
Limburg has taken many steps in this area (see para 2.3).
2.2 Article 7, paragraph 1.b
No measures of any kind have been taken to modify the administrative divisions within the
province of Limburg in such as way as to constitute any obstacle to the continued existence
of the Limburger language. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph 1.b. 461
2.3 Article 7, paragraph 1.c
This paragraph requires governments to act resolutely to protect the Limburger language as a
regional language. The committee of experts is of the opinion that provincial policy will have
to be intensified if it was to meet the obligations under Part II of the Charter. 462 The current
report underlines that the province has taken this conclusion to heart. The province of
Limburg has taken the following steps to promote and safeguard the Limburger language:
• appointment of a regional language officer on 1 March 2001, entrusted with the task of
keeping alive the Limburger language in all its diversity, and of the above- mentioned
advisory body, the Raod veur 't Limburgs, to assist in this task. The regional language
officer was initially appointed on a parttime basis (0.4 FTE); since 1 July 2001 the
appointment has been fulltime
• on 15 March 2002 the Provincial Council approved the plan for 2001-2004 drawn up by
the Raod veur 't Limburgs and the regional language officer, thus accepting the policy set
out in section 6.2 of the plan concerning measures to determine whether language policy
complies with the provisions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages. The Raod veur 't Limburgs advises the Provincial Executive, which also
directs the regional language officer. By approving the plan, the provincial authorities
have also approved the projects in which the regional language officer is involved. These
are:
a. the creation of a website www.limburgsedialecten.nl, whose aim is to preserve the use
of Limburg dialects, especially by young people;
b. carrying out a wide-scale survey of people’s perceptions of speaking the Limburger
language and how perceptions and attitude are related to command of that language.
The questionnaire was designed by Rob Belemans of the University of Louvain;
c. designing a campaign for primary schools, mainly geared to attitude forming;
d. designing a campaign for secondary schools, mainly geared to attitude forming;
e. setting up a theatrical production for secondary schools in Limburg;
f. establishing standard spelling for the Limburger language, including a selection of
local variants;
g. holding a symposium (on 24 May 2002) on the preservation of the Limburger
language.

The regional language officer also has the task of monitoring developments relating to
the regional language in the Dutch province of Limburg and surrounding areas (including
Belgian Limburg) and, if necessary, to respond to such developments. Appendix 2
provides an overview of the budgets for the regional language officer’s projects for the
2001-2004 period;
incidental support for Veldeke Limburg, which in turn undertakes various activities (see
2.5)
subsidies for local dialect dictionaries
cooperation with the Belgian province of Limburg to subsidise the main dialect dictionary
(Woordenboek Limburgse dialecten)
incidental support for the Stichting DOL (Dialect Teaching Limburg)
support for incidental projects relating to the Limburger language, including the
publication of a number of books for young people.

2.4 Article 7, paragraph 1.d
Through the support described above (2.3), the province of Limburg is encouraging the use of
the Limburger language in speech and writing, in both public and private life. At executive
level this takes the form of Limburger-speaking members of the executive using the language
freely in the media and at meetings. The regional language officer always speaks and writes
in Limburger wherever the language is understood, and is willing to converse and correspond
in two languages (mostly Dutch-Limburger). Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7,
paragraph 1.d. 463
2.5 Article 7, paragraph 1.e
The province of Limburg promotes cooperation between speakers of the Limburger language,
amongst other things by subsidising the Veldeke Limburg and DOL associations. The former
comprises 11 local branches, which are in frequent contact with each other. The province
subsidises a series of literary works in dialect (Veldeke literair) covering all the linguistic
variants. Comic strips have also been translated to make the various characters speak variants
of the Limburger language. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph 1.e.
2.6 Article 7, paragraph 1.f
The committee of experts urges the development of a more coherent strategy for the study of
the Limburger language and education in it. 464 The province of Limburg has responded to this
suggestion by appointing a regional language officer and setting up an advisory Limburger
language board (see section 2.3). The current state of affairs is as follows.
Schools in Limburg are free to make arrangements for the use of the Limburger language in
the classroom. Ever since 1937 the legislation governing primary education in the
Netherlands has included provision for schools to use living regional languages as well as
standard Dutch as languages of communication wherever local conditions make it appropriate
to do so.

Veldeke Limburg is currently cooperating with the Dutch and Belgian provinces of
Limburg to establish a course on ‘the Limburger language in the classroom’ at primary
and secondary schools

the local branches of Veldeke Limburg are holding competitions to encourage recitals of
poetry or prose in dialect by children in primary school and the early years of secondary
education; they have the active support of teachers
authors are giving readings of their work in schools
in addition, there are various school courses, for example in local Maastricht dialect,
published by Veldeke’s kring Maastricht.

2.7 Article 7, paragraph 1.g
In a number of places in Limburg, there are facilities for non- native speakers to learn the
dialect if they so wish. For example, some of the branches of Veldeke Limburg provide
courses in speaking, reading and writing dialect. Advanced reading and writing courses have
been available since 2001. As noted in 2.6, work is also being done to establish a course on
‘the Limburger language in the classroom' for use in schools and this is also designed to help
non-native speakers. A mini-course in the Roermond dialect can be found on the website
www.limburgsedialecten.nl. Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph 1.g. 465
2.8 Article 7, paragraph 1.h
By declaring the European Charter applicable to the Limburger language in 1997, the
Netherlands accepted that opportunities for studying and researching the Limburger language
should be available at universities and similar institutions. The Netherlands is implementing
Article 7, paragraph 1.h, as the committee of experts noted in 2001. 466 Academic research on
the Limburger language is being conducted by the dialectology departments of the
universities of Nijmegen in the Netherlands and Louvain in Belgium.
2.9 Article 7, paragraph 1.i
By declaring the European Charter applicable to the Limburger language in 1997, the
Netherlands underlined that attention was being focused on cross-border contacts concerning
the Limburger language. The Netherlands is thereby implementing Article 7, paragraph 1.i, as
the committee of experts noted in 2001 467 . The current state of affairs is as follows.
There is extensive cooperation between the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg on
issues of regional language and culture. The private dialect associations are also heavily
involved in this.

Action includes:
• the appointment of two Belgian-Limburg members to the Raod veur ‘t Limburgs
• extensive cooperation between the Veldeke Limburg association and its Belgian
counterpart, the Limburg Dialect and Onomastics association
• a cross-border branch of Veldeke Limburg was established in 2001
• bringing in experts on the Limburger language in Belgium to advise various working
parties and committees within Veldeke Limburg
• attendance at special meetings of the Veldeke Limburg association by elected
representatives from both provinces in support of the goal of promoting and safeguarding
the dialect

Yiddish in the Netherlands
1. Introduction
1.1 There are thought to be a few hundred Yiddish-speakers in the Netherlands, most of them
in Amsterdam and a few in The Hague. In this context, Yiddish-speakers means people who
use Yiddish as the medium of domestic or scholarly communication. The figures relate
therefore to those with an active command of the language. It should be noted, however, that
they are not derived from surveys or other systematic research, but are based on estimates by
the Cheider in Amsterdam.
1.2 Various bodies are concerned with the preservation and promotion of Yiddish in the
Netherlands, most of them based in Amsterdam. These include the Cheider, the Jiddisjer
Kraiz and the Menasseh ben Israel Institute (see address list).
1.3 In 1996, the Netherlands approved the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages after the Lower House passed relevant legislation on 19 October 1995 and the
Upper House on 23 January 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1996, 136).
1.4 During the parliamentary proceedings on the bill on the acceptance of the Charter, the
Dutch government decided to recognise Yiddish as a non-territorial language within the
meaning of the Charter. This decision means that the principles of Part II of the Charter now
apply to the Yiddish spoken in the Netherlands, taking due account of the provisions of
Article 7, paragraph 5 of the Charter.
1.5 The text of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was concluded 5
November 1992 in English and French. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
has published both texts in Treaty Series 1993, 1, and a Dutch translation in Treaty Series
1993, 199 (but see also Treaty Series 1998, 20 (C)).
1.6 In drafting this report in 2000, the rapporteur drew on information provided by
Mr J.H. Sanders, Secretary of the Cheider, and Professor H.D. Meijering, Chairman of the
Menasseh ben Israel Institute. The report has been updated here and there at the request of the
Cheider. The reference date for this report is 1 October 2002.
1.7 Following the first information-gathering operation in 1999-2000, the committee of
experts (referred to in Article 16, paragraph 3, of the European Charter) visited the
Netherlands in February 2000 to gather information about civil-society organisations
concerned with the promotion and study of Yiddish. In early 2001, the committee of experts
set out its findings and recommendations, based on the information gathered and a working
visit.
1.8 At its 765th meeting, on 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the Council
of Europe took note of the committee of experts' report. The Committee of Ministers has
made certain recommendations, which are also relevant to Yiddish. 468 The report and the

recommendations can be consulted on the Council of Europe's local and regional democracy
website: www.coe.int/local.
1.9 The Netherlands was advised to develop a national language policy encompassing
Yiddish and the other languages protected under Part II of the European Charter in
accordance with the objectives and principles set out in Part II.
1.10 The Dutch government's policy consists of making civil- society organisations concerned
with preserving and studying Yiddish primarily responsible for expressing any wishes
concerning policy on the language, taking account of the obligations entered into under the
European Charter.
2 Application of Article 7
2.1 Article 7, paragraph 1.a
The Dutch government regards Yiddish as an expression of the cultural wealth of the
Netherlands.
2.2 Article 7, paragraph 1.b
This provision does not apply to non-territorial languages.
2.3 Article 7, paragraph 1.c
The following action has been/is being taken to promote and safeguard Yiddish:
in recent years
the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport and the municipality of Amsterdam have provided
funding for the annual Yiddish festivals
in 2000-2002
From 2000 to 2002, the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport carried out the following
activities aimed at protecting and preserving Yiddish, using money from the Second World
War Jewish Assets project:
development of a Yiddish course book and teaching materials for the Cheider in
Amsterdam (NLG 200,000)
research in archives and libraries concerning the Yiddish legacy of Dutch Jewry for
the Menasseh ben Israel Institute in Amsterdam (NLG 150,000).
Dutch policy thereby accords with Article 7, paragraph 1.c of the European Charter.
2.4 Article 7, paragraph 1.d
Through the support described above (para. 2.3), central government and the municipality of
Amsterdam are encouraging the use of Yiddish in speech and writing, in both public and
private life.
Prime responsibility for initiatives in this field lies with the private-sector organisations (see
address list), as the committee of experts noted in its report on the implementation of the
Charter in the Netherlands. 469 The organisations mentioned carried out the following
activities:
the Cheider uses Yiddish as a language of communication and instruction and, as
mentioned above, is working on the development of teaching materials
the Jiddisjer Kraiz promotes the speaking and reading of Eastern Yiddish
469

the Hachnoses-Orchim organisation is dedicated to the study of the history and
language of the East European Jews who emigrated to the Netherlands in the interwar years; its work is currently being supported out of funds available under the
project concerning redress for the looting of Jewish assets during World War II
the Stichting Hebreeuwse en Jiddische Woorden in het Nederlands is compiling a list
of Dutch words borrowed from Hebrew and Yiddish; this is now almost complete
the Menasseh ben Israel Institute is devoted to Jewish social and cultural studies;
some of its activities are mentioned in para. 2.3 (but see also para. 2.8)
the Stichting Jiddisj has the general aim of promoting Yiddish language, literature and
culture in the Netherlands; its activities are currently focused on the establishment and
maintenance of a substantial library of books in Yiddish acquired from the estate of
Yiddish specialist Mira Rafalowicz
Uitgeverij Vasallucci commissions and publishes a series of translations of literary
works in Yiddish; there are also other publishers which publish translations from
Yiddish.

2.5 Article 7, paragraph 1.e
The Cheider is an orthodox Jewish combined school which uses Yiddish alongside Dutch as a
language of communication and instruction. This makes the school a centre both for everyday
Yiddish and for Yiddish as a language of scholarship. The Cheider works with those
members of the Jewish community who, whether from background or persuasion, use
Yiddish as a language of communication in their private and scholastic lives.
2.6 Article 7, paragraph 1.f
The Council of Europe's committee of experts noted in 2000 that there was an orthodox
Jewish school in Amsterdam – the Cheider – where Yiddish was taught at both primary and
secondary level. 470 The Cheider also offers Yiddish- language childcare facilities. In the
traditional Jewish education which the Cheider offers, Yiddish is the language of
communication, even for those pupils who have not grown up speaking it in the home. The
immersion method is used to give them a rapid command of the language. New teaching
materials have now been introduced to teach non-Yiddish-speaking children in Yiddish.
2.7 Article 7, paragraph 1.g
In 2000, the Council of Europe's committee of experts noted that the University of
Amsterdam (UvA) was offering Yiddish courses. But these courses closed because they
failed to attract enough students. There are private institutes offering Yiddish courses, as the
committee noted. 471
The Cheider in Amsterdam gives all its pupils a knowledge of Yiddish, whether or not it is
their home language. Classical instruction is provided in the language for non-Yiddishspeakers. Until now, this has been done on a fairly informal basis, but the course
development project is now putting teaching on a more formal footing (the Ministry of
Health, Welfare and Sport helped fund the development of a Yiddish course book and
teaching materials – see para. 2.3)
There are also one or two basic courses in Yiddish elsewhere in the country for adult learners.

2.8 Article 7, paragraph 1.h
Innumerable studies relating to Yiddish are currently being conducted at Dutch universities
and research institutions. At university level, teaching and research relating to Yiddish were
undertaken until 1998 at both the universities in Amsterdam, but are now confined to only
one of them. Outside the universities, there is also extensive research on Yiddish, generally
undertaken in cooperation with the University of Amsterdam.
-

The University of Amsterdam has taught Yiddish since time immemorial. The
Menasseh ben Israel Institute's Yiddish project is to be managed by Dr Shlomo
Berger, a lecturer at that university.

-

Until 1998, Yiddish was also taught by the department of German studies at the Free
University of Amsterdam. The retirement of the relevant professor has put an end to
this activity, although a doctoral research project is still being conducted there
concerning changes in eighteenth-century Yiddish in the Netherlands.

-

The Mennaseh ben Israel Institute of Jewish social and cultural studies is based on a
collaborative venture between the two Amsterdam universities and the Jewish
Historical Museum in that city. The institute is currently housed within the Jewish
Historical Museum. One of its research projects concerns the documentary and other
legacy of the Ashkenazi Jewish community in the Netherlands, which used Yiddish
from the seventeenth century through to around 1900. The project involves
cooperation with the chair of Yiddish culture, language and literature at HeinrichHeine- universität in Düsseldorf. It is co- financed by the Netherlands Organisation for
Scientific Research (NWO).

-

At the International Institute of Social History, also in Amsterdam, Professor
R.G. Fuks-Mansfeld is conducting research on the Institute's own Yiddish collection
(mainly political documents, pamphlets etc.). The professor was previously attached
to the University of Amsterdam.

-

the research activities of the Hachnoses-Orchim organisation have already been
mentioned in para. 2.4.

2.9 Article 7, paragraph 1.i
Many exchanges take place with Yiddish-speakers in Jewish communities worldwide. In
practice, however, the majority of contacts are with Antwerp, London and Israel. They take
the following forms:
the Cheider organises exchange programmes for its pupils, with tests of their
knowledge of Jewish law in which Yiddish is the lingua franca
there are exchanges for teachers, enabling staff at the Cheider to acquaint themselves
with teaching methods and lesson themes developed in larger Yiddish-speaking
communities elsewhere
Yiddish-speaking adults have social, religious and intellectual contact with kindred
spirits in communities in other countries.
2.10 Article 7, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4
The measures and activities described above meet the obligations imposed by Article 7,
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

Roma and Sinti languages in the Netherlands
1 Introduction
1.1. Around 4500 people in the Netherlands can be classified as Sinti and approximately 750
people as Roma. The Sinti live mainly in the south, in the provinces of North Brabant and
Limburg, while the Roma are spread around the country. The Sinti speak a single language,
the Roma various dialects, depending on their origins. The National Organisation for Sinti in
the Netherlands estimates that 90% of the Sinti can speak their own language, whereas it is
not known how many Roma can speak Romani.
1.2 In 1996, the Netherlands approved the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages after the Lower House passed relevant legislation on 19 October 1995 and the
Upper House on 23 January 1996 (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 1996, 136).
1.3 In the bill on the adoption of the Charter, the Dutch government conveys that the Roma
and Sinti languages should be regarded as non-territorial languages within the meaning of the
Charter. This decision means that the principles of Part II of the Charter now apply to these
languages as spoken in the Netherlands, taking due account of the provisions of Article 7,
paragraph 5 of the Charter.
1.4 The text of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was concluded on 5
November 1992 in English and French. The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
has published both texts in Treaty Series 1993, 1, and a Dutch translation in Treaty Series
1993, 199 (but see also Treaty Series 1998, 20 (C)).
1.5
This report is based on information provided by the Ministry of the Interior &
Kingdom Relations and the Ministry of Health, Welfare & Sport in 2000. It has been updated
with the assistance of the National Organisation for Sinti in the Netherlands. The reference
date for this report is 1 October 2002.
1.6
Following the first information-gathering operation in 1999-2000, the committee of
experts referred to in Article 16, paragraph 3, of the European Charter visited the Netherlands
in February 2000 to gather information about civil-society organisations promoting the Roma
and Sinti languages. But representatives of speakers of these languages did not have the
opportunity to exchange thoughts with the committee of experts. 472
1.7
In its 765th meeting, on 19 September 2001, the Committee of Ministers of the
Council of Europe took note of the committee of experts' report. The Committee of Ministers
has made recommendations that are also relevant to the Roma and Sinti languages. The report
and the recommendations can be consulted on the Council of Europe's local and regional
democracy website: www.coe.int/local.
1.8
With regard to Romani and Sinti and the other languages protected under Part II of the
European Charter, the Netherlands was advised to develop a national language policy that
accords with the objectives and principles set out in Part II.

1.9
The Dutch government's policy consists of making Roma and Sinti civil-society
organisations primarily responsible for expressing any wishes concerning policy on their
languages, taking account of the obligations entered into under the European Charter.
2 Application of Article 7
2.1 Article 7, paragraph 1.a
With the ratification of the Cha rter in 1996, the Dutch government recognised that the Roma
and Sinti languages are expressions of the cultural wealth of the Netherlands.
2.2 Article 7, paragraph 1.b
This provision does not apply to non-territorial languages.
2.3 Article 7, paragraph 1.c
The government has in the past taken measures to promote and safeguard the Roma and Sinti
languages spoken in the Netherlands:
a grant has been provided for a schools video (partly in Sinti) to be devised in
cooperation between the National Organisation for Sinti in the Netherlands and the
Institut für Lehrerfortbildung (Pädagogik mit Roma und Sinti) in Hamburg (Germany)
a Roma-speaking advisor has been appointed to a primary school in Amsterdam
(South-East).
2.4 Article 7, paragraph 1.d
The government has done nothing to encourage the use of Roma and Sinti either in speech or
in writing, in either public or private life. The National Organisation for Sinti in the
Netherlands has given no indication of any problem in this area.
2.5 Article 7, paragraph 1.e
The government subsidises educational and promotional activities by the National
Organisation for Sinti in the Netherlands.
2.6 Article 7, paragraph 1.f
Schools in the Netherlands make no use whatever of the Roma or Sinti languages, other than
the aforementioned video (see 2.3).
2.7 Article 7, paragraph 1.g
No effort is being made by government to provide facilities for the teaching of these
languages to non-speakers either within the educational system or elsewhere. There is no
desire for this within the Sinti community.
2.8 Article 7, paragraph 1.h
No study or research is currently being undertaken at Dutch universities or equivalent
institutions in relation to the Roma and Sinti languages.
2.9 Article 7, paragraph 1.i
Government is doing nothing to encourage speakers of Roma and Sinti to maintain links with
speakers of these languages in other countries.

217

2.10 Article 7, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4
Taking due account of the situation of these languages in the Netherlands, the measures and
actions described above go as far as possible to meet the obligations imposed by Article 7,
paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.
