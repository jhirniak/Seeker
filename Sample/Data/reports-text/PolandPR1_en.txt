INTRODUCTION
After coming into force on 1 April 2001 with regard to the Republic of Poland the
Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities drawn up in Strasbourg on 1
February 1995 (Official Journal of 2002 No. 22, item 209), the ratification of the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, hereinafter referred to as “the Charter”, was
another stage of the actions aimed at binding the Republic of Poland with conventions
regulating the rights of people belonging to national minorities. Binding the Republic of
Poland with the Charter is also a confirmation, that minority languages and a regional
language are treated as a significant value in the Republic of Poland.
The present document is the first report on the situation of minority languages and a
regional language, prepared in accordance with Article 15 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages. The Report has been drawn up by the minister competent
for religious denominations and national and ethnic minorities, whom now is the Minister of
Interior and Administration. The said minister implements activities of the country connected
with protection, preservation and development of cultural identity of national and ethnic
minorities, including preservation and development of minority languages as well as
preservation and development of a regional language. During preparation of the document,
first of all there were described the measures aimed to promote the use of minority languages
and a regional language in public life, resulting from the provisions of part III of the Charter,
which were passed by the Republic of Poland during the process of ratification.
It should be pointed out that part III of the Report includes information on the actions
taken in order to implement the provisions contained in part III of the Charter with regard to
all minority languages and a regional language used in Poland. This results from the fact that
in the Declaration made by the Republic of Poland to the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages, Poland undertook to apply the foregoing provisions with regard to all
minority languages, defined in accordance with Article 3 (1) of the Charter. Therefore,
presentation of the above-mentioned information separately for each minority language and a
regional language would be an artificial effort.
Furthermore, due to the legal provisions and the solutions implemented in Poland
concerning minority languages and a regional language, information on implementation of
selected provisions of the Charter was presented together.

PART I: GENERAL
1.

The issue of implementation of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages into the Polish legal system.
With reference to the issue of implementation of the provisions of the European

Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by the Republic of Poland, there should be
indicated the status of the international law in the national legislation.
Pursuant to Article 87 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997
(Official Journal No. 78, item 483 with subsequent amendments), the sources of the
universally binding law of the Republic of Poland are: the Constitution, acts, ratified
international contracts, regulations, and within the area of the activities of the authorities
which enacted them, local legislation instruments.
Poland respects the basic rules of international law in accordance with the provisions
of the Charter of the United Nations and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, at the same being a party of the international contracts e.g. of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1963.
Article 91 of the Constitution provides that the ratified international contract, after its
publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Poland, is a part of the national legal
order and is directly applied, unless its application is contingent on the adoption of an act. The
international contract ratified after its prior approval included in the act, has priority over the
act, if the act cannot be reconciled with the contract. If the contract, ratified by the Republic
of Poland, establishing an international organisation so provides, the laws established by that
organisation shall be applied directly and have precedence in the event of a conflict of laws.
On 12 May 2003 the Republic of Poland signed the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages. The Charter concerns civic liberties, rights, obligations specified in the
Constitution and therefore, the consent to its ratification had to be given by way of the act. On
6 June 2005 the Council of Ministers adopted a decision on submitting the Charter for
ratification after the prior consent included in the act. The project of the act was a subject of
the works of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland. However, due to the end of the term of
office of the Sejm, the project was left without taking any further action. Therefore, the
Minister of Interior and Administration commenced the procedure connected with the
adoption of the project of the ratifying act for the second time. On 20 December 2006 the
project of the act was passed by circulation by the Council of Ministers, but it was not
referred for debate of the Sejm. In 2007 actions were taken aimed at completing the
ratification process of the Charter as quickly as possible. Works on drawing up this document
were finished in February 2008 and at that time there were documents submitted to the
7

Chancellery of the Prime Minister, concerning a petition for ratification of the European
Charter of Regional or Minority Languages, taking into consideration any previously
proposed legislative and editorial remarks. On 7 April 2008 the Council of Ministers passed a
decision on submitting the European Charter of Regional or Minority languages for
ratification after the prior consent included in the act. Next, the parliamentary works on the
project of the act concerning the ratification of the Charter were conducted.
Approval for the ratification of the Charter by the President of the Republic of Poland
was included in the Act of 13 June 2008 on the ratification of the European Charter of
Regional or Minority Languages, drawn up in Strasbourg on 5 November 1992 (Official
Journal of 2008 No. 144, item 898). On 12 February 2009 the Charter was ratified. Pursuant
to Article 19 (2) of the Charter, the document came into force in relation to Poland on 1 June
2009.
It should be emphasised that before the beginning of the ratification process of the
Charter, there had been consultations carried out with representatives of national and ethnic
organisations and communities using a regional language, concerning the choice of the
provisions which the Republic of Poland had undertaken to apply with regard to minority
languages and a regional language in Poland. The issue of choosing the foregoing provisions
was the subject of discussion of the Team on National Minorities during the 8th session, which
was held in June 2003. Moreover, in July 2003 the Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of
Interior and Administration turned to representatives of national and ethnic minorities as well
as communities using a regional language with a request to submit suggestions concerning
sections or points which, in accordance with Article 2 (2) of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, in their opinion should be provided in the declaration
included in the ratification document and also to indicate regional or minority languages
which according to Article 3 (1) of the Charter should be included in the ratification
document.
During the ratification of the Charter, the Republic of Poland declared that it was
going to use the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in accordance with
the provisions of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language (Official
Journal No. 17, item 141, with subsequent amendments). Poland undertook to apply these
provisions of the Charter which referred to the provisions binding in the Polish law. Thus,
there was no need to adjust the national law to the provisions of the Charter.

Territorial languages in the Republic of Poland

In the Republic of Poland, pursuant to Article 3 point 2 and in accordance with Article
19 (2) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and regional language, the regional or
minority languages are as follows: Byelorussian, Czech, Hebrew, Yiddish, Karaim,
Kashubian, Lithuanian, the Lemkos language, German, Armenian, Roma, Russian, Slovak,
the Tatar language and Ukrainian.
Information on the distribution of inhabitants using minority languages and a regional
language is given below:
The Byelorussian language
The Byelorussian language is used by people of the Byelorussian national minority,
who traditionally inhabit the south-eastern territories of Podlaskie Voivodship. During the
national census of people and dwellings carried out in 2002, 40 226 Polish citizens declared to
use the Byelorussian language in household relations, including in Podlaskie Voivodship –
39 622, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 226, Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodship – 90, Lubelskie
Voivodship – 72, Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 43, Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship – 39,
Pomorskie Voivodship – 35, Lubuskie Voivodship – 18, Podkarpackie and Małopolskie
Voivodships – 15, Łódzkie and Śląskie Voivodships – 13, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship –
11, Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 10, Opolskie and Świętokrzyskie Voivodships – 2.
The Czech language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002,
1 226 Polish citizens declared to use Czech language in household relations, including: in
Śląskie Voivodship – 239, Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 181, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 175,
Małopolskie Voivodship – 109, Podkarpackie Voivodship – 93, Łódzkie Voivodship – 77,
Opolskie and Wielkopolskie Voivodships – 67, Pomorskie Voivodship – 48, Lubelskie
Voivodship – 43, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship – 36, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 32,
Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodship – 23, Lubuskie Voivodship – 14, Podlaskie and
Zachodniopomorskie Voivodships – 11. The majority of people using the Czech language in
Poland do not declare to belong to the Czech minority. The first Czech migration to the
territories of Poland took place in the middle of the 16th century and was connected with
religious persecution of the Czech Brothers. Next migration waves were in the first half of the
17th century, the second half of the 18th century and at the beginning of the 19th century – the
last was connected with development of textile industry in Łódź. Currently the Czech
language plays a part of an indicator of the ethnic identity mainly in the town of Zelów
(Bełchatowski Poviat, Łódzkie Voivodship).

9

The Lithuanian language
The Lithuanian language is used by the people who belong to the Lithuanian national
minority who traditionally inhabit the northern territories of Podlaskie Voivodship. During the
national census of people and dwellings in 2002, 5 696 Polish citizens declared to use
Lithuanian language in household relations, including in Podlaskie Voivodship – 5 380,
Mazowieckie Voivodship – 88, Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodship – 44, Pomorskie
voivodship – 35, Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 34, Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 26, Śląskie and
Zachodniopomorskie Voivodships – 23, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 11, Małopolskie
Voivodship – 9, Łódzkie Voivodship – 8, Lubuskie and Opolskie Voivodships – 5, Lubelskie
Voivodship – 3, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship – 2.
The Lemkos Language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, 5
605 Polish citizens declared to use the Lemkos language in household relations, including: in
Dolnośląskie Voivodship - 2 914, Małopolskie Voivodship - 1 780, Lubuskie Voivodship 682, Podkarpackie Voivodship - 131, Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship – 25, Wielkopolskie
Voivodship – 17, Pomorskie and Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodships – 11, Kujawskopomorskie Voivodship – 10, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 9, Lubelskie and Śląskie
Voivodships - 6, Łódzkie Voivodship – 2, Podlaskie Voivodship - 1. The Lemkos language is
used by people who declare to belong to the Lemkos minority. Traditionally, members of this
minority inhabited the region called Łemkowszczyzna [Lemkos Region] i.e. Beskid Niski and
part of Beskid Sądecki. In 1947 as a result of the Operation Vistula (condemned by the Senate
of the Republic of Poland in 1990) they were resettled to the territories of the current place of
living (the western voivodships of Poland). Now only a part of Lemkos live on the territories
of the historical Łemkowszczyzna [Lemkos Region] (Małopolskie Voivodship).
Some Lemkos emphasise their Ukrainian national status, others declare that they have
nothing in common with this nation.
The German language
The German language is mainly used by the people who declare to belong to the
German minority – the most numerous national minority inhabiting Poland. During the
national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, 196 841 Polish
citizens declared to use the German language in household relations, including: in Opolskie
Voivodship – 86 311, Śląskie Voivodship - 46 277, Pomorskie Voivodship -

11 594,

Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 10 381, Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 6 195, Warmińskomazurskie Voivodship – 6 049, Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship – 5 581, Kujawskopomorskie Voivodship – 5 284, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 4 696, Małopolskie Voivodship –
10

3 851, Lubuskie Voivodship – 3 455, Łódzkie Voivodship – 2 258, Podkarpackie Voivodship
– 1 585, Lubelskie Voivodship – 1 506, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship – 979, Podlaskie
Voivodship – 839.
The Russian language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, 12
125 Polish citizens declared to use the Russian language in household relations, including: in
Mazowieckie Voivodship – 2 183, Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 1 263, Śląskie Voivodship – 1
198, Podlaskie Voivodship – 1 121, Pomorskie Voivodship – 818, Wielkopolskie Voivodship
- 754, Łódzkie Voivodship – 668, Małopolskie Voivodship – 624, Zachodniopomorskie
Voivodship - 618, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 564, Warmińsko-mazurskie
Voivodship – 483, Podkarpackie Voivodship – 445, Lubuskie Voivodship - 436, Lubelskie
Voivodship – 435, Opolskie Voivodship – 261, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship – 254.
The majority of people who use the Russian language do not declare to belong to the Russian
national minority. The Russian people who live in Poland come mainly from the following
migration waves, within which they arrived in Poland: in the period of partitions of Poland,
after the October Revolution, in the period of the Polish People’s Republic and after the
Soviet Union’s dissolution. Moreover, in Podlaskie and Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodships
live the Old Believers (Starovery). This group as a religious community was formed in the
second half of the 17th century as a result of the split in the Russian Orthodox Church. At the
end of the 18th century the Old Believers (Starovery) settled in the current territories of Poland
(Suwalszczyzna [Suwałki Region] and Mazury), fleeing religious persecution. The most
important factor of identification of this group is religion (the Orthodox Church according to
the rites of the Eastern Church of Old Believers, which does not have the clerical hierarchy).
The Slovak language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002,
794 Polish citizens declared to use the Slovak language in household relations, including: in
Małopolskie Voivodship - 521, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 55, Śląskie Voivodship – 48,
Podkarpackie Voivodship – 38, Dolnośląskie Voivodship – 21, Opolskie Voivodship – 16,
Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 14, Łódzkie Voivodship – 13, Lubelskie Voivodship, Pomorskie
and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodships – 12, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship – 11, Warmińskomazurskie Voivodship – 7, Kujawsko-pomorskie and Lubuskie Voivodships – 5, Podlaskie
Voivodship – 4.
The Tatar language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002,
9 Polish citizens declared to use the Tatar language in household relations, including: in
11

Łódzkie Voivodship – 4, Lubelskie and Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodships – 2, Kujawskopomorskie Voivodship – 1, whereas 447 Polish citizens declared to belong to the Tatar ethnic
minority, including: in Podlaskie Voivodship - 319, Pomorskie Voivodship - 28,
Mazowieckie Voivodship - 22, Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 20, Dolnośląskie Voivodship 10, Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship – 9, Podkarpackie Voivodship – 8, Lubuskie and
Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodships – 6, Łódzkie Voivodship – 5, Śląskie Voivodship – 4,
Kujawsko-pomorskie and Małopolskie Voivodships – 3, Lubelskie and Świętokrzyskie
Voivodships - 1. Tatars inhabit the indigenous Tatar colonies in Białostocczyzna [Białystok
Region] (Bohoniki and Kruszyniany) and the following towns: Białystok, Sokółka, Dąbrowa
Białostocka and Gdańsk.
Polish Tatars lived on the territories of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the end of
the 14th century. Their ancestors were emigrants or fugitives from the lands of the time the
Golden Horde and Crimea. Tatars in Poland lost knowledge of their native language, but they
remained faithful to Muslim religion. The Muslim Religious Association in the Republic of
Poland plays a significant part in the life of the Tatar minority.
The Ukrainian language
The Ukrainian language is used by the people who declare to belong to the Ukrainian
national minority. During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out
in 2002, 21 055 Polish citizens declared to use the Ukrainian language in household relations,
including: in Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodship – 9 275, Podkarpackie Voivodship – 2 606,
Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship – 2 407, Pomorskie Voivodship – 2 048, Podlaskie
Voivodship - 1 414, Dolnośląskie Voivodship - 1 142, Mazowieckie Voivodship - 443,
Lubuskie Voivodship - 429, Lubelskie Voivodship - 359, Małopolskie Voivodship - 344,
Śląskie Voivodship – 222, Wielkopolskie Voivodship – 133, Opolskie Voivodship – 90,
Łódzkie Voivodship - 63, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 43, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship
– 37. Due to the Operation Vistula which was carried out in 1947 by, at that time, the
communist authorities, almost all Ukrainians inhabiting the territories of south-eastern Poland
were resettled to the lands of northern and western Poland. As a result, the biggest centres of
the Ukrainian minority are currently on the territories of the following voivodships:
Warmińsko-mazurskie, Dolnośląskie and Zachodniopomorskie. Some Ukrainians managed to
avoid the resettlement from the native lands and some were allowed to return after 1956.
Therefore, centres of the Ukrainian minority can be found in Podkarpackie and Małopolskie
Voivodships.

12

The Kashubian language
Kashubian is the most common language used in household relations. According to
the data of the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, 52 665
people use the Kashubian language, including: in Pomorskie Voivodship - 52 588. The
biggest centres of people using a regional language in household contacts are in the following
poviats of Pomorskie Voivodship: Kartuski (27,57 % residents of the poviat), Pucki (15,43
%), Wejherowski (5,13 %) and Bytowski (2,50 %). On the territory of 10 communes of
Pomorskie Voivodship people who use a regional language in household contacts account for
over 20% of the residents of the commune.

In the declaration which was submitted to the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages by the Republic of Poland it was indicated, that as the non-territorial
languages Poland regards the Hebrew language, Yiddish, Karaim, Armenian and the Roma
language. Information on people using the foregoing languages was provided in point 4.

3.

The number of people using minority languages and a regional language.

Within the census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, there was
conducted a research on nationality and the language which is most often used in household
relations, including all people who were subject to the census. In accordance with Article 5 of
the Act of 2 December 1999 concerning the national census of people and dwellings in 2002
(Official Journal of 2000 No. 1, item 1, with subsequent amendments), the said research
included the following questions:
1) what is the nationality of the registered person
2) what is the most common language used at home
Poland is currently inhabited by representatives of 13 national and ethnic minorities
whose number, confirmed in the last census, amounts to 253 273 people. This accounts for
about 0,7% of all Polish citizens.
The number of people using minority languages and a regional language in household
contacts is as follows:

Non-territorial languages in the Republic of Poland.

The Karaim language
The Karaites are the least numerous ethnic minority in Poland. During the census of
people and dwellings carried out in 2002, 43 Polish citizens declared to belong to the Karaim
nationality. The majority of the Karaites live in Warszawa and in its vicinity, in Wrocław and
Trójmiasto. The first groups of the Karaites arrived from the Crimea in the 13th century and
settled on the lands of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (Łuck, Halicz, Lwów). At the turn of
the 13th and 14th century a big group of the Karaites was settled in Trakai near Vilnius. In the
19th century the Karaites appeared in Warszawa as tobacco merchants, civil servants and
students. After the 2nd World War they resettled to the current territories of Poland as a result
of repatriation from the Eastern borderlands of the Republic of Poland.
The native language of the Karaites is on the brink of extinction. However, they stand
out with their Karaim religion stemming from Judaism. The activities of the Karaim Religious
Association in the Republic of Poland and the Association of Polish Karaites play a
significant part in the life of the Karaim minority.
The Armenian language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002,
321 Polish citizens declared to use the Armenian language in household relations, including:
14

in Mazowieckie Voivodship - 68, Łódzkie Voivodship – 45, Śląskie Voivodship - 30,
Lubelskie and Wielkopolskie Voivodships - 23, Lubuskie Voivodship – 21, Warmińskomazurskie Voivodship – 17, Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 16, Podlaskie Voivodship –
14, Małopolskie

and Zachodniopomorskie Voivodships – 13, Dolnośląskie Voivodship,

Pomorskie and Świętokrzyskie Voivodships – 10, Opolskie Voivodship – 5, Podkarpackie
Voivodship - 3. The Armenian language is also used by people who do not declare to belong
to the Armenian minority. The Armenian colonies which occurred around the 11th century in
Kievan Rus (Lviv, Lutsk, Kamianets-Podilskyi) became part of Poland during the reign of the
Casimir the Great. In 1356 the colonies in Kamianets-Podilskyi and Lviv received the
confirmation of their autonomy and Lviv became the seat of the Armenian Bishop. After the
2nd World War the Polish Armenians from the former South-Eastern borderlands repatriated
themselves to the current territories of Poland. The biggest centres of the Polish Armenians
are in Warszawa, Poznań and Kraków. A significant centre of the Armenian minority is also
Gliwice.
The Roma language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002, 15
657 Polish citizens declared to use the Roma language in household relations, including: in
Małopolskie Voivodship – 2 176, Mazowieckie Voivodship – 1 552, Dolnośląskie
Voivodship - 1 499, Śląskie Voivodship - 1 485, Wielkopolskie Voivodship - 1 396, Łódzkie
Voivodship - 1 203, Opolskie Voivodship – 1 011, Podkarpackie Voivodship - 910,
Kujawsko-pomorskie Voivodship – 826, Lubelskie Voivodship – 813, Zachodniopomorskie
Voivodship - 768, Warmińsko-mazurskie Voivodship - 610, Podlaskie Voivodship - 392,
Lubuskie Voivodship - 381, Świętokrzyskie Voivodship - 373, Pomorskie Voivodship - 262.
The Roma language is also used by people who do not declare to belong to the Roma ethnic
minority. The Roma in Poland are members of four ethnic groups: the Polish Roma, the
Carpathian Roma (Bergitka Roma), the Kalderash and the Lovari.
The first document certifying the appearance of the Roma in Poland dates from 1401
and comes from Kraków. Groups of the Roma travelling along the Carpathian Mountains and
from the side of the Hungarian Plain arrived in Poland and settled on its territories since the
15th century. Their descendants are the Carpathian Roma. Since the 16th century the Roma
started to come to Poland from Germany; they were later called the Polish Roma. In the 2nd
half of the 19th century from the territories of Transylvania and Wallachia started a migration
of the Kalderash (Kelderari – coppersmiths) and the Lovari (Lovari – horse traders).
The Carpathian Roma (for several hundred years leading a settled life) inhabit the
mountain lands of Małopolskie Voivodship. Relatively big centres of people belonging to the
15

Bergitka Roma group are also located in towns of Górny Śląsk and Dolny Śląsk and in Nowa
Huta, where in the 1950s the Roma were employed within the so called “productivization”
policy. The majority of the Roma members of the other three groups used to lead a nomadic
life. Now representatives of these communities usually live in the following towns and cities:
Warszawa, Poznań, Wrocław, Łódź, Kraków, Mielec and Puławy and in a number of smaller
municipal centres. This results from an obligatory settlement implemented by the authorities
of the Polish People’s Republic.
The Roma use the Roma language which, as in the case of Sanskrit, derives from the
Indo-Aryan languages. The Roma language developed over many centuries on the routes of
the Roma’s travels, which resulted in a considerable dialectal diversity, and in some cases in
the Creolization of the language of common Indian ancestors. It should be noted that the
Roma culture is an oral culture and did not create a codified written language. Therefore,
problems with transcription of the spoken language occur. Problems with the systematisation
of the Roma language enhance internal disputes among groups and communities of the Roma
in Europe, as well as the lack of a more extensive interest in this issue. In 1990 in Jadwisin
near Warszawa, during the meeting of the 4th International Congress of the International
Roma Union, on the initiative of the Roma philologist Marcel Courtiade, a project on the
rules of the standardisation and spelling of Roma (the so called Warsaw alphabet) was passed.
However, after nearly 20 years, the process of putting this system into practice is still at an
early stage. Some Roma leaders believe that due to the lack of own territory, national Church,
developed elites or common interpretation of the past and descent – the unified literary
language may be a significant bond for the dispersed Roma populations. However, there is
small awareness of this fact among the Roma themselves. The problem is also enhanced by
the dispute over the rule of unification of the Roma language itself. Its dialects (also the ones
used by the Roma in Poland) are so diversified that they are a distinguishing mark and an
identifier of groups in which they are used and this is still more important than, broader and
abstract for most Roma, ethnic community.
So far traditional Roma elites and authorities in Poland have been unwilling towards
the attempts to use the Roma language in the written version, suspecting that this may lead to
its popularisation among the non-Roma. In their opinion, this situation could endanger the
internal unity based on e.g. the “mystery” of the language. At the same time, in recent years a
process of Polonization of the dialects has been observed, which at a further stage will be
threatened with Creolization. Those who are concerned with this process, the Roma and
experts on the Roma community, emphasise the necessity to take actions counteracting this

16

issue as well as to prepare scientific aids, which in the near future could be used for teaching
the Roma children the Roma language also in the written form.
The Yiddish/Hebrew language
During the national census of people and dwellings which was carried out in 2002,
243 Polish citizens declared to use the Yiddish/Hebrew language in household relations,
including: in Mazowieckie Voivodship - 61, Dolnośląskie Voivodship - 53, Małopolskie
Voivodship – 23, Łódzkie Voivodship – 19, Śląskie Voivodship – 17, Lubelskie Voivodship,
Podkarpackie and Podlaskie Voivodships – 13, Lubuskie Voivodship, Pomorskie and
Wielkopolskie Voivodships – 6, Opolskie Voivodship – 4, Zachodniopomorskie Voivodship
–

Voivodships - 2. The Yiddish/Hebrew languages are used by people who declare to belong to
the Jewish minority. The Jews are dispersed mainly in big cities. The first information about
the Jews on the territories of Poland comes from the 10th century and the first official Polish
document granting them privileges and autonomy was the Statute of Kalisz of the 13th
century. The Jews arrived in Poland due to the relatively best (compared to the constant
pogroms in Western Europe) conditions of safe life and development of their own culture, as
well as because of the guaranteed, through the Royal Charters, autonomy of denominational
communes. The number of the Jews in Poland traditionally oscillated in the region of 10% of
the population (most in Europe). Development of Jewish life in Poland was brutally disrupted
by the 2nd World War and the Nazi policy Endlösung. Out of approx 3,500,000 of Polish
Jews, about 300,000 survived the war. In the period of the Polish People’s Republic during a
few emigration waves, most Polish Jews left the country. After 1989 there was a rebirth of
Jewish life in Poland. A lot of people returned to their Jewish roots. There were established
new organisations aimed at developing life of the Jewish community in our country.
The Jewish minority in Poland traditionally used two languages: Hebrew – the
liturgical language, and Yiddish – the everyday language. Yiddish derives from the Middle
High German dialect. Now, Yiddish is mainly used by elderly people. In Poland there are no
public schools teaching Hebrew or Yiddish as native languages. However, in Warszawa and
Wrocław there are private complexes of schools (a primary school and a junior secondary
school) with Polish as the language of instruction (Lauder-Morasha Complex of Schools in
Warszawa and Lauder-Etz Chaim – Gesher School of the Foundation of Jewish Culture and
Education in Wrocław). In these schools, pupils also learn the contemporary Hebrew
language and participate in classes aimed at familiarising them with the Jewish tradition,
history and culture. Apart from the primary and junior secondary schools, there is also a
kindergarten.
17

The Yiddish language is currently taught during courses conducted by the “Shalom”
Foundation and the Social and Cultural Association of the Jews in Poland. Courses in Hebrew
are organised by the Jewish denominational communes. The Yiddish and Hebrew language
courses are also carried out within Judaic studies organised in a number of Polish higher
education schools (e.g. the University of Warsaw and Jagiellonian University).

Information about the consultations during the preparation of the Report.

The 1st Report for the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on implementation
by the Republic of Poland of the provisions of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages was made by the Minister of Interior and Administration together with other
bodies of the government administration. The Report was the subject of consultations with the
Joint Commission of the Government and National and Ethnic Minorities – the consultative
and advisory body of the Prime Minister. The Joint Commission comprises representatives of
all communities using minority languages and a regional language in Poland.

7.

Measures aimed at propagating information on the rights and obligations
established in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages was published in the
Official Gazette of 27 August 2009 (Official Journal No. 137, item 1121). Moreover, the
content of the Charter and the Declaration made by the Republic of Poland to the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages as well as the explanatory Report to the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages are available on the website of the
Ministry of Interior and Administration:

PART II:
AIMS AND RULES IMPLEMENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 2 (1)
OF THE CHARTER
With reference to regional or minority languages on the territories on which such
languages are used, and depending on the situation of each language, the Parties shall base
their policies, legislation and practice on the following objectives
and rules:
a) recognition of regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth,

Protection of the languages of national and ethnic minorities is necessary for the
stabilization of the country, and the diversity of the languages deserves respect. This diversity
enriches the country and its citizens. It is the tradition that obliges Poland to such an attitude.
For centuries, the Republic of Poland was the home of religious and national tolerance in
Europe. An effect of this tolerance is the centuries-long presence in Poland of such minorities
as e.g. the Tatar, Jewish, Armenian, Karaim or Roma. As a result of the changes, which
occurred in Poland after 1989, people speaking the languages of national and ethnic
minorities and a regional language use all the rights resulting from the provisions included in
the national and international law. It should also be emphasised that taking appropriate actions
aimed to support the activities leading to the protection, preservation and development of
cultural identity of national and ethnic minorities, their languages, as well as to the
preservation and development of a regional language, is a statutory obligation of the Polish
public authorities.

b) respect of the geographical area of each regional or minority language in order to assure,
that the existing or new administrative divisions will not be an impediment to the promotion
of the particular regional or minority language,

The rule of respecting the geographical area of each minority and regional language is
reflected in the provision of Article 5 (2) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on
regional language, which prohibits the application of measures aimed at changing national or
ethnic proportions on the territories inhabited by minorities.
28

It should be noted, that during the formation of the new administrative division of the
country, which entered into force on 1 January 1999, one of the significant arguments for the
creation of Sejneński Poviat was the national structure of this area, inhabited to a large extent
by people using the Lithuanian language. Whereas during the formation of Opolskie
Voivodship e.g. the size of the German minority in this area was taken into account.
Furthermore, the commitment to refrain from actions which would result in national
changes on the territories inhabited by national minorities was also included in Article 15 of
the Treaty between the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Lithuania on Friendly
Relations and Good-Neighbourly Cooperation concluded in Vilnius on 26 April 1994
(Official Journal 1995 No. 15, item 71);

c) need for taking up a decisive action promoting regional or minority languages for the
purpose of their protection,

The Republic of Poland takes active actions, which promote the languages of national
and ethnic minorities and a regional language for the purpose of their preservation and
development. Detailed information on the said activities was provided in the point concerning
the implementation of Article 12 of the Charter.

d) facilitating or encouraging to speak and write in regional or minority languages in public
and private life,
In accordance with the provision of Article 27 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Poland of 2 April 1997 (Official Journal No. 78, item 483, with subsequent amendments) the
official language in the Republic of Poland is Polish. However, at the same time the
Constitution says that the foregoing regulation does not violate the rights of national
minorities resulting from the ratified international contracts. The last provision is applicable
with reference to people using minority languages. Moreover, it should be emphasised that
the regulation of Article 35 of the Constitution provides Polish citizens belonging to national
and ethnic minorities with freedom of preservation and development of their own language.
The rules contained in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland are extended in the
Act of 7 October 1999 on the Polish language (Official Journal No. 90, item 999, with
subsequent amendments) whose provision of Article 2 point 2 states that the regulations of the
Act do not violate the rights of national and ethnic minorities, as well as communities which
use a regional language.

29

At the same time, it should be noted that the regulations of Article 8 points 1 and 2 in
relation to Article 19 (2) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language
provide that people who belong to minorities and communities using a regional language are
entitled to the free use of their own language in private and public lives and to spread and
share information in the language of the minority.
Furthermore, positive reference to the use of a minority language both privately and
publicly can be found in the treaties concluded by the Republic of Poland with: the Federal
Republic of Germany, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, the Republic of Belarus and
the Republic of Lithuania.

e) preservation and development of relations, in the fields included in the present Charter,
between groups using a regional or minority language and other groups in the country using
a language applied in the identical or similar form, as well as creation of cultural contacts
with other groups in the country using different languages,

Article 6 (2) point 3 of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional
language obliges public authorities to take appropriate measures in order to strengthen the
intercultural dialogue.

f) assurance of appropriate forms and means of teaching and learning regional or minority
languages on all appropriate levels,

The right of people using minority languages to learn a native language, history and
culture of a minority is a factor of fundamental importance for the formation of national
identity, allows to cultivate their differences and thus prevents assimilation of the minority
circles. Polish system of education guarantees the right to learn minority languages and
provides conditions to organise the learning of minority languages, as well as in such
languages. The provision of Article 35 (1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland says
that the Republic of Poland provides Polish citizens who belong to national and ethnic
minorities with freedom of the preservation and development of their own language,
preservation of customs and tradition, as well as development of their own culture, which was
mentioned in point d. Moreover, the right of people who are members of minorities to be
taught native languages was specified in Article 8 point 4 of the Act on national and ethnic
minorities and on regional language.

30

Polish system of education provides school children who belong to minorities with
maintenance of their feeling of national, ethnic, language and religious identity and in
particular with the possibility of learning the language as well as their own history and
culture. The conditions and the way of carrying out these tasks were defined in the provisions
of the educational law which were specified in detail in part III with reference to the
implementation of Article 8 of the Charter.

g) facilitating people who do not use a regional or minority language, but who live in the
areas where it is used, to learn such a language if they want to,

People not using a regional or minority language, but living in the area where it is
used, have the possibility of learning such a language in accordance with the rules and
procedures specified in the Act of 7 September 1991 on the system of education (Official
Journal of 2004 No. 256, item 2572, with subsequent amendments). These issues were
discussed more thoroughly in part III of the Report.

h) promotion of studies and research into regional or minority languages in universities or in
similar scientific institutions,

The minister responsible for higher education supports the research projects
concerning minority languages and a regional language. From 1996 to 2008, funds from the
country’s budget were spent on financing the research projects of Prof. Anna Taborska, PhD
from the Institute of Slavic Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences within the particular
volumes of the “Etymological Dictionary of Kashubian”. Total amount spent on the
realisation of the said project came to PLN 333,000.00. The research activity concerning the
Karaim language – Trakai and Lutsk-Halych, is conducted within the Turkology studies in the
University of Warsaw (Anna Sulimowicz, doctorate), the Jagiellonian University (Michał
Nemeth, doctorate), Adam Mickiewicz University (Karaim studies – Mariola Abkowicz,
doctorate) and the Crimean dialect (Prof. Henryk Jankowski, Gulayhan Aktayewa, doctorate,
Dorota Smętek, doctorate). In the period 2007-2010 there was planned the realisation of the
research project of Prof. Henryk Jankowski, PhD from the Faculty of Neophilology of Adam
Mickiewicz University in Poznań, entitled the “Karaim-English Dictionary. The Crimean
Dialect”. In the period 2008-2009 the last project was subsidised from the country’s budget of
PLN 35,000.00.

31

Numerous initiatives aimed to develop Kashubian education and Kashubian studies
are taken by the University of Gdańsk. Currently, scientific and educational activities
concerning the Kashubian language and culture are conducted within the research actions of
the Faculty of History of the Polish Language, Dialectology and Onomastics, under the
supervision of Prof. Jerzy Treder, PhD (the Institute of Polish Philology of the Faculty of
Languages of the University of Gdańsk). In the Institute of Polish Philology there is employed
a large group of researchers-experts on Kashubian studies.
It is also worth noting that the Unit of Anthropology of Literature and KashubianPomeranian Study of the Institute of Polish Philology of the Pomeranian University in Słupsk
has been for many years conducting research on literary space and culture of Kaszuby Region.
The university also organises conferences and symposia in Kashubian studies together with
the Western-Kashubian Museum in Bytów, aimed at e.g. the creation of a permanent place of
study of Kashubian literature and culture.
Furthermore, information about minority languages and a regional language in higher
education schools was provided in the point concerning the implementation of Article 8 point
e (ii) of the Charter.

i) promotion of relevant kinds of international exchange, in the fields covered by the present
Charter, among regional or minority languages which are used in the identical or similar
form in two or more countries.

Information on the international exchange in the fields covered by the Charter among
minority languages which are used in the identical or similar form in two countries was given
in the point concerning the implementation of Article 14 of the Charter.

2. The Parties undertake to eliminate, if they have not done that yet, any unjustified
differentiation, exclusion, limitation or preferential treatment related to the use of a regional
or minority language whose objective is to discourage from using it or to endanger its
preservation or development. Spending special measures on regional or minority languages
which is aimed at promoting equality among users of these languages and the remaining part
of the population or which properly considers their special conditions is not regarded as an
act of discrimination of users of more popular languages.

The Republic of Poland does not implement any forms of differentiation, exclusion,
limitation or preferential treatment related to the use of minority languages and a regional
32

language, whose objective is to discourage from using the foregoing languages or to endanger
their preservation and development.

3. The Parties undertake to promote, by means of relevant measures, mutual understanding
among language groups, and in particular to respect and tolerate regional or minority
languages – within the objectives of education and trainings implemented in these countries –
as well as to encourage the mass media to pursue the same goal.

With reference to the aims and rules specified in Article 7 (2) and (3) of the Charter,
Article 6 of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language should be
emphasised, which provides as follows:
1. It is forbidden to discriminate anyone who belongs to a minority.
2. Public authorities are obliged to take appropriate actions to:
1) support a full and real equality in the field of economic, social, political and
cultural life among people belonging to minorities and those who are members of a majority;
2) protect people who are the object of discrimination, hostility or violence resulting
from their membership of minorities.
It should be stressed that the above-mentioned provisions are applicable towards
people using minority languages and the Kashubian language who are members of national
and ethnic minorities as well as communities using a regional language.
Moreover, in accordance with Article 31 (2) sentence 1 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Poland, Everyone is obliged to respect the freedom and rights of others, however,
Article 32 of the Constitution provides that:
1. Everybody has equal rights. Everyone is entitled to equal treatment by public authorities.
2. Nobody can be discriminated in political, social or economic life for any reason.
The information provided by the Government Plenipotentiary for Equal Treatment
shows that in the period from May 2008 to February 2010 no complaint was submitted to the
Office concerning unjustified differentiation, limitations or preferential treatment related to
the use of a regional or minority language.
However, it is worth stressing that the numerous activities concerning culture,
specified in the National programme for the prevention of racial discrimination, xenophobia
and intolerance connected with them 2004-2009 (since July 2008 coordinated by the
Plenipotentiary), treat a language as one of the elements of the preservation and development
of culture of national and ethnic minorities.

33

With regard to the right of people belonging to national and ethnic minorities and a
community using a regional language to the free use of their language in private and public
lives, the Monitoring of Racism and Xenophobia Team of the Department of Controls,
Complaints and Petitions of the Ministry of Interior and Administration, within its tasks, deals
with e.g. monitoring events which are signs of xenophobic and racist behaviour towards
people using minority languages. Recently, the Team has taken actions due to the acts of
destroying information boards containing additional German names of places in communes
situated on the territory of Opolskie Voivodship.
Furthermore, it should be mentioned that with regard to the problem of devastating the
said boards, about which representatives of national and ethnic minorities and communities
using a regional language informed the Joint Commission of the Government and National
and Ethnic Minorities, in January 2010 the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Interior and
Administration put forward to the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways and
Opolskie Voivode, Podlaskie Voivode, Pomorskie Voivode and Śląskie Voivode a request to
take actions aimed to appropriately secure the information boards containing additional names
of places in minority languages and a regional language, and in the event of any damage to
repair them immediately.

4. While determining their policies towards regional or minority languages, the Parties shall
consider needs and requests of groups using these languages. The Parties are encouraged to
establish organisations, if this is necessary, for the purpose of advising the authorities in all
matters connected with regional or minority languages.

People who use minority languages and the Kashubian language and who at the same
time belong to national and ethnic minorities and communities using a regional language have
the possibility of expressing their opinions on the implementation of their rights in the Joint
Commission of the Government and National and Ethnic Minorities. The Commission was
established based on Article 23 (1) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on
regional language as a consultative and advisory body of the Prime Minister.
The Joint Commission is particularly responsible for:
-

expressing opinions on the implementation of the rights and needs of minorities,
including an assessment of the way of the implementation of these rights and making
proposals within the activities aimed at ensuring the implementation of the rights and
needs of minorities,

34

-

giving opinions on programmes used for the creation of favourable conditions for the
preservation and development of cultural identity of minorities,

-

giving opinions on projects of legal acts concerning minorities,

-

giving opinions on amounts and rules of dividing the financial measures allocated in
the country’s budget for the support of activities aimed to protect, preserve and develop
cultural identity of minorities and to preserve and develop a regional language,

-

taking actions for the prevention of discrimination of people who belong to minorities.
The Joint Commission comprises representatives of: the minister in charge of religious

denominations and national and ethnic minorities, the minister in charge of the public
administration, the minister in charge of culture and protection of national heritage, the
minister in charge of education and behaviour, the minister in charge of public finance, the
minister in charge of labour, the Minister of Justice, the minister in charge of interior, the
minister in charge of social security, the minister in charge of foreign affairs, the President of
the Central Statistical Office, the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites,
the Head of the Chancellery of Prime Minister and representatives of national minorities
(Byelorussian, Czech, Lithuanian, German, Armenian, Russian, Slovak, Ukrainian, Jewish)
and ethnic minorities (Karaim, Lemkos, Roma and Tatar), as well as representatives of
communities using a regional language (Kashubian). Moreover, under the regulation of the
Council of Ministers of 12 February 2010 on incorporation into the Joint Commission of the
Government and National and Ethnic Minorities of a representative of the minister in charge
of higher education (Official Journal No. 28, item 148), a representative of the said minister
was incorporated into the Commission (on the day when the Act on national and ethnic
minorities and on regional language entered into force, the minister responsible for education
was at the same time the minister in charge of higher education).
Members of the Joint Commission are appointed and dismissed by the Prime Minister on
application of the minister in charge of religious denominations and national and ethnic
minorities. The co-presidents of the Joint Commission, who have equal rights, are: a
representative of the minister in charge of religious denominations and national and ethnic
minorities, and a representative of a minority and community using a regional language.
In accordance with the last Act, in order to appoint members of the Joint Commission
being representatives of a minority and community using a regional language, the Minister of
Interior and Administration submits to organisations of particular minorities and communities
a request to appoint agreed candidates to the Commission and then presents to the Prime
Minister the petition for appointing members of the Commission.

35

Costs connected with the functioning of the Joint Commission are covered from the budget
of the country, whereas the organisational and technical service of the works of the
Commission is provided by the Ministry of Interior and Administration.
Opinions of the Commission are submitted to the Prime Minister and the Council of
Ministers. The Joint Commission can also turn with a request for information and positions to
scientific institutions and circles, as well as social organisations. It can invite to its works
representatives of territorial self-government units, social organisations and scientific circles.
By the end of March 2010 there were 20 sessions of the Joint Commission of the
Government and National and Ethnic Minorities. Among other activities, every year the
Commission gave opinions on the amount of financial measures planned in the budget of the
country for the implementation of tasks aimed at preserving and developing cultural identity
of national and ethnic minorities, as well as at preserving and developing their languages, and
also at preserving and developing a regional language and on the rules of dividing the
subsidies for the said activities granted by the Minister of Interior and Administration. Within
the interest of the Joint Commission there was a project of the Act on ratification of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and a number of projects of
regulations of the Minister of National Education, concerning the issues of minority
languages and a regional language. The Joint Commission actively participates in
international meetings and consultations concerning the issues of minorities, their languages
and a regional language.

5. The Parties undertake to apply mutatis mutandis the rules specified in
sections 1-4 towards non-territorial languages. However, as regards these languages,
the character and scope of the measures which are to be applied for the purpose of the
implementation of the present Charter shall be determined in a flexible way, considering
needs and requests and respecting tradition and features of groups using these languages.

The rules included in Article 7 (1-4) of the Charter are applicable towards nonterritorial languages mentioned in the Declaration made by the Republic of Poland to the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Furthermore, it should be emphasised
that the Republic of Poland has undertaken to use the provisions of part III of the Charter
towards the said languages.

36

PART III:
MEASURES AIMED TO PROMOTE THE USE OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN PUBLIC LIFE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
COMMITMENTS MADE IN ARTICLE 2 (2) OF THE CHARTER
Article 8
Education
1. As regards education, the Parties undertake, on the territory where such languages
are used, in accordance with the situation of each of these languages and without
prejudice to teaching the official language (languages) of the country, to:
a) (i) make pre-primary education available in appropriate regional or minority
languages
b) (i) make primary education available in appropriate regional or minority
languages
c) (i) make secondary education available in appropriate regional or minority
languages
d) (iii) consider teaching of appropriate regional or minority languages as an
integral part of educational programme within technical and vocational
education,

Issues connected with the implementation of the right to learn a minority language or
in such language and to learn history and culture of a minority, as well as the right to learn a
regional language, are governed by the provision of Article 13 of the Act of 7 September
1991 concerning the system of education which reads as follows:
Article 13. 1 A public school and institution enables pupils to maintain the feeling of
national, ethnic, language and religious identity, and in particular to learn the
language, their own history and culture.
2. On application of parents, the learning defined in section 1 can be conducted:
1) in separate groups, departments or schools:
2) in groups, departments or schools with additional education of the language as well
as their own history and culture;
3) in interschool educational groups.
3. The minister in charge of education and behaviour shall specify, by means of a
regulation, the conditions and way of carrying out, by schools and institutions, the
tasks defined in sections 1 and 2, especially the minimum number of school children
for whom particular forms of education defined in section 2 are organised.
37

4. While teaching and upbringing, public schools ensure the maintenance of regional
culture and tradition.
5. School textbooks and auxiliary books used for teaching pupils in the field which is
necessary to maintain the feeling of national, ethnic and language identity, can be
subsidised from the budget of the country from the part which is put at the disposal of
the minister in charge of education and behaviour.
6. The minister in charge of education and behaviour shall take actions for the
purpose of ensuring the possibility of educating teachers and the access to textbooks
for use by public schools and institutions defined in section 1.
7. The minister in charge of education and behaviour shall take actions for the
purpose of the popularisation of knowledge of history, culture, language and religious
traditions of national and ethnic minorities as well as a community using a regional
language.
Detailed issues connected with the organisation of the classes discussed are governed
by the provisions of the regulation of the Minister of National Education of 14 November
2007 concerning the conditions and way of executing by public kindergartens, schools and
institutions the tasks which enable the maintenance of the feeling of national, ethnic and
language identity of school children who belong to national and ethnic minorities and
communities using a regional language (Official Journal No. 214, item 1579).
Article 13 of the Act on the system of education and the implementing rules to the act
guarantee the possibility of organising the learning of national and ethnic minorities and a
regional language on all educational levels – on the level of kindergarten education, primary
school, junior secondary school and post junior secondary schools. This possibility includes
post junior secondary schools of all types and specialisations – thus, school children of
secondary schools, technical secondary schools and vocational secondary schools have equal
rights to learn minority or regional languages.
The learning of minority or regional languages is organised by a head of a kindergarten or
a public school according to the voluntary principle, on application of parents or a pupil’s
legal guardians. There was also set the minimum number of school children being a base for
teaching the native language other than Polish in such a way as to enable the organisation of
teaching in small circles or in the conditions of dispersion of some minorities (this especially
concerns the Ukrainian national minority and the Lemkos ethnic minority). The number of 7
school children on the level of primary education (primary schools and junior secondary
schools) and 14 school children on the level of post junior secondary education is enough to

38

form a class in which the native language is taught. With regard to kindergartens, on the level
of the particular department the number of 7 children is enough.
Based on the above-mentioned regulation, the following forms of the organisation of
teaching a minority or regional language are possible:
-

teaching in a minority language or regional language in schools or departments in which
this language is the language of instruction, i.e. educational classes are conducted in
this language, except classes which include:
a) in primary schools: during the 1st stage of education – integrated teaching within the
content of teaching the Polish language; during the 2nd stage of education – the Polish
language and the part of history and society concerning Polish history;
b) in other types of schools – the Polish language, the part of history concerning Polish
history and the part of geography concerning the geography of Poland,

-

teaching in schools and departments in which educational classes are conducted in two
languages: in Polish and a language of a minority or a regional language being the second
language of teaching,

-

teaching a minority language as the additional subject, i.e. educational classes are carried
out in Polish, except classes in a minority language or regional language,

-

teaching a minority language or a regional language in interschool groups (if in particular
schools, the number of people interested is too small).
In kindergartens the teaching of a minority language or a regional language can be

organised:
-

in kindergartens or kindergarten departments in which classes are conducted in a minority
language or a regional language,

-

in kindergartens or kindergarten departments in which classes are conducted in two
languages: Polish and a minority language or a regional language;

-

in kindergartens or kindergarten departments in which classes in a minority language or a
regional language are conducted within 4 hours a week;

-

in inter-kindergarten groups of teaching a minority language or a regional language.
Moreover, it should be mentioned that for children fulfilling the obligation of the year-long

kindergarten preparation in kindergartens and kindergarten departments in primary schools in
which classes are conducted in a minority language or a regional language, the classes are
also carried out in Polish within 4 hours a week.
The teaching of a minority language and a regional language is financed from the budget
of the country. On the basis of the regulation of the Minister of National Education
concerning the way of dividing the parts of the total educational subsidy for territorial self39

government units given for the particular budget year the authorities which run (subsidise)
schools organising the education for minorities have at their disposal the educational subsidy
increased, in comparison to other schools, by 20% counted per one school child (with regard
to schools in which the number of school children who belong to minorities exceeds 84 in a
primary school and 42 in a junior secondary school and a post junior secondary school) or
150% (as regards schools in which there are fewer children belonging to minorities). With
relation to all schools, the amount of the increased educational subsidy came to altogether in
the year: 2008 – PLN 137,732,616, and in 2009 – PLN 170,197,043.
The table below shows the amount of educational expenses connected with teaching
languages of national and ethnic minorities and a regional language in 2008 and 2009.

On the basis of the regulation of the Minister of National Education of 30 April 2007
concerning the conditions and way of assessing, classifying and promoting school children
and students as well as organising tests and examinations in public schools (Official Journal
No. 83, item 562, with subsequent amendments), school children can take secondary
education final examinations [“Matura”] in a language of a minority, write tests after primary
schools and take examinations after junior secondary schools in a language of a minority or a
regional language.
Provisions of the educational law also govern other detailed issues related to the
organisation of teaching regional or minority languages, and in particular:
-

the creation of chains of schools teaching minority languages or a regional language,
without the necessity to set school districts – Article 58 (2) a of the Act on the system
of education,

-

the consideration, in the core curriculum of kindergarten education and general
education, of the aim and the content of teaching in the field of languages of national or
ethnic minorities and a regional language – regulation of the Minister of National
Education of 23 December 2008 on the core curriculum of kindergarten education and
general education in particular types of schools (Official Journal of 2009 No. 4, item
17) – applicable in the school year 2009/10 in the first classes of primary and junior
secondary schools and the regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport
of 26 February 2002 concerning the core curriculum of kindergarten education and
general education in particular types of schools (Official Journal No. 51, item 458, with
subsequent amendments) – the core curriculum specified in the annexes to the last
regulation is applicable in the remaining classes of primary, junior secondary and post
junior secondary schools by the end of the teaching cycle,

-

the fixing, in the framework teaching plans for particular types of schools, of hours
intended for the education of a language of minorities, their own history and geography
of the country with the cultural area of which the national minorities identify and a
regional language – regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport of 12
February 2002 on the framework teaching plans in public schools (Official Journal No.
15, item 142, with subsequent amendments),

-

the permission to use in schools educational programmes and the permission to use in
schools textbooks for learning languages of national or ethnic minorities, their own
history and geography of the country with which the national minority identifies in
terms of culture as well as for learning a regional language – regulation of the Minister
of National Education of 8 June 2009 on the permission to use in schools programmes
41

of kindergarten education and teaching programmes and the permission to use in
schools textbooks (Official Journal No. 89, item 730).
In bigger centres of people who use a minority language and a regional language there
was established a chain of schools teaching these languages. In the school year 2008/9 it
comprised 1008 units (including kindergartens, the reception class, primary schools, junior
secondary schools and post junior secondary schools as well as interschool groups) and
included in total 54 262 school children.
To the largest extent, the possibility of learning minority languages and a regional
language is used by school children of primary schools. On higher stages of education the
number of pupils interested in learning minority languages or a regional language is far lower.
Moreover, on the level of post junior secondary schools, school children of secondary schools
are much more often interested in learning a minority language or a regional language than of
technical and vocational secondary schools.
Below there is a statement with numbers concerning kindergarten units, school units
(including the reception classes and interschool groups) and school children learning a
minority language or

regional language as native languages, along with the list of

voivodships in which school children are taught a minority language or in such a language
(school year 2008/9 and school year 2009/10):
-

German – voivodships: Dolnośląskie, Opolskie, Pomorskie, Śląskie and Warmińskomazurskie (in total 510 units, altogether 38 323 pupils – in the school year 2008/2009;
in total 536 units, altogether 38 034 school children in the school year 2009/2010),

− Kashubian – Pomorskie Voivodship (in total 208 units, altogether 8 539 school
children – in the school year 2008/2009, altogether 254 units, altogether 9 856 school

− Byelorussian – Podlaskie Voivodship (in total 40 units, altogether 3408 school
children – in the school year 2008/2009; in total 40 units, altogether 3 214 school
children in the school year 2009/2010),
− Ukrainian – voivodships: Dolnośląskie, Lubuskie, Małopolskie, Mazowieckie,
Podkarpackie, Podlaskie, Pomorskie, Warmińsko-mazurskie, Zachodniopomorskie (in
total 142 units, altogether 2515 school children – in the school year 2008/2009; in total
139 units, in total 2 401 school children in the school year 2009/2010),
− Lithuanian – Podlaskie Voivodship (in total 18 units, altogether 689 school children –
in the school year 2008/2009; in total 18 units, altogether 687 school children in the
school year 2009/2010),

42

− the Lemkos language – voivodships; Dolnośląskie, Lubuskie, Małopolskie (in total 37
units, altogether 385 school children – in the school year 2008/2009; in total 33 units,
altogether 303 school children in the school year 2009/2010),
− Slovak – Małopolskie Voivodship (in total 11 units, altogether 230 school children –
in the school year 2008/2009; in total 12 units, altogether 183 school children in the
school year 2009/2010),
− Hebrew – Wrocław, Warszawa (6 non-public units, in total 296 school children – in
the school year 2008/2009; 6 non-public units, in total 307 school children in the
school year 2009/2010),
− Armenian – (one primary school in Kraków, 16 school children in the school year
2008/2009; in the school year 2009/2010 - 19 school children).
Taking account of the necessity of preserving and developing the Roma language
and the need of supporting the kindergarten preparation of the Roma children, the Ministry of
Interior and Administration and the Ministry of National Education in 2008 appointed a group
of experts on the Roma language. The effect of the group’s works is the proposal to
standardise the spelling of Roma considering dialectological differences which occur in
Poland, and the publication of primers for the Roma children, worked out by Karol Parno
Gierliński, in the dialect of the Polish Roma and the Carpathian Roma, the creation of their
multimedia versions and a web portal serving as a tool for further works and discussions
related to the development of the Roma language.

The data concerning teaching languages of national and ethnic minorities and
a regional language as native languages on particular stages of education is shown in the table
below1:

1

The number of units given above is lower than the total number of units in the tabular depiction. This results
from the fact that in the table there were separated kindergarten departments which are not independent units,
however, they are integral parts of secondary schools. These departments are usually run in schools in which
pupils learn minority languages or a regional language. The same applies to the interschool groups – they mainly
function in schools in which school children learn minority languages or a regional language . In the descriptive
part, primary school in which school children learn a language of a minority and at the same time functions a
kindergarten department in which children learn such a language, is shown only once. The same also applies to
schools in which interschool groups are run.

The data shown in the table was given according to the record on 30 September of the
particular school year.

45

The table does not include data on teaching the Roma language. The teaching of this
language in public schools is in the phase of preparation of the didactic base in cooperation
with the Roma circles.
There should also be indicated the fact of accepting, in 2002, the Strategy for
Development of Education of the Lithuanian Minority in Poland, which is a document written
jointly by representatives of the Lithuanian minority in Poland and representatives of the
government and self-government administration. Provisions of the Strategy concern, among
others, the problem of liquidation of small schools teaching the Lithuanian language on the
territory of Sejny Commune. As a result of meetings and discussions there was made a
decision on the liquidation indicating the possibility of concentrating the education for the
Lithuanian minority on the territory of Sejny Commune within the Centre of the Lithuanian
Education. Thanks to the commitment of Bishop Antanas Baranauskas Foundation „Dom
Litewski” [Lithuanian House] in Sejny on 1 September 2005 there started to operate the
Lithuanian school „Žiburys” which is run within the Centre for the Lithuanian Education in
Sejny. The Centre comprises a kindergarten, a primary school and a junior secondary school
with Lithuanian as the language of education. The primary school and junior secondary
school have a status of non-public schools with public school rights, and their body of
management is Bishop Antanas Baranauskas Foundation. The financial measures for the
operation of the unit come from e.g. the budget of the country within the educational system
subsidy given to territorial self-government units. Bishop Antanas Baranauskas Foundation
also receives an additional subsidy from the budget of the country on the basis of the
provisions of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language. In
December 2006 there was also accepted the Strategy for Development of Education of the
German Minority in Poland (in February 2007 approved by the Minister of Interior and
Administration and the Minister of National Education). This document was written with the
participation of territorial self-government units, superintendents of education, and also
organisations of the German minority in Poland. The main objectives of the Strategy was the
creation of bilingual schools with Polish and German as the languages of education and
increasing the number of pupils continuing the learning of German as a native language in
post junior secondary schools. The primary objective of this document is drawing up, for
schools with a language of the German minority, all the necessary textbooks and teaching
plans. Implementation of this aim requires close cooperation of experts on the organisations
of the German minority (especially the Association for German Education), authors,
publishers and the Minister of National Education. Another aspect significant for the
development of education of the German minority in Poland is the assurance of
46

methodological care for those who teach German or in the German language. In accordance
with the provisions of the Strategy in the Opole University there should be established a
centre for educating teachers of German as a language of a national minority. The first step to
achieve this aim shall be the inclusion in the programme of the studies, the methodology of
teaching German as a language of a minority. The ultimate objective is the creation, in the
Institute of German Philology of the Opole University, of the following specialisation –
teaching German as a language of a minority.

e) (ii) ensure the possibility of studying these languages as subjects
in educational system on the level of universities and higher education

In Poland there is a possibility of studying languages which are used by minorities as
subjects in the educational system on the level of universities and higher education in the field
of Philology. Moreover, the mentioned languages are taught during foreign language courses
organised in various faculties of studies. The list of minority languages which in 2008 were
the subject of education in universities and in higher education schools is in the annexe no. 1
to the Report.
It should also be emphasised that in the Institute of Russian Philology of the Pedagogical
University of Cracow since the academic year 2001/2002 there has been a speciality of
Russian Philology with the Rusyn-Lemkos language. The creation of the said speciality
resulted from the need of educating teachers of the Lemkos language. Since 2008 the
speciality of Russian Philology with the Rusyn-Lemkos language has been financed from the
budget of the Minister of Interior and Administration. Students of this speciality, apart from
substantive preparation for teaching the Lemkos language have also the possibility of
undergoing such student practical trainings as: pedagogical, cultural studies and language
studies, as well as workshops in ethnic journalism.
Furthermore, in the summer semester of the academic year 2009/2010 the University of
Gdańsk introduced the speciality – Kashubian Studies in the faculty of – Polish Philology.
Students of this speciality shall be familiarised with the qualities of the Kashubian language,
literary and writing output in this language. Among the subjects taught are: Kashubian
Literature, Practical Kashubian as well as History and Culture of Kaszuby Region. A graduate
of the field of Polish Philology, specialisation -

Kashubian studies, who has general

humanistic knowledge and at the same time regional humanistic knowledge will be prepared
for scientific work, for working as a teacher, culture animator, working in archives,
publishing houses, editorial offices of magazines, the mass media. Extended teaching
47

specialisation will provide students with substantive preparation to teach Polish and the
Kashubian language in different types of schools.
The University of Gdańsk also carried out three editions of postgraduate studies for
teachers of the Kashubian language financed from the European Union. Due to extensive
interest in the said studies, the university plans to continue them. Since 1989 the Institute of
Polish Philology of the University of Gdańsk has also been running a Kashubian language
course.
Furthermore, the Institute of Polish Philology of the Pomeranian University in Słupsk
since the academic year 2009/10 has been running postgraduate studies with the
methodological and cultural studies specialisation within the teaching of the Kashubian
language. The studies are addressed to people who have a diploma of completion of the first
or second degree studies in any field, who can speak and write in the Kashubian language.
Graduates of the said studies gain qualifications necessary to teach the Kashubian language at
school. In the school year 2009/10 there were about 60 applicants.
Representatives of national and ethnic minorities and communities using a regional
language submit a demand to create a system solution related to the functioning of the
Minority Language Philology, considering e.g. lower number of students in groups, and also
introducing special rules concerning the minimum staff and the possibility of employing
people from outside. In February 2010 the issue of the operation of the Minority Philology
Schools was the discussion topic of the Joint Commission of the Government and National
and Ethnic Minorities.

g) take actions aimed to ensure the education of history and culture corresponding with the
particular regional or minority language.

Provisions of the Act on the system of education introduce the possibility of teaching
history and culture corresponding with the particular regional or minority language, on the
basis of the teaching programmes drawn up and approved by a school. Textbooks for teaching
History are authorised for the school use by the Minister of National Education based on
opinions of experts. Authors and publishers of textbooks for teaching History and Geography
are obliged to take into account the recommendations of bilateral textbook commissions and
other commissions and teams for textbooks, acting on the basis of transnational contracts
concerning cooperation within education or contracts of the national committees of UNESCO.

48

h) provide teachers with a basic and further training necessary to
implement the points from a to g accepted by the Party,

Qualifications of teachers of minority languages and a regional language were defined
in the provisions of the regulation of the Minister of National Education of 12 March 2009 on
detailed qualifications required from teachers and on specification of schools and cases in
which there can be employed teachers who do not have higher education or who have not
completed the teacher training institution (Official Journal No. 50, item 400).
On the basis of the provisions of the regulation of the Minister of National Education
of 19 November 2009 concerning teacher training units (Official Journal No. 200, item 1537),
there is a possibility of appointing methodological advisers within the teaching of minority
languages and a regional language. In accordance with Article 5 (5) b and Article 5 a (2) point
3 of the foregoing Act on the system of education, voivodship in-service teacher training units
which are run by the voivodship self-government are in charge of organising and conducting,
according to the needs, methodological consultancy.
In 2009, the methodological care over schools for minorities was exercised by 5
teachers – consultants and 12 methodological advisers specialising in minority languages.

i) appoint a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring
the actions taken and the progress in the field of introduction or
development of teaching regional or minority languages and for
preparing periodical reports on conclusions drawn by them
which shall be made public

Supervision over the correctness of the organisation of the process of teaching minority
languages and a regional language in public schools on the territory of particular voivodships
is within the competence of voivodship superintendents of education.

2. With regard to the educational system and with reference to territories other than the
ones on which regional or minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties
undertake, if the number of people using a regional or a minority language justifies it,
to enable, encourage and ensure the education in a regional or minority language or
the education of this language on all appropriate teaching levels.

49

In the Polish system of education there is a possibility of teaching minority languages and
a regional language in schools which are on the territories other than the ones where the said
languages are traditionally used. The basis of conducting education of minority languages as
native languages is the minimum number of school children, specified in the provisions of the
educational law, whose parents or legal guardians informed about the need to organise the
said education. This issue was discussed in the point concerning the implementation of Article
8 (1) of the Charter.
Article 9
Judicial authorities
2. The Parties undertake:
a) not to contest the validity of legal documents drawn up within the country
only due to the fact that they have been written in a regional or minority language

The adoption by Poland of Article 9 (2) point a of the Charter is a confirmation of the
validity of the legal documents drawn up in minority languages and in a regional language. In
accordance with Article 2 point 2 of the above-cited Act on the Polish language, this Act does
not infringe rights of national and ethnic minorities and a community using a regional
language. However, it should be remembered that, in order to be able to successfully examine
evidence in legal proceedings which is based on a document draw up in a regional or minority
language it shall be necessary to translate such a document into an official language.

Article 10
Administrative authorities and public services

2. With reference to local and regional authorities on the territory of which the number
citizens who use regional or minority languages is such that it justifies the measures
mentioned below, the Parties undertake to allow or encourage

b) the possibility of submitting by users of regional or minority languages oral or
written petitions in these languages

The Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language provides the possibility
of using before commune authorities, apart from an official language, the languages of
national and ethnic minorities and a regional language as auxiliary languages. In accordance
with Article 9 of the foregoing Act, the auxiliary language can solely be used in communes
50

where the number of citizens of the commune belonging to a minority or using a regional
language is not lower than 20% of the overall number of the commune citizens, and the
commune itself has been entered into the Official Registry of Communes in which the
auxiliary language is used. Introduction of the auxiliary language is currently possible in 51
communes on the whole territory of Poland, including in Podlaskie Voivodship in 13, in
Opolskie Voivodship in 27, in Pomorskie Voivodship in 10 and in Śląskie Voivodship in 1
commune. The entry in the Official Registry of Communes is made by the minister in charge
of religious denominations and national and ethnic minorities, based on a petition of the
commune council.
Before the entry is made in the Official Registry of Communes, the minister verifies
the petition of the commune and can refuse to enter the commune if the petition does not meet
the requirements specified in the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional
language. In the event of the refusal to make the entry in the Official Registry of Communes,
the commune council is entitled to file a complaint to the Administrative Court. On the basis
of the authorization included in the Act, the Minister of Interior and Administration issued the
regulation in which specified the way of maintaining the registry as well as an example of the
petition for entering into this registry. Moreover, the Act on national and ethnic minorities and
on regional language provides that the commune can be crossed out of the registry only on
application of the commune council.
The last Act also governs the scope within which a minority language can be used
before commune authorities. It should be noted that an auxiliary language can solely be used
in contacts between an authority and people who are members of a minority. The Act allows
to refer to commune authorities in the auxiliary language in writing and orally, including
submission of an application. A representative of a minority can also, at the express request,
receive from the commune office an answer in the auxiliary language both in writing and in
the oral form, with the reservation that the appeal procedure is carried out only in an official
language.
The above-mentioned provisions show that an auxiliary language can be used in
contacts between an authority and representatives of the particular minority, however, it does
not influence the general rule of using an official language in contacts between an authority
and petitioners and the service of people who are not members of a minority.
The Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language also introduced
the mechanism aimed at encouraging employees of territorial self-government units to learn
auxiliary languages and as a result ensuring high quality of service for people belonging to
minorities in their native languages. In accordance with Article 11 (1) of the last Act, in a
51

commune entered into the registry, employees who work in the commune office, in auxiliary
units of the commune as well as in communal units and budget institutions are entitled to
receive a supplementary payment for knowledge of an auxiliary language. On the basis of the
authorisation included in the Act, the Minister of Interior and Administration issued a
regulation specifying the list of diplomas, letters of confirmation and certificates of a
command of minority languages.
Pursuant to Article 15 of the Act, costs connected with the introduction and the use of
an auxiliary language are covered from the budget of the commune.
According to the record on 29 September 2010, there are 30 communes entered into
the Official Registry of Communes, including six communes of Podlaskie Voivodship (in one
of the communes an auxiliary language is Lithuanian, in the remaining five – Byelorussian),
two communes of Pomorskie Voivodship (in which the auxiliary language is Kashubian) and
twenty-two communes of Opolskie Voivodship with German as an auxiliary language.
The first commune to have been entered into the Official Registry of Communes on 25
January 2006 was Radłów Commune with German as an auxiliary language. In 2006, into the
said Registry there were incorporated next fourteen communes, in 2007 five communes, in
2008 one commune, in 2009 seven communes and in 2010 two communes.
In sixteen communes of Opolskie Voivodship, one commune of Pomorskie
Voivodship and one commune of Podlaskie Voivodship, people who belong to a minority and
community using a regional language referred to the commune authorities in an auxiliary
language. In the said communes the people concerned received an answer in the auxiliary
language both in writing and in an oral form. An exception was the commune in Podlaskie
Voivodship where an answer was provided in Polish due to the fact that the applicants did not
demand the reply in the minority language. The answers given in the auxiliary language
concerned the following matters: public, social, insurance and taxes, inheritance, labour law,
residency registration and general registry, personal documents (identity cards, certificates of
births, marriages, deaths), environmental protection, purchase of lands, possibility of starting
investments, cooperation with partner towns (in the economic and cultural sphere). On the
territory of the said communes there are employed people with a very good command of
auxiliary languages.
The list of the communes entered into the Official Registry of Communes in which
there is used an auxiliary language, is available on the website of the Ministry of Interior and
Administration. The Registry is run by the Minister of Interior and Administration in an
electronic form.

and ethnic minorities and on regional language into the Official Registry of Communes, is in
the annexe no. 2 to the Report.

g) the use or acceptance, if it turns out to be necessary, together with a name in the official
language (languages), of traditional and correct forms of names of places in regional or
minority languages.

The Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language provides the
possibility of introducing on the territory of a commune additional traditional names of
streets, places and physiographic objects in languages of national and ethnic minorities and in
a regional language. Additional names of places can be introduced in a commune in two
cases: if as a result of the last national census, the officially set number of residents of
a commune declaring to belong to a minority or to use a regional language is not lower than
20% or if this requirement is not fulfilled, but on the territory of the commune there are places
in which the majority of residents during consultations opted for establishing an additional
name of the place in a minority or regional language.
The additional names of places cannot refer to the names from the period 1933-1945
granted by the authorities of the Third Reich or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. After
1933 the Nazi authorities on a mass scale changed names of places, a similar action – but to a
smaller extent – was carried out by the Soviet authorities after 1939. The legislator intended
to avoid a situation when additional names of places would refer to the foregoing totalitarian
systems.
Furthermore, additional traditional names of places in the languages of national and
ethnic minorities and in a regional language cannot be used separately. Based on the
authorisation included in the Act, the Minister of Infrastructure issued, in agreement with the
Minister of Interior and Administration, the regulation of 10 August 2005 on placing on signs
and boards additional names in the languages of national and ethnic minorities and in a
regional language (Official Journal No. 157, item 1320), according to which if on signs and
boards there is one name in Polish, the size of the letters used to write the additional name
should be the same as the size of the letters used to write the name in the Polish language.
However, if there is more than one name in Polish, the size of the letters used to write
additional names should be smaller by one-fourth. The style of the letters is the same in both
languages. Moreover, additional names are written with letters of the alphabet appropriate for

53

the language of the particular national or ethnic minority or for a regional language, taking
under consideration the specific for this alphabet diacritical marks.
In accordance with Article 12 (2) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on
regional language, the condition required to introduce an additional name of a place,
physiographic object or street in a minority or regional language is the incorporation of the
commune into the Registry of Communes, maintained by the minister in charge of religious
denominations and national and ethnic minorities, on the territory of which there are used
names in a minority language. The minister makes the entry on application of the commune
council.
On the basis of the authorisation included in the Act, the Minister of Interior and
Administration issued the regulation specifying the detailed scope of information contained in
the said Registry. This Registry pursuant to § 2 (2) of the regulation of the Minister of Interior
and Administration of 30 May 2005 on the Registry of Communes in which there are used
names in a minority language, on examples of petitions for entering into this Registry and on
establishing an additional name of a place or a physiographic object in the language of a
national or ethnic minority or in a regional language (Official Journal No. 102, item 85)
comprises: the Registry of Communes on the territory of which there are used additional
names of streets and the Registry of Communes where there are used additional names of
places and physiographic objects. Petitions for establishing an additional name of a place or a
physiographic object are evaluated by a Voivode and the Commission for Names of Places
and Physiographic Objects. Procedure of the evaluation of the names of places and
physiographic objects by the Commission is defined in the Act of 29 August 2003 on official
names of places and physiographic objects (Official Journal 166, item 1612, with subsequent
amendments) and in the regulation of the Minister of Interior and Administration of 5 August
2004 on the procedure of work of the Commission for Names of Places and Physiographic
Objects and on the amount of remuneration for its members for the participation in the
sessions (Official Journal No. 177, item 1831).
A negative opinion of the Commission results in a refusal to make the entry into the
Registry and consequently in a lack of the possibility of using this name as an additional name
on the territory of the commune. In the event of the refusal to make the entry, the commune
council is entitled to file a complaint to the administrative court.
According to the record on 29 September 2010, there are 33 communes incorporated into
the Registry, including twenty two communes of Opolskie Voivodship (additional names in
German), seven communes of Pomorskie Voivodship (additional names in Kashubian), two
communes of Śląskie Voivodship (additional names in German), one commune of Podlaskie
54

Voivodship (additional names in Lithuanian) and one commune of Małopolskie Voivodship
(additional names in the Lemkos language). The first commune to have been entered into the
Registry on 22 December 2006 was Radłów Commune with additional names in German, in
2007 into the said Registry there were entered next three communes, in 2008 fifteen
communes, seven communes in 2009 and seven communes in 2010.
So far no commune filed a petition for entering into the Registry of Communes in
connection with the intention of introducing on its territory additional names of streets in a
minority language.
Furthermore, petitions of the communes: Orla, Reńska Wieś, Bierawa, Parchowo and
Sulęczyno have been submitted to the Commission for Names of Places and Physiographic
Objects.
The list of the communes incorporated into the Registry of Communes on the territories
of which there are used names in a minority language is available on the website of the
Ministry of Interior and Administration. The Registry is run by the Ministry of Interior and
Administration in an electronic form.
The list of communes entered, on the basis of Article 12 of the Act on national and ethnic
minorities and on regional language, into the Registry of Communes where there are used
names in a minority language is in the annexe no. 3 to the Report.
In accordance with Article 15 (2) of the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on
regional language, costs connected with a change of information boards resulting from the
establishment of an additional name of a place or a physiographic object in a minority
language are covered from the budget of the country.
On 10 March 2008 there was concluded the first agreement between the Minister of
Interior and Administration and Radłów Commune concerning the transfer of financial
measures from the budget of the country intended for the change of information boards in
relation to the introduction of additional names of places in a minority language. By 29
September 2010 the Minister of Interior and Administration signed agreements concerning
the implementation of the tasks connected with the change of information boards containing
additional names of places in minority languages and a regional language with the following
communes: Chmielno, Cisek, Stężyca, Chrząstowice, Izbicko, Tarnów Opolski, Puńsk,
Dobrodzień, Leśnica, Ujazd, Gorlice, Zębowice, Biała, Walce, Głogówek, Komprachcice,
Strzeleczki, Bytów, Sierakowice, Jemielnica, Szemud and Kolonowskie.
Currently, three communes are waiting for an award of the subsidy to cover the costs of
changing the information boards. In 2008 from the budget of the Minister of Interior and
Administration for the change of the information boards there was sent a subsidy of - PLN
55

443,532.92, in 2009 – PLN 537,446.552. The amount of PLN 600,000.00 is planned in the
budget for the year 2010. Until now there have been used measures of PLN 597,569.00.

5. The Parties undertake to allow, on application of interested people, to use or
assume surnames in regional or minority languages.

Polish citizens who belong to national and ethnic minorities, pursuant to Polish
legislation, can change names and surnames to a version being in accordance with the
pronunciation and spelling of a native language under the administrative procedures, on the
basis of the Act of 17 October 2008 on the change of a name and surname (Official Journal
No. 220, item 1414). Changes of spelling of names and surnames can be made in the
Registries of Births, Marriages and Deaths appropriate for the place of residence. The right of
people belonging to national minorities to use and spell their names and surnames in
accordance with the spelling rules of a minority language, in particular to register in vital
records and in identity documents, was also guaranteed in Article 7 (1) of the Act on national
and ethnic minorities and on regional language. Pursuant to section 2 of the foregoing Article
names and surnames of people who are members of a minority written in an alphabet other
than the Latin alphabet are subject to transliteration. On the basis of the authorisation included
in the Act, the Minister of Interior and Administration issued a regulation specifying the way
of transliteration requiring to consider spelling rules of a minority language. This solution
arose from the willingness of avoiding difficulties in reading names and surnames which
would result from the spelling in other alphabets. The regulation of the Minister of Interior
and Administration of 30 May 2005 on the way of transliteration of names and surnames of
people belonging to national and ethnic minorities written in an alphabet other than the Latin
alphabet (Official Journal No. 102, item 855), provides the conduct of the said transliteration
towards names and surnames of people who belong to the following minorities: Byelorussian,
Lemkos, Armenian, Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish.
The right to use names and surnames with the pronunciation of the language of a national
minority is also guaranteed in the Treaties on Friendship and Good-Neighbourly Relations
with the Federal Republic of Germany, Ukraine, the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of
Lithuania.

2

The amount given to communes for the implementation of the tasks related to the change of information boards
resulting from the establishment of additional names in minority languages and a regional language. Measures
for this aim were assured in the budget of the county of PLN 500,000.00. The reason for bigger, than it was
planned, amount of the subsidies given to communes results from the fact that a part of the measures was not
used and returned to the budget of the country and then again transferred to other communes.

56

In 2009, 100 people changed their names and surnames under the administrative
procedures (83 people changed to the German language, 7 – to Lithuanian, 4 – to Hebrew, 2 –
to Russian and Roma, 1 – to Ukrainian and Armenian).
Due to signals from representatives of national and ethnic minorities concerning the
problem of insufficient knowledge of employees of the Registries of Births, Marriages and
Deaths of the right of people who belong to a national minority to use and write names and
surnames according to the spelling rules of a minority language, in particular to register in
vital records and in identity documents, in December 2009 the Secretary of State in the
Ministry of Interior and Administration turned to all Voivodes with a request to remind the
Registries of Births, Marriages and Deaths of the right which minorities have. The
information which the Minister of Interior and Administration received shows that Voivodes
sent to commune authorities on the territories of their voivodships letters reminding of the
foregoing right. Furthermore, the issue of spelling names and surnames of people who belong
to minorities shall be the subject of a training for superintendents of the Registries of Births,
Marriages and Deaths and shall also be subject to detailed control in the said offices.

Article 11
The media
1. The Parties undertake with regard to users of regional or minority languages on the
territories where these languages are used, depending on the situation of each
language, within the scope of direct or indirect competence of public authorities, their
entitlements or the part which they play in this field, and in accordance with the rule
of independence and autonomy of the media:
a) to the extent within which radio and television fulfil a public service task:
(ii) to encourage to create or to facilitate to create at least one radio station
and one television channel in regional or minority languages, or
(iii) to issue an appropriate provision requiring from broadcasters to offer programmes
in regional or minority languages,

With reference to the above-mentioned issues, it should be noted that the provision of
Article 54 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland reads as follows:
1. Everyone is entitled to the freedom of expressing their views and of receiving and
spreading information.

57

2. Preventive censorship of the media and the licensing of the press are banned. The Act
can introduce an obligation of prior obtainment of the licence to run a radio or
television station.
Moreover, pursuant to the provision of Article 213 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Poland: the National Broadcasting Council guards the freedom of speech, the right to
information and public interest in radio and television broadcasting.
The Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language introduced changes
in the Act of 29 December 1992 on radio and television broadcasting (Consolidated text:
Official Journal of 2004 No. 253, item 253, with subsequent amendments), extending the
catalogue of tasks connected with the fulfilment of the public service task by adding the task
related to the consideration of needs of national and ethnic minorities and communities using
a regional language including the broadcasting of information programmes in the languages
of national and ethnic minorities and in a regional language.
According to the National Broadcasting Council, the programmes addressed to national
and ethnic minorities and communities using a regional language altogether meet the
following criteria:
-

they are fully dedicated to the issues concerning national, ethnic minorities and

communities using a regional language,
-

they are attended by representatives of national or ethnic minorities or a community using

a regional language,
-

they are addressed to national or ethnic minorities or a community using a regional

language,
-

they are broadcast in the language of national, ethnic minorities or in a regional language,

-

they are edited by a team comprising representatives of interested national, ethnic

minorities or a community using a regional language.
The programmes in the languages of national and ethnic minorities and in a regional
language are financed from the measures of the National Broadcasting Council. While
specifying the way of dividing receipts from subscription fees for using radio and television
receivers, starting from the division for the year 2006, the National Broadcasting Council
allocates financial measures for the costs of the programme broadcast by Radio Olsztyn S.A.
[Radio Olsztyn PLC] for the Ukrainian minority. For financing this programme the National
Broadcasting Council allotted in the period 2007-2009 the amount of PLN 207,000 each year.
Additionally within the measures intended to cover the costs of fulfilling the task,
mentioned in Article 21 (1) of the Act on radio and television broadcasting, there were

58

allotted financial measures for financing direct costs of producing programmes for national
and ethnic minorities in companies of regional radio broadcasting.
The summary record of amounts from the bank account of the National Broadcasting
Council allocated through decisions of the National Broadcasting Council on financing direct
costs of producing the foregoing programmes and on performance according to the data from
regional companies, in the years 2007-2008, was as follows (in thousands of PLN):

b) (ii) to encourage the regular broadcasting or to facilitate the regular broadcasting
of radio programmes in regional or minority languages

As a supplement to the information in the point above it should be indicated that in
accordance with the provisions of Article 18 (2) point 4 of the Act on national and ethnic
minorities and on regional language, public authorities are obliged to take suitable measures
in order to support the activities aimed at protecting, preserving and developing cultural
64

identity of minorities and at preserving and developing a regional language, and these
measures can be, in particular, targeted or specified-user subsidies for supporting television
programmes and radio broadcasts conducted by minorities. Moreover, the National
Broadcasting Council while carrying out the licensing procedures takes into account needs
about which organisations of national and ethnic minorities and a community using a regional
language inform. In this field there should be mentioned the licence exercised by the Puck
Region Association from Władysławowo granted by the National Broadcasting Council for
the purpose of broadcasting the radio programme called Radio “Kaszëbë”. Radio “Kaszëbë”
is a non-public radio station broadcasting a programme of universal character. In the radio
most broadcasts have a form of news or feature, cultural, entertaining and educational
programmes. Most of the station’s programmes concern widely-understood local issues.
Furthermore, Radio „Kaszëbë” presents music in the Kashubian language. In 2008, Radio
„Kaszëbë” which before had broadcast its programme from the transmitting stations in
Gdynia and Gdańsk extended its broadcasting range by the transmitting station in
Kościerzyna. The number of people covered by the broadcasting range of the programme
currently amounts to 800,000 and involves the following towns: Gdańsk, Gdynia, Hel,
Jastarnia, Kartuzy, Pruszcz Gdański, Puck, Reda, Rumia, Sopot, Wejherowo, Władysławowo,
Kościerzyna and nearby villages and communes. Now, about 40 – 50 % of the programmes
which are broadcast on the waves of the radio are the programmes carried out in a regional
language. The radio’s activities are supported from the financial measures of the Government
of the Republic of Poland.
Moreover, the possibility of broadcasting radio programmes addressed to minorities is
used by three non-public radio broadcasters:
The Byelorussian Radio “Racja” [Radio Right] is a non-public radio station broadcasting
a programme in Byelorussian. The station addresses its programmes to the Byelorussian
minority in Poland and to citizens of the Republic of Belarus. The air is dominated by
information, feature programmes, broadcasts of social and cultural character and music. The
station broadcast its programme in the years 1999 – 2002. In 2002, the radio suspended its
broadcasting for financial reasons. The broadcasting started again in February 2006. The
radio’s activities are supported from financial measures of the country’s budget. On 3 June
2009 the „Białoruskie Centrum Informacyjne” Sp. z o.o [Byelorussian Information Centre,
Limited Liability Company] obtained a licence for next 10 years to broadcast a radio
programme called „Białoruskie Radio Racja” [Byelorussian Radio Right]. Its programme is
currently broadcast from the transmitting stations in Białystok and Biała Podlaska.
“Białoruskie Centrum Informacyjne Sp. z o.o.” [Byelorussian Information Centre, Limited
65

Liability Company] in order to extend its broadcasting range and to improve the quality of
broadcasting the programme filed an application for increasing power of the transmitting
stations in Białystok which would allow to extend the range of the station by approx 130,000
people. Now the number of residents who are within the range of the programme amounts to
815,000 and includes the following towns on the Polish side of the border with Belarus: Biała
Podlaska, Białystok, Biała Piska, Bielsk Podlaski, Choroszcz, Czarna Białostocka, Goniądz,
Jedwabne, Kleszczele, Knyszyn, Łapy, Mońki, Rajgród, Sokółka, Stawiski, Suchowola,
Supraśl, Suraż, Szczuczyn, Tykocin, Wasilków Zabłudów and nearby villages and
communes. In 2009 on the waves of the radio within the everyday programme broadcast in
the Byelorussian language there were presented 5 cyclical programme blocks addressed solely
to the Byelorussian minority (Podlaski tydzień [Podlaski week], Podlaski concert życzeń
[Wishes and songs of listeners from Podlasie], Kultura bez granic [Culture without borders],
Audycja kulturalna dla młodzieży [Cultural programme for teenagers], Bajki dla dzieci [Fairy
tales for children]). Total duration of the mentioned broadcasts came to over 250 hours. Radio
“Racja” [Radio “Right”] broadcasts in the Byelorussian language.
Moreover, on the air of the private Radio “Vanessa” [Radio “Vanessa”] there are two
programmes addressed to the German minority. The broadcast Die deutsche stimme aus
Ratibor is directed to older generation of listeners. The programme includes reports from life
of the German minority, local news, wishes and music. The other of the programmes is a
magazine for teenagers – Mittendrin. The programme deals with actual matters from life of
teenagers belonging to a minority. These broadcasts are carried out by people connected with
the Social and Cultural Association of Germans of Śląskie Voivodship. Authors of the
programmes pay a fee to Radio “Vanessa” [Radio “Vanessa”] for their broadcasting.
Measures from the country’s budget are spent on financial support of the preparation and
production of the two said broadcasts. On 7 August 2009 Radio “Vanessa” Sp. z o.o.” [Radio
Vanessa, Limited Liability Company] obtained a licence for next 10 years. The programme is
broadcast from the stations in Strzybnik near Racibórz. The number of people covered by the
range of the programme amounts to 124,000 and includes the following places: Baborów,
Kietrz, Krzanowice, Kuźnia Raciborska, Racibórz and nearby villages and communes. The
programmes are broadcast in the German language.
Programmes in the German language are also broadcast on the wave bands of Radio
“Park FM” from Kędzierzyn-Koźle. Once a week on the air of this radio there is a 1-hour
broadcast in German „Kaffeeklatsch” co-produced by organisations of the German minority.
Since 2009 measures from the country’s budget have been spent on financial support of the
costs related to the preparation of the programme.
66

c) (ii) to entourage the regular broadcasting or to facilitate the regular broadcasting
of television programmes in regional or minority languages,

The information provided by the National Broadcasting Council shows that it has not
received a petition for granting the licence for broadcasting a television programme broadcast
in the language of a national, ethnic minority or in a regional language.

d) to encourage the production and distribution of sound and audiovisual works in
regional or minority languages or to facilitate such a production and distribution,
e) (i) to encourage the creation or to facilitate the creation or maintenance of at least one
newspaper in regional or minority languages

f) (ii) to apply the existing financial support measures also with regard to
audiovisual works in regional or minority languages,

With reference to the provisions included in Article 11 (1) points d, e (i), f (ii) it should be
noted that in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 (2) point 3 of the Act on national
and ethnic minorities and on regional language, the public authorities are obliged to take
suitable measures in order to support the activities aimed at protecting, preserving and
developing cultural identity of minorities as well as at preserving and developing a regional
language, and these measures can be, in particular, in the form of targeted subsidies or
specified-user subsidies for publishing books, magazines, periodicals and brochures in
minority languages or in Polish, printed or in other techniques of recording picture and sound.
Subsidising tasks connected with culture and the language of national and ethnic
minorities and a community using a regional language falls within competence of the minister
in charge of religious denominations and national and ethnic minorities i.e. now within the
Minister of Interior and Administration. The Minister of Interior and Administration takes
care of enabling every national and ethnic minority to use at least one own magazine (in a
native language or Polish, but magazines in a native language are preferred). Some minorities
issue more than one magazine. Nearly all magazines of national and ethnic minorities and
communities using a regional language are subsidised from the country’s budget. In 2008
from the budget of the Minister of Interior and Administration there was spent the amount of
PLN 3,485,657 on supporting the publication of 38 titles. In 2009 on publication of 37
periodicals there was spent, from the budget of the Minister of Interior and Administration,
67

the amount of PLN 3,406,944. In 2010 the amount of PLN 3,714,520 was spent on the
publication of 36 titles.
Titles of the most important magazines of the particular national and ethnic minorities
and community using a regional language are listed below:
The Byelorussian minority – „Niwa” – weekly, „Czasopis” – monthly, „Bielski Hostineć”
– quarterly, „Białoruskie Zeszyty Historyczne” [Byelorussian History Notebooks] – halfyearly, „Termapiły” – yearly.

The Karaim minority – „Awazymyz” – published three times a year.
The Lithuanian minority – „Aušra” – fortnightly, „Aušrelé” – monthly for children,
„Šaltinis” – quarterly.
The Lemkos minority – „Besida” – quarterly, „Watra” – quarterly, „Rocznik Ruskiej

g) to support the training of journalists and other people employed in the media
who use regional or minority languages.

68

In a number of universities and higher education schools in Poland there is a possibility of
studying in the field of Journalism. Graduates of the said field of study also work in the media
using minority languages and a regional language. Moreover, it is worth reminding of the
possibility of participating in workshops in Ethnic Journalism within the studies at the faculty
of Russian Philology with the Rusyn-Lemkos language.

2. The parties undertake to guarantee the freedom of direct reception of radio and
television broadcast from the neighbouring countries in a language used in the same form
as or a similar form to a regional or minority language and not to object to the
rebroadcasting of radio and television programmes in such a language from the
neighbouring countries. Furthermore, the Parties undertake to ensure that there shall not
be imposed any restrictions on the freedom of speech and on the free flow of information
in the printed media in a language used in the same form as or a similar form to a
regional or minority language. Since the use of the foregoing liberties entails obligations,
it can be subject to the same formal requirements, conditions, restrictions or penalties as
provided in law and as are necessary in the democratic society, as are in the interest of
national security, territorial integrity or public security, on account of the necessity to
prevent unrest or crime, protection of health and morality, protection of reputation and
rights of other people, prevention of disclosure of information obtained as confidential, or
maintenance of the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

Freedom of the reception of broadcasts from the neighbouring countries in a language
used in the same form as or a similar form to a minority language is guaranteed by the Act on
radio and television broadcasting. In accordance with the content of Article 1 (2): “Reception
of national and foreign programmes intended by the broadcasters for common reception is
free, subject to the conditions laid down in the legal provisions”.
It is also worth noting that the freedom of receiving and giving information in a
language of national and ethnic minorities results from Article 54 of the Constitution
concerning the freedom of speech and the press. It should also be emphasised that the right to
spread and exchange information in the native language was provided in the treaties which
were signed by Poland and: the Federal Republic of Germany, the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic, Ukraine, the Republic of Belarus and the Republic of Lithuania.

3. The Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of users of regional or minority
languages shall be represented or considered in such organs as may be established in
69

accordance with law and at the same time to guarantee the freedom and pluralism of
the media.

The amendments introduced to the Act on radio and television broadcasting also added
the provision concerning the participation of representatives of minorities in programme
councils of public radio and television. According to the Act, while appointing programme
councils of the branches of public radio and television which broadcast programmes in the
languages of national and ethnic minorities and a regional language, directors of the branches
take into consideration candidates proposed by social organisations of these minorities and
communities. The programme councils operating in the public media, in accordance with the
Act on radio and television broadcasting, are appointed for the term of office lasting 4 years.
During the elections conducted for the term of office in the years 2008-2012, the National
Broadcasting Council appointed Michał Pulkowski to the Programme Council of Radio
Rzeszów SA [Radio Rzeszów, PLC] who was recommended by the Association of Ukrainians
in Poland and Roman Radziwonowicz to the Programme Council of Radio Koszalin SA
[Radio Koszalin, PLC] who also represented the Association of Ukrainians in Poland.

Article 12
Cultural activities and objects of culture
1. With regard to cultural activities and objects – and in particular to libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, associations, theatres and cinemas, as
well as to literary and film works, common forms of cultural expression, festivals and
cultural organisations, including e.g. the use of new technologies – the Parties
undertake, on the territories where such languages are used, and to the extent within
which the public authorities are competent, have the right or within which play a part
in this field:
a) to support forms of expression and initiatives appropriate for regional or minority
languages and to promote various forms of access to works made in these languages,
b) to support various forms of access in other languages to works created in regional or
minority languages through maintaining and developing activities within translation,
dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitles,
c) to support access in regional or minority languages to works created in other
languages through maintaining and developing activities within translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitles,

70

d) to ensure that organs responsible for organising and supporting various kinds of
cultural activities, within an appropriate scope, use the knowledge and the command
of regional or minority languages and cultures in actions which are initiated or
supported by them,
e) to promote solutions which ensure that organs responsible for organising and
supporting various kinds of cultural activities have at their disposal employees who
have a full command of an appropriate regional or minority language, as well as a
language (languages) of the remaining part of the population,
f) to encourage the direct participation of representatives of people using a particular
regional or minority language during the formation of objects and while planning
cultural activities,
g) to support or facilitate the creation of institutions responsible for collecting, storing
copies and presenting or publishing works made in regional or minority languages,
2. With regard to territories other than the ones where regional or minority languages
are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of people using a regional
or minority language justifies it, to allow, support or ensure appropriate actions and
cultural measures, in accordance with the previous section.

The provisions laid down in Article 12 (1) points a, b, c, d, e, f, g and (2) of the Charter
concerning cultural activities are implemented on the basis of Article 35 of the Constitution of
the Republic of Poland. The said Article guarantees Polish citizens who belong to national
and ethnic minorities the freedom of preservation and development of their own language,
preservation of customs and tradition of their culture. People using the languages of national
and ethnic minorities are entitled to establish their own educational, cultural institutions and
institutions aimed at the protection of religious identity and to participate in settling matters
concerning their cultural identity. Details of the issues and specification of sources of
financing cultural activities of minorities were provided in Article 18 and Article 20 (2) of the
Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language which impose on public
authorities an obligation of taking suitable measures aimed to support the actions intended for
the protection, preservation and development of cultural identity of minorities and their
language as well as for the preservation and development of a regional language, which was
mentioned in the point concerning the implementation of the provisions of Article 11 of the
Charter.
The Act specifies ten groups of tasks on which subsidies can be spent. They are as
follows:
71

1) activities of cultural institutions, the artistic movement and works of minorities and
artistic events which are of significant importance to culture of minorities;
2) investments aimed at preserving cultural identity of minorities;
3) publication of books, magazines, periodicals and brochures in the minority languages
or in Polish, printed and in other techniques of recording picture and sound;
4) support of television programmes and radio broadcasts produced by minorities;
5) protection of places connected with culture of minorities;
6) day-care room activities;
7) running libraries and carrying out the documentation of cultural and artistic life of
minorities;
8) education of children and teenagers conducted in different forms;
9) promotion of knowledge of minorities;
10) other programmes aimed at supporting activities intended for the protection,
preservation and development of cultural identity of minorities and programmes
supporting civic integration of minorities.
It should be emphasised that apart from targeted subsidies for the implementation of the
tasks defined above, there is a possibility of giving, from the country’s budget, subsidies for
investments and specified-user subsidies. The specified-user subsidies can be granted to
organisations of national and ethnic minorities and to organisations of communities using a
regional language, and also to cultural institutions which are of significant importance to
culture of minorities. With regard to the subsidies granted for the implementation of the
foregoing tasks, there are preferred organisations of national and ethnic minorities and
organisations of communities using a regional language. It is also worth mentioning that
subsidies can be granted to tasks implemented outside the territory of the Republic of Poland.
This applies to activities of cultural institutions, artistic movement and works of minorities
and artistic events which are of significant importance to culture of minorities, as well as
education of children and teenagers, implemented on the territory of the European countries
with which the particular national or ethnic minority is connected in terms of culture and
history.
Every year, the Minister of Interior and Administration announces procedures concerning
the granting of subsidies. It is worth noticing that representatives of national and ethnic
minorities and a community using a regional language participate in working out the said
procedures through the agency of the Joint Commission of the Government and National and
Ethnic Minorities.

72

The amount of budget measures spent on the implementation of tasks aimed at protecting,
preserving and developing cultural identity of minorities and preserving and developing a
regional language has remained over the last years on a similar level.
Below there is a table with total amounts given to the particular minorities from the
country’s budget in the years 2009 – 2010 for the implementation of all the foregoing tasks,
including tasks aimed at preserving and developing the languages of minorities and a regional
language.

It should be noticed that the table does not include the measures which are used by people
using minority languages and a regional language under the general rules (they are only the
additional amounts connected with the preservation of cultural identity of minorities or the
protection of the language). Moreover, it should also be emphasised that the foregoing data

includes only measures given from the country’s budget, but does not include measures spent
by territorial self-government units.

3. The Parties undertake to appropriately consider, within the cultural policy conducted
abroad, the regional or minority languages and cultures which correspond to them.

Information on the implementation of the foregoing provisions was included in the point
concerning the implementation of Article 14 of the Charter.

Article 13
Economic and social life
1. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake
in the whole country:
b) to forbid to include in internal provisions of companies and private
documents any clauses excluding or restricting the use of regional or minority
languages, at least among users of the same language,
c) to object to actions aimed at discouraging from using regional or minority
languages in connection with economic or social activities,
d) to facilitate or support the use of regional or minority languages by means of other
methods than the ones specified in the points above.

Provisions of Article 13 (1) points b, c and d are implemented in Poland based on
Article 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, according to which:
1. Everyone has equal rights. Everyone has the right to equal treatment by public authorities.
2. Nobody can be discriminated in public, social or economic life for any reason.

Moreover, it must be emphasised that as regards the relations with the participation of
consumers and during the implementation of the provisions within the Labour law, the Article
8 (1), 1 a and 1 b of the Act on the Polish language applies according to which the documents
within the said scope, including in particular contracts with the participation of consumers and
contracts within the Labour law, are drawn up in Polish, with the reservation that these
documents can be written, at the same time, in a foreign-language version or versions. The
74

basis of their interpretation is the version in Polish if a person who performs work or a
consumer are citizens of the Republic of Poland. Furthermore, an employment contract or
another document resulting from the scope of the Labour law and also a contract whose party
is a consumer, or other than a contract documents applicable in relations with the participation
of consumers, can be draw up in a foreign language on application of a person performing
work or a consumer who use this language, who are not Polish citizens and who were
previously advised of their right to make a contract or another document in Polish.

2. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, to the extent
within which public authorities have competence, on the territory where regional or
minority languages are used, and to such an extent within which it is sensibly
possible:

b) in economic and social sectors being directly under their control (public sector), to
organise activities promoting the use of regional or minority languages.

The provision of the said Article is implemented based on the Act on national and
ethnic minorities and on regional language. The provision of Article 21 (2) point 4 of the last
Act says that the minister in charge of religious denominations and national and ethnic
minorities propagates information on minorities and their culture and also initiates the
research on the situation of minorities, including within the scope of discrimination resulting
from the membership of a minority, signs of this discrimination as well as methods and
strategies of preventing it. The foregoing provision is also applicable towards minority
languages and a regional language. The Minister of Interior and Administration implements
the said provision through the organisation of conferences and trainings for employees of the
public administration in the field of using minority languages. Moreover, in 2008 the Minister
of Interior and Administration announced an open tender offer for the implementation of the
task called “Task aimed at promoting, before commune authorities, the use of a language of a
minority or a regional language as an auxiliary language and using additional traditional
names of places and physiographic objects in a language of a minority or a regional
language”.
Article 14
Cross-border exchange
The Parties undertake:
a) to implement the existing bilateral or multilateral contracts which bind them
75

with countries where the same language is used in an identical or similar form,
or, if it is necessary, to take actions to conclude such contracts, in such a way as to
make favourable conditions for contacts among users of the same language in the
interested countries in the field of culture, education, information, vocational
education and continuing education,
b) for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate or
support the cross-border cooperation, in particular among regional or local
authorities on the territories of which there is used the same language
in an identical or similar form.
The provisions of Article 14 points a and b of the Charter are implemented on the basis of
a number of bilateral contracts which have been concluded between the Republic of Poland
and the countries in which minority languages are used in an identical or a similar form.
Based on the said contracts there was guaranteed the possibility of maintaining contacts
between users of minority languages in the interested countries in the field of culture,
education, information, vocational education and continuing education and also the possibility
of developing the cross-border cooperation. The activities provided in the foregoing contracts
include e.g. the activities connected with the preparation of teaching programmes, textbooks
and didactic aids within the scope of teaching a minority language, literature, culture, history
and geography, the supporting of institutions which carry out publishing activities in minority
languages, exchange of students and the supporting of teachers of minority languages, the
creation of favourable conditions for the preservation of cultural links of people belonging to
minorities with users of the same language living on the territory of the country of the other
Party, the exchange of information concerning systems of education, plans and directions of
their reformation, the support of direct cooperation between schools, in particular in the
border regions, the assurance of methodological help and the organisation of in-service
teacher trainings, the implementation of joint educational and research actions, the support of
direct contacts between social groups and associations such as cultural associations, artistic
unions, the organisation of joint scientific events.
The legal framework of the cooperation of the Republic of Poland and the countries in
which languages of minorities are used in an identical or similar form includes:
Contracts concluded with the Republic of Belarus
- The Treaty between the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Belarus on Good
Neighbourhood and Friendly Cooperation, signed in Warszawa on 23 June 1992 (Official

CONCLUSIONS
The ratification of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is a
confirmation that the Republic of Poland is interested in the preservation and development of
minority languages and a regional language.
Enabling users of minority languages and a regional language to choose provisions of
the Charter to the implementation of which the Republic of Poland has obliged itself proves
that the Polish Government attentively listens to the voices of its citizens who represent
communities using minority languages and a regional language.
The Republic of Poland bases its policy, legislation and practice on the objectives and
rules laid down in Article 7 of the Charter, takes actions aimed at promoting the use of
minority languages and a regional language in public life. People who use languages of
national and ethnic minorities and a regional language are provided with the possibility of
enjoying e.g. the right to use minority languages in relations with local authorities, the right to
introduce additional traditional names of streets, places and physiographic objects in
languages of minorities and in a regional language, the right to learn minority languages and
in such languages, as well as to use the said languages in radio and television. It is also worth
emphasising that every year the Republic of Poland gives financial measures for the
implementation of tasks aimed at preserving and developing minority languages and a
regional language, and also enables users of minority languages to influence matters which
concern them, mainly by the agency of the Joint Commission of the Government and National
and Ethnic Minorities.
For Poland there are still a number of activities left which shall enable people using
minority languages to fully enjoy their rights connected with the language e.g. within the
scope of encouraging the creation of radio stations and television channels in minority
languages and a regional language, ensuring efficient methodological consultancy for teachers
of minority languages and also drawing up a model of the functioning of the Minority
Philology Schools.
