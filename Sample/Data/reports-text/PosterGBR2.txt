KEEPING
QUIET BELONGS
TO THE PAST.

ITâ€™S TIME TO
SPEAK UP!

European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages
XX For a long time minority languages could only be spoken
in the family.
XX Today, the Charter obliges the authorities to ensure that
our language is used everywhere in public again.
XX You too can use our language, with the authorities, in shops,
in hospitals, for family and place names, etc.
XX Have your say!
