SPEAKING
OUR LANGUAGE:
THAT’S WHAT
WE’VE ALWAYS
DONE HERE.

European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages
XX In many families, regional or minority languages have been spoken
for generations.
XX It is therefore natural that we speak our language with our relatives
and friends.
XX Don’t be the first not to pass on the language to your children
after so many centuries!
XX Keep on talking!
