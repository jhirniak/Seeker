LET’S GO GET
OUR LANGUAGE!

European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages
XX The Charter allows us to ask, in our own language,
for oral and written information or services in this language.
XX Even if you don’t get a reply in our language at first, insist on its use
every day. Don’t feel like you’re being a nuisance – you’re helping to
keep our language alive!
XX Don’t let them brush you off!
