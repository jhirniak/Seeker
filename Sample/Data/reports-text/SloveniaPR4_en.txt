Introduction
The Republic of Slovenia signed the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
(hereinafter: the Charter) on 3 July 1997 and ratified it on 19 July 2000. The Charter was published in
the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia (Uradni list RS) on 4 August 2000. When depositing
the instrument of ratification on 4 October 2000, Slovenia stated that the provisions of the Charter
would apply in Slovenia as of 1 January 2001.
The purpose of the Charter is to protect and promote the use of regional and minority languages in
Europe as integral parts of its cultural heritage. In this context, it protects languages which have
traditionally been used by members of ethnic communities in certain parts of the country. The Charter
does not include dialects of the official language of the State nor the languages of immigrants. When
depositing the Charter, the Republic of Slovenia informed the Secretary General of the Council of
Europe that in the sense of the Charter, the Italian and Hungarian languages were regional or minority
languages on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. In accordance with Article 2, paragraph 2 of the
Charter, the Republic of Slovenia applies to these two languages the following paragraphs and subparagraphs referred to in Part III of the Charter:

From Article 8:
for Italian: paragraph 1 a (i), b (i), c (i), d (i), e (iii), f (iii), g, h, i and paragraph 2
for Hungarian: paragraph 1 a (ii), b (ii), c (ii), d (ii), e (iii), f (iii), g, h, i and paragraph 2
 From Article 9:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraph 1 a, b, c, d and paragraph 2 a.
 From Article 10:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraph 1 a (i), b, c, paragraph 2, paragraph 3 a, paragraph 4 and
paragraph 5.
 From Article 11:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraph 1 a (i), e (i), paragraph 2 and paragraph 3.
 From Article 12:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraph 1 a, d, e, f, paragraph 2 and paragraph 3.
 From Article 13:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraph 1 and paragraph 2.
 From Article 14:
for Italian and Hungarian: paragraphs a and b.
In addition, Slovenia informed the Secretary General that the provisions of Article 7, Paragraphs 1 to
4, would apply mutatis mutandis to the Romani language.
The Republic of Slovenia submitted its Initial Periodical Report according to the Charter on 14 March
2002. It was followed by the Second Periodical Report on 13 June 2005 and the Third Periodical
Report on 2 June 2009. The present Fourth Periodical Report of the Republic of Slovenia was
prepared on the basis of contributions from the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of
Slovenia, Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Ministry of Finance,
Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and
Sport, Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of the Interior,
Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Statistical Office of the Republic
of Slovenia, Market Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia and National Education Institute. The
Ministry responsible for local self-government included local self-government bodies in the process of
preparing contributions.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for coordinating the preparation of the report informed
non-governmental organisations at a regular meeting on 12 February 2013. On this occasion, the nongovernmental organisations were also informed that the draft report would be provided to all interested
parties via website for examination and eventual amendments. On 20 February 2013, before the final
process of inter-ministerial coordination, the draft report was published on the website of the Ministry
4

of Foreign Affairs1 with an invitation to interested individuals or groups to submit their proposals. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs received no comments or proposed amendments.
In accordance with the new guidelines for presenting periodical reports (MIN-LANG (2009) 8 of 6
May 2009) the report focuses on the development and modifications made since the Third Periodical
Report (MIN-LANG/PR (2009) 3 of 2 June 2009) and on the Recommendations of the Committee of
Ministers (RecChl(2010) 5 of 26 May 2010), as well as questions posed by the Council of Europe
(MIN-LANG (2011) 7 - Questions referred to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia with a
request for information to be included in its Fourth Periodical Report of 25 May 2011). In areas in
which no changes were made that would require reporting, relevant information can be found in the
previous Third Periodical Report.

The Republic of Slovenia began to carry out a register census of population in 2011. The method of
collecting data is in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No. 763/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on population and housing censuses10. In Slovenia, data
on national affiliation will no longer be collected through a register-based census. The collection of
data on national affiliation is not a mandatory element of a census. An individual may provide data on
nationality when registering or changing residence address, in accordance with Article 7 of the
Residence Registration Act, only when he or she wishes to declare his or her national affiliation.
At its 14th session on 16 September 2010, the National Assembly’s Commission for National
Communities addressed the issue of members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities
under the register-based population census of the Republic of Slovenia in 2011. According to the
decision of the Commission that proposed to the Government of the Republic of Slovenia that it ask
the responsible institutions (in particular the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Slovenian
Government Office for National Minorities and Institute for Ethnic Studies) in cooperation with the
autochthonous national communities to study the possibilities of conducting a research project to
collect data on the ethnic and linguistic affiliation of members of autochthonous national communities
in the Republic of Slovenia (a similar decision was adopted by the Commission on 20 June 2012), the
Slovenian Government Office for National Minorities convened a meeting on 14 April 2011. At this
meeting, it was agreed on the basis of talks and problems with collecting data on national and
linguistic affiliation that a pilot project should be prepared which could be “considered” as preliminary
assessment of the situation, which should be extended to the entire ethnically mixed area.
At the first session of the Government Commission for the National Communities on 28 September
2012, the Commission was informed of the problems of the ethnic and linguistic affiliation of
members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities in the Republic of Slovenia (the second
decision), and ordered the core group to draft a study by the end of November 2012 by stating the
purpose, goals, methodology, research framework and financial framework (the third decision) and
asked representatives of the Slovenian Government to demonstrate the possibilities of financing the
project within programmes in the area of research activity or from European funds.
 Activities in the area of minority protection
Further seminar on the European Charter for regional or minority languages
On 12 May 2011, the Council of Europe Committee of Experts for monitoring the implementation of
the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (the Charter) in conjunction with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the premises of the Ministry, held a one-day seminar to prepare
representatives of the responsible ministries and other national authorities for the fourth monitoring
cycle on the implementation of the Charter. The seminar followed the structure of the Charter by
topic: education, judicial and administrative authorities – public services, media, economic and social
life, Roma. The day before the seminar, the Council of Europe delegation without the presence of
representatives of the Slovenian Government, met representatives of various native speakers in
Slovenia.
Seminar on the implementation of the Framework Convention of the Council of Europe for the
Protection of the National Minorities
In cooperation with the Council of Europe and the Slovenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Government Office for National Minorities held a seminar on the implementation of the Framework
Convention for the Protection of the National Minorities on 21 October 2008. The seminar, which was
attended by representatives of different minority communities, who took an active part in the
discussion, provided an opportunity to exchange opinions on how minority rights are exercised in the
Republic of Slovenia and on the shortcomings, outstanding issues and dilemmas that need to be

addressed by the relevant authorities. It also highlighted the broader meaning of consultations with
representatives of various minority or ethnic groups, civil society and other relevant parties.
Round table on the position of minorities in Slovenia and Slovenes living outside the Republic of
Slovenia
To review achievements in the area of minority protection and conduct a debate on new challenges
that could give a greater emphasis or benefit value added on to minorities in the future, perhaps even
affecting institutions (the reorganisation of national authorities responsible for minority protection),
the Government Office for National Minorities in cooperation with the Office of the Government of
the Republic of Slovenia for Slovenians Abroad, during the chairmanship of the Committee of
Ministers of the Council of Europe, hosted a round table on the position of minorities in Slovenia and
Slovenes living outside the Republic of Slovenia on 16 June 2009 at Brdo pri Kranju. Experts on the
protection of minorities, representatives of the Government and representatives of the national
communities and other interested groups discussed the position of minorities, the difficulties they face
and the challenges in the further regulation of their position.
Agreement on Guaranteeing Special Rights to the Slovene Minority Living in the Republic of Hungary
and the Hungarian National Community in the Republic of Slovenia
The Agreement on Guaranteeing Special Rights to the Slovene Minority Living in the Republic of
Hungary and the Hungarian National Community in the Republic of Slovenia is a bilateral agreement
which is important to both the Hungarian national community living in Slovenia and the Slovenian
minority living in Hungary. On the basis of this Agreement, signed by the two states in 1992, the
Mixed Slovenian-Hungarian Commission meets annually to assess its implementation and makes
recommendations to the respective governments. The Mixed Slovenian-Hungarian Commission met in
November 2009 in Lendava, in June 2011 in Budapest, and in September 2012 in Ljubljana.
The Working Table on Minority Issues active within the Mixed Commission of the Republic of
Slovenia and the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia
On the proposal of the Office of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for Slovenians Abroad, a
meeting on the Working Table on the Minority Issues active within the Mixed Commission of the
Republic of Slovenia and the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia to discuss common
development issues took place on 29 September 2010. Representatives of the Italian national
community were invited to the meeting to propose topics to be discussed at the Working Table.
The first meeting of the Working Table, the aim of which was to agree on topics and procedure, took
place on 27 December 2010 in Koper. The topics that were considered most important for the next
round table discussion on minorities are as follows: continuation of cross-border cooperation; the
visibility and audibility of radio and television programmes; minority education.
The meeting was held in a positive and creative atmosphere; both parties agreed on the agenda of the
ensuing meetings. The Working Table addressing minority issues attempts to overcome old historical
divisions between the two nations; the first meeting has already shown that many common issues and
challenges unite both countries.
The second meeting on 21 January 2011 in Trieste focused on implementing cross-border projects
which improve the situation of the border area and its population. Italy and Slovenia participate in
projects as equal partners that share responsibility for the timely implementation of programmes.
Eventual complications and disagreements should not affect the drawing of funds.
It was further agreed at the meeting that both parties would support quality projects in culture, the
environment, tourism and business that will also include minorities. Both minorities play an important
role in promoting the cooperation.
Priority support was given to those European quality projects of the Cross-border Cooperation
Programme in the 2007–2013 programme period which contribute to good human relations and
present the advantages that result from living in the border area. Projects which emphasise the
activities of minority groups make a special contribution. The Media project may be such an
8

improvement, provided that the administrative requirements are met, since by planning activities in the
area of media reporting, it may contribute to promoting a common media environment in the border
area and to eliminating obstacles to the successful integration of the area. At the meeting, the
Jezik/Lingua project was highlighted as a successful high-quality project in the current financial
perspective. The fact that both minorities are participating in the project and that it is aimed at developing and
promoting the Slovenian and Italian languages in the future is of special value. Also of great importance are
other strategic projects such as ICON– Competitiveness of SMEs through Innovation and
Collaborative Entreneurship, the KRAS - CARSO project – Sustainable Management of Natural
Resources and Territorial Cohesion, and the SIGMA 2 project – Cross-border network for sustainable
management and biodiversity that should result in the development of the border area, a better
atmosphere or better human relations, and thus improve the position of both minorities. Declaration of
the Republic of Slovenia on the Status of National Communities of Members of Nations of the former
Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in the Republic of Slovenia. On 1 February 2011,
by a two-thirds majority, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia approved the Declaration
of the Republic of Slovenia on the Status of the National Communities of Members of Nations of the
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in the Republic of Slovenia. Paragraph 3 of
the Declaration refers to Albanians, Bosniaks, Croats, Macedonians, Montenegrins and Serbs (in
alphabetical order), and recognises their right to cultivate their respective languages, in addition to
other cultural rights of community members.
Solemn celebration of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Department for the Hungarian
Language and Literature at the Faculty of Arts, University of Maribor
On the occasion of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the Department for
the Hungarian Language and Literature at the Faculty of Arts, University of Maribor, a solemn
celebration was held on 26 January 2012, attended by the Ambassador of the Republic of Hungary to
the Republic of Slovenia, the dean of the faculty, leading representatives of the Hungarian national
community in Slovenia, former and current heads of the department, professors and students, who
discussed the establishment of the department, the results achieved over thirty years, joint work,
events and memories. In Slovenia, a course in Hungarian studies is available at the Faculty of Arts in
Maribor. The course requires that graduates acquire a great breadth of knowledge which can be put to
practical use after graduation and enable an adequate response to current linguistic and cultural
challenges and success in the labour market. Graduates are qualified to foster a high level of linguistic
culture in all areas of social and economic activity, including the media, tourism, editing and language
counselling. Future teachers, teachers and expert staff who have already been working in bi-lingual
educational institutions in the Prekmurje region are provided with language training and additional
knowledge training, and deepening of skills and understanding of literature and language.
Signing the agreement on cooperation between the Hungarian national community living in Slovenia
and the Slovenian minority living in Hungary
On the occasion of a visit by Dr Danilo Türk, then president of the Republic of Slovenia, the
agreement on cooperation between the Hungarian national community living in Slovenia and the
Slovenian minority living in Hungary was signed on 8 March 2012 in Hungary. This is a framework
agreement of general importance, the purpose of which is close cooperation between the two
communities. Based on the agreement, bilateral cooperation and agreements between the institutions
of both nationalities should be carried out.
Reorganisation of public administration
Based on the Act Amending the Government of the Republic of Slovenia Act11 and the Act Amending
the Public Administration Act12, the Ministry of the Interior took over the work of the Government

Office for National Minorities of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and related monitoring
and protection of the special rights of the Italian and Hungarian national communities and the Roma
community in Slovenia. On 1 April 2012, the office started to work as the Service for National
Communities of the Ministry of the Interior, to which all the tasks pursuant to the Decision of the
Government of the Republic of Slovenia on the Organisation and Field of Work of the Office of the
Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities13.were transferred. Under the Act
Amending the Government of the Republic of Slovenia Act14 , the competence of the Ministry of the
Interior relating to nationalities was revoked, and pursuant to the transitional provision, these tasks
were assumed by the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia. The Government has
subsequently assessed that for the purposes of carrying out special tasks to implement the
constitutional and statutory provisions relating to the special rights of members of the Italian and
Hungarian national communities and tasks to monitor and provide for the protection of the special
rights of the Roma community living in the Republic of Slovenia, it is necessary to open an
independent government office headed by a state secretary or director. At the time of writing this
report, the process of establishing the independent Service for National Communities has not been
completed.
Agreement on the cooperation of deputies of Italian and Hungarian National Communities with the
Government of the Republic of Slovenia during the 2012-2015 term of office and drafting the
Autochthonous Italian and Hungarian National Communities Act
On 26 January 2012, the deputies of the Italian and Hungarian National Communities, Robert Battelli
and Dr László Göncz, signed an Agreement on the cooperation of the deputies of Italian and
Hungarian National Communities with the Government of the Republic of Slovenia during the 20122015 term of office. The deputies of the Italian and Hungarian National Communities adopted the
principles of the Contract for Slovenia 2012-2015 signed by the following political parties: the
Slovenian Democratic Party, Civic List, Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia, Slovenian
People’s Party and New Slovenia/Christian People's Party, which provides the basis for constructive
cooperation and the above Agreement as its upgrading. The signatories to the Contract agree on the
significance of maintaining the national and cultural identity of the Italian and Hungarian communities
and the specific nature of the ethnically mixed area; therefore, they agree that: the level of special
rights of the national communities is a starting point for their further development; measures to
prevent assimilation in all fields of vital importance for the existence and development of both
national communities, including the promotion of economic and infrastructural development of
ethnically mixed areas, particularly emphasising the creation of new jobs and economic bases for the
two national communities will be taken; special attention is devoted to strengthening the organisations
and institutions, languages and cultures of the national communities and to the autonomy of
autochthonous national communities; a favourable social atmosphere to implement policies relating to
the Italian and Hungarian national communities has been created. For the purposes of providing an
adequate social and political and economic position for the Italian and Hungarian national
communities in Slovenia and maintaining protective measures of positive discrimination and
upgrading them, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia will prepare an umbrella law designed to
protect the Italian and Hungarian national communities.
Agreement on the cooperation of Positive Slovenia, the Social Democrats, Civic List and the
Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia in the Government of the Republic of Slovenia
In the Agreement on the cooperation of Positive Slovenia, the Social Democrats, Civic List and the
Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia in the Government of the Republic of Slovenia signed by
the Coalition Partners on 14 March 2013, the Coalition Partners, in relation to the Italian and
Hungarian national communities in Slovenia, undertake to consider the rights of the members of the
Italian and Hungarian national communities provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia

On 7 March 2013, the Decree on co-financing municipalities in ethnically mixed areas for 2013 and
201484 was adopted. The Decree lays down the purpose of use and the amount for co-financing the
bilingual operation of municipal administrative authorities and bodies and the bilingual operation of
municipal self-governing national communities for 2013 and 2014. Public funds are earmarked for the
bilingual municipal administrative authorities and bodies of the municipalities of Koper, Izola, Piran,
Lendava, Moravske Toplice, Dobrovnik, Šalovci and Hodoš and for the operations of municipal selfgoverning national communities in the aforementioned municipalities. The amount of funds to cofinance the bilingual operation of municipal administrative authorities and bodies and the operation of
municipal self-governing national communities for 2013 and 2014 is to be determined in the budget of
the Republic of Slovenia based on a proposal from the ministry responsible for the Italian and
Hungarian national communities, taking into account proposals on the bilingual operation of
municipal administrative authorities and bodies and the operation of self-governing national
communities in the above municipalities. In determining the amount of funds earmarked to co-finance

 Clarifications ofthe Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers (document RecChL(2010)5
of 26 May 2010) on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in
Slovenia
At the 1085th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies on 25 May 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of
Europe adopted the Recommendation RecChL(2010)5 of the Committee of Ministers on the application of the
European Charter to Regional or Minority Languages in Slovenia. The document recommends to the Slovene
authorities that the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Experts of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages be taken into account and defines five areas to which special attention should
be paid are to be identified.
84

Uradni list RS, no. 20/2013.

Recommendation 1:The Slovenian authorities should “define the areas where German and Croatian
have been traditionally spoken in Slovenia and apply the provisions of Part II to German, Croatian and
Serbian, in co-operation with the native speakers.
The Ministry of Culture commissioned a study entitled ‘Ethnic Vitality of Areas Inhabited by Small
Minority Ethnic Communities and Autochthonous Peoples’ the purpose of which is to determine the
cultural needs and their articulation in areas inhabited by the Kočevje German settlers (Gottscheers),
Serbs in Bela Krajina and Croats near the Croatian border. It focuses on three historical ethnical or
national minorities not recognised by the constitution and legislation, their organisation of associations
and financing, methods of operating and implementing cultural needs in the area of language
education, organising events, lectures and exhibitions, publishing activities, preserving cultural and
natural heritage, tourism and cross-border cooperation. The research should respond to some current
professional dilemmas and questions arising at work in the minority area and referring in particular to
small autochthonous ethnic communities not recognised by the constitution or legislation (i.e. the
problem of the uniform naming of the German-speaking community, the issue of representation for
constitutionally unrecognised communities, the issue of accession to those autochthonous minority
communities which officially do not articulate their cultural needs or requirements imposed on the
state etc.).
The research included the following four areas: the geopolitical and historical context; the
demographic situation; the regulatory framework for state institution activities in the field of culture
for the three selected ethnic communities and autochthonous people; and the articulation of cultural
needs of each of the selected ethnic or national communities.
With regard to the needs of the small autochthonous minority communities, the study established that
they express a need to preserve their local identity; therefore, the new European Financing for 20142020 is aimed at strengthening public infrastructure in these areas to meet the need to protect and
promote cultural diversity85. A new National Programme for Culture is in preparation that devotes
more attention to regional integration than hitherto, which means that on the basis of findings, the said
research on small autochthonous communities should be improved with measures by the Ministry of
Culture to support efforts to maintain specific identities in local environments where these
communities live.
Recommendation 2: The Slovenian authorities should “clarify, in cooperation with the speakers, the
issue of the traditional presence of the Bosnian language in Slovenia”
In 2001, the Government Office for National Minorities requested that the Institute for Ethnic Studies
carry out a study entitled ‘The Situation and Status of Members of the Former Yugoslav Nations in the
Republic of Slovenia’. The purpose of the study was to establish the situation and status of members
of former Yugoslav nations in the Republic of Slovenia. In the context of this study, due to the
political circumstances in the states of the former Yugoslavia, and before the census conducted in
2002, it was proposed to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia , that nationality Bosniak
should be added to nationality answers. After consulting the Institute for Ethnic Studies, the Statistical
Office of the Republic of Slovenia amended the category ‘Bosniak’ as ethnically declared and
‘Bosnian’ as ethnically undeclared. The category ‘Bosniak’ accords with the constitution of the
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina of 1995, which defines three constituent nations: Bosniaks,
Croats and Serbs.
The census category of the Bosnian/Bosniak language as a mother tongue was first used in the 2002
census. Prior to this, census data on ethnic and linguistic affiliation (available since 1921) had not
included this category. In the said censuses, the categorisation of languages which can be indicated as
85

The recognition of German and Croatian as an expression of a cultural asset is dealt with in the clarification in
Part II (Recommendation 4).
20

similar depended on the political climate86 (only Serbian-Croatian in the 1921, 1953 and 1961
censuses); Croatian, Croatian-Serbian, Serbian, Serbian-Croatian in the 1971 and 1991 censuses;
Croatian, Croatian-Serbian, Serbian, Serbian-Croatian together in one group in the 1981 census). The
collapse of Yugoslavia resulted in the independence of national languages.87 The data referred to in the
2002 census show that there are Serbian, Serbian-Croatian, Croatian, Croatian-Serbian, Bosnian,
Bosniak and Montenegrin languages.
In the 2002 population census, 21,542 persons declared themselves Bosniaks, while 74% stated that
the Bosniak language was their mother tongue. This linguistic community can be treated mutatis
mutandis as economic immigrants from other republics of the former Yugoslavia in the period from
the end of the 1960s to the second half of the 1980s (which is reflected in the population density in
bigger industrial locations) while after the collapse of Yugoslavia, they constituted a substantial wave
of political immigrants in the 1990s, because of the wars in some parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Immigration data were not collected on the basis of linguistic affiliation; however, it may be noted that
Bosnia and Herzegovina (source of speakers of the Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian languages), in the
biggest wave of immigration to Slovenia in the period between 1975 and 1982, was by far the largest
source of economic migrants of all the parts of the former Yugoslavia88. In the context of the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the presence of the Bosnian language in the Republic of
Slovenia is considered a result of immigration processes.
With regard to the above, it should be emphasised that the constitutional provisions in Article 14
(equality before the law), Article 61 (expression of national affiliation) and Article 62 (right to use
one’s language and script,) of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia apply to all members of
ethnic groups in Slovenia.
In February 2011, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted by a two-thirds majority
the Declaration of the Republic of Slovenia on the Status of National Communities of Members of
Nations of the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia in the Republic of Slovenia, which
in connection with the above communities specifically highlights the right to self-identification and
self-organisation on an ethnic basis which may enable them to enjoy and develop the culture of their
nation, cultivate the language and script, maintain their history, organise their presence in the public
domain, and in cooperation with members of the majority nation and other national communities,
contribute to the multi-culture life of Slovenia. The Republic of Slovenia not only recognises, but also
promotes such activity and at the same time will endeavour to enforce the legal frameworks to provide
material and other ways to support their action.”
The Association of Cultural Societies of the Constitutive Nations and Nationalities of the Former
Yugoslavia, established in 2006, in the process of adopting the Resolution on the National Programme
for Language Policy 2014-2018 which is still underway, highlighted some comments on the draft text
in the public discussion, which can be summarised under two points: more participation by
representatives of the above linguistic communities in monitoring and forming the linguistic policy of
the Republic of Slovenia and specific measures to develop the relevant mother tongues in the
education system. In drafting the resolution, the proposals will be included mutatis mutandis either in
the national programme or in the operational sub-programme for linguistic education proposed by the
resolution. The final draft resolution outlines three general measures:

linguistic training of public service employees for communication in minority languages;

training translators and interpreters for potentially deficit languages (considering the need for
interpreting of the community)

ensuring public media programmes in the languages of speakers whose mother tongue is not
Slovene and who wish to be covered by public media, but are currently not presented through such
programmes.
All non-governmental and non-profit organisations and individuals with the status of a self-employed
professional in the culture of members of various minority ethnic communities may apply to calls for
applications intended for co-financing cultural projects of various minority ethnic communities in the
Republic of Slovenia carried out by the Public Funds of the Republic of Slovenia for Cultural
Activities. The cultural projects submitted in response to the public call for tenders intended for cofinancing cultural projects in the period 2010-2012 (and were co-financed) by non-governmental
organisations and self-employed professionals, members of the Bosniak community in the Republic of
Slovenia are described in Enclosure 2.
Within the framework of European Territorial Cooperation 2007-2013, Slovenia is implementing
some projects with activities targeting the social inclusion of members of other minorities and the use
of language of other nationalities. As a general rule, the projects are supported with up to 85% cofunding from European funds, while the smaller share (usually 10%) is co-financed from the national
budget. The project Korenine in Bosnia and Drevo in Slovenia is 90% financed by the Swiss
contribution, and carried out by the Bosnian Cultural Union of Slovenia. The aim of the project,
carried out from April 2012 to June 2013, is to reinforce positive attitudes to minority cultures to
improve the social inclusion of young people from immigrant backgrounds. The project offers classes
in mother tongue and culture.
Recommendation 3: The Slovenian authorities should “develop the teaching of the Romani language
and Roma culture at all appropriate stages”
Acts and implementing regulations governing the rights of Roma in education:
- Organisation and Financing of Education Act89;
- Pre-school Institutions Act90;
- Primary School Act91.
In the 2012/2013 school year, 2,109 Roma children were enrolled in primary schools.
Major attention and sources were allocated to developing the education of members of the Roma
community. In this respect, the European Social Fund projects (ESS) should be highlighted: Successful
integration of Roma into education (I and II) and Enhancing social and cultural potentialities in
environments with Roma communities
Successful integration of Roma into education I (2008-2011)
http://www.zveza-romov.si/vzgoja_izobrazevanje,636,0.html
The aim of the project is to develop mechanisms that contribute to the more effective integration of
Roma in pre-school institutions and primary schools and improve the knowledge of Roma culture,
history and identity. The project supported the introduction of Roma assistants who help children
overcome emotional and linguistic barriers and act as a bridge between the pre-school institution and
school and the Roma community. For this purpose, school project teams comprised of both
management and/or expert staff as well as Roma assistants were established. Training was organised
for Roma assistants, who acquired national vocational qualifications at the end of the project. A
quantity of materials on the Romani language, history and culture were developed and the training of
Roma assistants (30) and Roma parents organised. A great deal of practical work has been
successfully carried out in educational institutions. It has been observed that pupils (more than 1000
participated) are attending school more regularly and achieving greater academic success. The project

gained wider repute in Europe; it received a special mention at the competition for 2010 RegioStars
Awards conferred by the European Commission. The project was coordinated by the Union of Roma
of Slovenia; it began on 30 May 2008 and ended on 31 August 2011. The contract value was EUR
1,593,100.
The project Successful integration of Roma in education II (2011-2014) (http://www.projektuvrvi2.si/) started on 1 September 2011 and ends on 31 August 2014. The partnership is being carried
out by the Ljudska univerza Kočevje (Kočevje People's University); the contract value of the project is
EUR 1,675,680. This project helps improve the work carried out in the previous one. The aim is to
attain higher standards of knowledge among Roma pupils in primary schools and the widest
integration possible in secondary education. The most important measures are as follows: providing
further education for Roma assistants, their planned inclusion in school life and work, and preparing
teaching materials and teaching aids for children and pupils.
Under the European Social Fund project Enhancing social and cultural potentialities in environments
with Roma communities 2010-2013 (http://www.khetanes.si/), culturally and linguistically appropriate
teaching aids have been developed for children, teachers and group leaders who come into contact
with Roma children. The project is carried out by seven consortium partners under the auspices of the
Institute for Ethnic Studies. The contract value is EUR 3,562,033.03. The project has the following
objectives:
— to develop innovative and creative forms of educational work in the Roma community, with
special emphasis on pre-school education;
— to organise learning assistance for Roma pupils and students in order to raise the quality of learning
and academic performance, understanding, promote motivation and active independent learning;
— to develop and implement various forms of extra-curricular activity for Roma children, young
people and parents in the Roma community;
— to educate and train teachers, social and other teaching professionals and professionals in nongovernmental organisations for work with Roma children and young people;
— to conduct a spatial and demographic analysis and offer opportunities to develop the learning
environment in areas with Roma communities;
— to encourage and promote transnational cooperation and partnership by analysing foreign examples
of good practice and exchanging knowledge and experience at international level.
In this context, the following activities are underway: Learning of a second language and bilingualism
in pre-school institutions. The objective of the training is to acquire knowledge of learning a second
language and create an encouraging bilingual environment, one that encourages the linguistic
development of children and affects the pre-reading and pre-writing skills of children whose mother
tongue is not Slovene.
One of the innovative elements of the project is the establishment of so-called Romani education
incubators, which can be defined as a comprehensive programme with various forms of work with
Roma children, young people and their parents in their environment, i.e. Roma settlements.
At the end of 2011, the number of participating pre-school institutions and schools was 30; the number
of Roma pre-school children, pupils and students participating in learning assistance, other forms of
educational work and pre-school and extra-curricular activities was 697; the number of persons
involved in learning assistance was 35; the number of pre-school, extra-curricular and other activities
was 35; the number of various forms of professional training was 7; the number of professionals
participating in the training programme was 153.
Twelve trilingual picture books (in Slovene and in the Prekmurje and Dolenjska dialects of Romani)
and three handbooks were published. The noteworthy aspect of these materials is that they provide the
possibility of writing in the dialect with which the children are most familiar (with regard to the
diversity in the Roma community in Slovenia). The purpose of the picture books is to enable reading
and story-telling for children in their mother tongue and to encourage those whose mother tongue is no
23

longer Romani, to learn and use the language. The picture books are accompanied with handbooks (for
different age groups) with examples of activities that can be conducted after reading.
These books resulted in trilingual picture dictionaries (for children aged 2-3, 4-5 and 6-8) containing
basic expressions for understanding the stories; however, they play an important role in everyday
communication. These dictionaries are also available in Slovene, in the Prekmurje and Dolenjska
dialects of Romani, and each page has an empty space that can be completed with words from other
languages. The illustrations for the dictionaries were drawn at creative workshops based on fairytales
that were held in Romani education incubators in Prekmurje and in Murska Sobota Kindergarten.
We organised training (August 2011) for the use of trilingual picture books: 51 professionals in preschool institutions and preliminary schools and Roma assistants attended. The training was organised
in two environments; the content covered topics related to the creation and development of Romani
and the educational use of trilingual picture books. Trilingual picture books were distributed to all preschool institutions and primary schools in which Romani- or foreign-language speaking children are
enrolled.
A grammar of the Prekmurje dialect of the Romani language which includes chapters on phonology,
morphology and syntax is in preparation and is scheduled to be published at the beginning of 2013.
Among the calls for applications for co-financing adult education, general informal adult education
programmes are available for the development of key competences for vulnerable target groups. In
this context, more than 20 different programmes are underway for the Roma; they are carried out by
various adult education institutions which operate in different parts of the country and have acquired
public funds for this purpose. The Roma population has participated in other joint programmes and
activities in the field of adult education, such as study activities, information consultancy activity in
adult education (mobile consultancy service for the Roma), independent learning, the activities of
Lifelong Learning Centres, literacy programmes (Training for Life Success programmes) including
information literacy.
Recommendation 4: The Slovenian authorities should take proactive measures to reduce the gap
between the legislative framework and practical implementation regarding the use of Hungarian and
Italian in the provision of public services, in economic and social activities, as well as in relations with
local branches of State administration.
The drafting of the Autochthonous Italian and Hungarian National Communities Act is necessary
especially because of the gap between the constitutional standards for the exercise of the rights of
autochthonous national communities in the Republic of Slovenia and the implementation of these
provisions. In addition to the aforementioned, the Act should: upgrade the current legal standards
protecting autochthonous national communities, so that no change in constitutional provisions is
needed; eliminate any legal gaps and inconsistencies and upgrade certain legal commitments to protect
autochthonous national communities; and integrate, in one place, all the important legal commitments
that currently protect autochthonous national communities.
Recommendation 5: The Slovenian authorities should “intensify measures to raise public awareness of
regional or minority languages in mainstream education and in the mass media”.
Education for members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities is an integral part of the
general education system in the Republic of Slovenia. Both models, which differ, enrich the national
identity of individual children in pre-school institutions and pupils or students at school, and develop
linguistic competence and activities in intercultural dialogue. The two regional units of the National
Education Institute of the Republic of Slovenia in Koper and Murska Sobota, based on the annual
work plan of the Institute, offer expert development and advisory assistance and various forms of
training to education institutions in both regions where national communities live. Because of the
specific features of both institute units and having knowledge of, and sensitivity to, the circumstances
24

as well as the linguistic competence of advisers who work in both units, they offer an opportunity for
professional cooperation with schools and institutions on both sides of the Italian-Slovenian and
Hungarian-Slovenian borders, and also offer professional assistance to the Slovenian education system
in Italy and Hungary in accordance with international agreements on cooperation with the Ministry of
Education, Science and Sport.
In the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part of Istria, two school models are being introduced in
the primary and secondary schools: i.e. the SI programme (S-Slovene and I-Italian, adapted syllabus
for schools providing instruction in Slovene schools in the ethnically mixed area) and the IS
programme (I-Italian and S-Slovene, for schools providing instruction in Italian). Italian is the first
language in the IS-programme and the second language in the SI-programme. Slovene is the first
language in the SI-programme and the second language in the IS-programme. Teaching Italian and
Slovene as first and second languages in the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part of Istria is
compulsory in primary and school education. The first language is compulsory for national
examinations for the completion of primary school, at vocational or the general matura examinations,
while the second language may be chosen as an optional subject in general and vocational matura
examinations.
Some parts of the Slovenian part of Istria are not ethnically mixed. In these areas, Italian is considered
the second foreign language. In primary schools in the Slovenian part of Istria which are not bound by
the SI-programme, since they are not in ethnically mixed areas, Italian is introduced as an optional
extra-curricular activity and optional subject. Italian classes are slightly less demanding. Italian, as the
second foreign language, has been introduced in all primary schools of the Koper regional unit which
are close to the border with neighbouring Italy. Pupils from these areas who participate in further
secondary education in the ethnically mixed areas of the Slovenian part of Istria continue to learn
Italian; however, they may choose between advanced and beginners’ courses.
Italian may be used in other regions of Slovenia as a second or third foreign language in primary and
secondary schools.
All advisers connected with schools providing instruction in Italian and schools providing instruction
in Slovene in their professional work in the Slovenian part of Istria raise the awareness of teachers and
the general public of the regional or minority language in mainstream education.
The Koper/Capodistria Regional RTV centre monitors and reports regularly on activities carried out
within pre-school institutions and schools in the ethnically mixed areas of the Slovenian part of Istria
and is responsible for promoting intercultural events in this region.
Hungarian has been an element in the Slovenian education system in the form of various school
subjects:

in bilingual schools in the ethnically mixed area of the Prekmurje region, it is taught as a
mother tongue and second language;

in schools outside the ethnically mixed area of the Prekmurje region where Slovene is the
language of instruction, it may be included as a second foreign language in the final part of the
primary school syllabus;

on the basis of the curriculum, Hungarian may be taught as an optional subject in the final
years of primary schools outside the ethnically mixed area.
The Hungarian language as an optional subject in the third triad of primary school will be provided for
the first time in the 2012/13 school year outside the ethnically mixed area,, at the Prežihov Voranc
Primary School in Bistrica. The inclusion of Hungarian as an elective subject in primary schools that
provide instruction in Slovene was also presented in the national media and on Hungarian television.
The Murska Sobota Regional Unit operates as adviser to the Hungarian participants in the substantive
part of preparing and holding the Petőfi Award for Hungarian language proficiency for pupils in
bilingual primary schools and students of secondary bilingual schools in Lendava.
25

The regional media, among which Nepujsag weekly and the regional Hungarian RTV Centre
Lendava/Lendva play special roles, monitor and inform the public of activities in bilingual pre-school
institutions, primary schools and bilingual secondary schools. At the same time, Murska Sobota
Regional Unit responds to their invitations to cooperate.
The Republic of Slovenia provides for the dissemination of information about minority languages and
mutual understanding between all linguistic groups in the country and additionally encourages the
media to pursue the same objectives through public tenders.
In compliance with constitutional and legislative provisions, freedom of expression is guaranteed to
everyone in the Republic of Slovenia, while media activity is based on the autonomy and
independence of editors and editorial boards and journalists.
Article 7 of the Mass Media Act guarantees the freedom to disseminate and receive programmes from
other countries within the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. In accordance with the fourth
paragraph of Article 5 of the Mass Media Act, all media founded or registered in the Republic of
Slovenia may broadcast programming in a foreign language on condition that a translation into
Slovene is provided. However, the translation into Slovene is not necessary if the programming in a
foreign language is primarily intended for readers, listeners or viewers of any other foreign language
group.
As presented in detail in the response to question 7.1.d, the Republic of Slovenia contributes to media
budget funds for satisfying the public interest in the field of mass media, with account being taken of
minority media or media disseminating in minority languages.
A special mission in this area is undertaken (which, in accordance with the Mass Media Act, is in the
public and cultural interest of the Republic of Slovenia) by public radio and television and so-called
programmes of special importance. In accordance with the Mass Media Act and the Radiotelevizija
Slovenija Act (ZRTVS-1), the broadcasting of radio and television programmes of the Italian and
Hungarian national communities, radio and television broadcasts for the Roma ethnic community and
for foreign audiences are defined as public service activities which Radiotelevizija Slovenija is obliged
to carry out. In its programming, Radiotelevizija Slovenija must, inter alia, support the dissemination
of knowledge of other cultures that are represented in Slovenia and their representatives.
With the adoption of the National Programme of Measures for Roma for the Period 2010–2015,
activities aimed at raising public awareness of Roma culture and combating discrimination of the
Roma became an essential part of the national programme, since one of its objectives is "raising public
awareness of the existence, culture, customs and traditions of the Roma community members, and
raising awareness of the minority population on their rights and duties as citizens of the Republic of
Slovenia". More information on the programme is provided in Part II of the Report.

Part II
 Clarifications of the Recommendations of the Committee of Experts on the application of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by Slovenia
In the third monitoring cycle, the Committee of Experts adopted a report on the application of the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Slovenia (document ECRML (2010) 5 of 26
May 2010) in which it highlighted several framework recommendations.
“The Committee of Experts strongly recommends to the Slovenian authorities that they define, in cooperation with the speakers, areas where German and Croatian have traditionally been spoken in
Slovenia and apply the provisions of Part II to German and Croatian.”
The response is included in the clarification to Recommendation 4.
“The Committee of Experts supports the Slovenian authorities cooperation with Serbian speakers in
implementing the provisions of Part II of the Charter to the Serbian language.”
The response is included in the clarification to Recommendation 4.
“The Committee of Experts calls on the Slovenian authorities to provide information, in cooperation
with the speakers, on the traditional presence of the Bosnian language in Slovenia”
A comprehensive response is provided in the response to Recommendation 2 of the Committee of
Ministers on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in Slovenia.
“The Committee of Experts supports the Slovenian authorities’ recognition in the domestic legal order
of the German and Croatian languages as expressions of cultural wealth."
In general, it should be pointed out that the constitutional provisions (Articles 14, 61 and 62) apply to
the members of all ethnic groups in the Republic of Slovenia.
In connection with the above recommendations, the former Government Office for National
Minorities requested that Institute for Ethnic Studies carry out a study entitled National/ethnic vitality
of members of the Serbian, Croatian and German national communities in the area of their historical
settlement’, which has not been completed. Some additional site inspections are envisaged. Based on
the working meeting with the representatives, it can be assumed that the majority of speakers of the
Croatian and Serbian languages do not wish to have special minority status.
With a view to defining the current situation of the German speakers (dialect of Kočevje Germans) in
the Kočevje region, the decision of their leadership to move, after the occupation of the Kingdom of
Yugoslavia in 1941, from their traditional settlement area which lay within the Italian occupation area,
was very important. Between May and October 1941 more than 95% of German speakers, or 12,147
people, agreed to move. The move took place from 14 November 1941 to 22 January 1942.
Additionally, post-war Yugoslavia moved those speakers who had collaborated with the occupying
forces during the war.92 Today, we can hardly speak of the presence of a traditional German national
community, since, according to the population census, more than half of the speakers whose mother
tongue is German were born outside Slovenia; only a very small number of speakers remained in the
traditional settlement area.

All non-governmental and non-profit organisations and individuals with the status of self-employed
professionals in the field of culture of the members of the various minority ethnic communities may
apply to public calls for tenders intended for co-financing the cultural projects of various minority
ethnic communities in the Republic of Slovenia implemented by the Public Funds of the Republic of
Slovenia for Cultural Activities. Information on individual minority ethnic communities:

No association registered in the area of traditional settlement of the Serbian community has
responded to a call for tenders; however, the community members are included in various associations
that bring together the members of the Serbian community (mostly from Novo mesto) The cultural
projects which were submitted in response to a public call for tenders intended for co-financing
cultural projects in the period 2010-2012 (and were co-financed) by non-governmental organisations
and self-employed professionals, members of the Serbian community in the Republic of Slovenia, are
described in Enclosure 1;

Cultural projects which were submitted in response to a public call for tenders intended for cofinancing cultural projects in the period 2010-2012 (and were co-financed) by non-governmental
organisations and self-employed professionals, members of the Croatian community in the Republic of
Slovenia, are described in Enclosure 3;

Non-governmental organisations and self-employed professionals who are members of the
German-speaking group were able to respond to the call for tenders for co-financing cultural projects
of minority ethnic communities in 1991; however, since 2008, they have responded, in addition to the
aforementioned call, to the call for tenders intended for co-financing cultural projects of the
programme intended for members of the German-speaking group in the Republic of Slovenia in
accordance with the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the
Government of the Republic of Austria; most co-financing is for language projects: publishing
bulletins of these associations by means of which they inform the public of their activities; publishing
bilingual works; organising various workshops for children and adults to improve their knowledge of
German (and the dialect of Kočevje Germans (Gottscheerish)); giving choral recitals and holding
literary evenings in their mother tongue etc; the co-financed cultural projects of the German-speaking
ethnic group in the 2010-2012 period are shown in Enclosrue 4.
“The Committee of Experts supports the Slovenian authorities taking resolute action to promote the
German and Croatian languages in co-operation with the speakers.”
In 2011, with a view to promoting foreign language learning, the publishing house of the National
Education Institute, which is obliged by law to perform activities required to provide education,
published a folding leaflet Foreign Languages describing the options for primary school grades 7, 8
and 9 in English, German, French, Spanish, Russian, Croatian, Serbian, Macedonian and Latin.
In 2010, the National Education Institute of the Republic of Slovenia started the project Enriched
Foreign Language Learning, which is co-financed by the European Union from the European Social
Fund and the ministry responsible for education. The objectives of the project were to enrich foreign
language learning by including a foreign teacher/native speaker in the learning process within and
outside foreign language classes; to upgrade the quality of foreign language classes with innovative
approaches made possible by including a foreign teacher in the school curricula or the participation of
a foreign teacher or German programme teacher in the learning process.
In Slovenia, a German Language Diploma examination has been available on the basis of a bilateral
agreement since 1998. Preparations for the examinations are carried out by native German teachers
and Slovene teachers of German. In 2012/13, nine grammar schools (gimnazije) had the status of a
‘German Language Diploma’ school.
Additionally, regarding the prevention of family violence, leaflets were published in Italian,
Hungarian, Croatian and German languages. Leaflets as assistance to coordinators working in this
field were also translated into the Romani language and Braille. Translations of leaflets were
published on the website

“The Committee of Experts calls on the Slovenian authorities to take concrete measures, in
cooperation with the speakers, to provide appropriate forms of teaching German as a minority
language.”
German is taught as a first foreign or second foreign language in the school system. In the 2011/2012
school year, 5% of the overall school population were learning German as the first foreign language
and 7% of primary school population and 32% of the secondary school population were taking
German as a second foreign language.

German as a compulsory second foreign language has been introduced at 122 primary schools (out of
142 selected schools) since 2008. The status of the compulsory second foreign language in last three
years of the primary school will be eliminated in 2013; only the status of the optional subject (with
regard to the amendment to the Primary School Act93) will remain.
Under the project The introduction of a foreign language and language/intercultural awareness in the
first education period of the primary school, German was introduced in the first three years of primary
school in 11 primary schools in the period 2008-2012.
Additional classes in German and culture for immigrant children: the Ministry of Education and Sport
has been co-financing learning and teaching German as a mother tongue and culture for Germanspeaking immigrant children and young people for several years:

2010/11: 46 children,

2011/12: 46 children,

2012/13: 60 children.
Secondary School: German is taught as the first, second or third foreign language. In general, a
reduction in the number of pupils learning German as the first foreign language (TJ1) is evident.

An expert adviser on German from the Central Agency for Schools Abroad (Zentralstelle fuer das
Auslandsschulwesen) has worked at the Slovenian National Education Institute for several years. His
task is in particular to coordinate and carry out preparations and examinations for the German
Language Diploma – Level II (DSD II). Eight grammar schools are participating in the programme;
interest in it has increased (in 2011, 85 diplomas in 2012, 135 diplomas).
“The Committee of Experts calls on the Slovenian authorities to take concrete measures, in
cooperation with the speakers, to provide appropriate forms of teaching Croatian as a minority
language.”
Croatian has the status of a second foreign language in the school system and is taught in the 7 th, 8th
and 9th grades of primary school. In the 2012/2013 school year, Croatian was taught in 11 primary
schools; it included 0.04 % of the primary school population.
Great emphasis has been placed on financing and providing conditions for implementing optional
subjects. Regarding the Croatian language, problems exist concerning the appropriate qualifications of
teachers (former teachers of the Serbo-Croatian language; currently, at the Faculty of Arts, the study
programme under South Slavic Studies at the first level) or the lack of teachers qualified to teach
individual languages (Croatian and Serbian).
The Croatian language is taught as an optional subject in the Slovenian school system in the third triad
of primary school. In the 2010/2011 school year, 65 pupils at six primary schools took Croatian as an
optional subject (the primary schools of France Prešeren in Črenšovci, Dušan Flis in Hoče, Center
Novo mesto, Janko Glažer in Ruše, Šmartno pri Litiji.
In the 2011/2012 school year, 63 pupils at seven primary schools took Croatian as an optional subject:

Additional classes in Croatian and culture for Croatian-speaking immigrant children: in the 2011/2012
school year, the Croatia authorities provided a teacher for additional classes in the Croatian language
and culture, which included 62 pupils and students in the following schools:
1. Lendava Bilingual Primary School
2. Lendava Bilingual Secondary School
3. Angela Besednjaka Primary School in Maribor
4. Maribor Grammar School II
5. Šalek Primary school
These classes will continue in the 2012/13 school year.
“The Committee of Experts calls on the Slovenian authorities to take measures
– to ensure the full implementation of the Strategy for the Education of Roma in the Republic of
Slovenia of 2004;
– to promote awareness and acceptance of the Romani language and culture as an integral part of
Slovenia's cultural wealth, to include this promotion among the objectives of national education,
and to encourage the mass media to pursue the same objective.”
The Strategy for the Education of Roma in the Republic of Slovenia of 2004 was prepared in cooperation with the Roma Association of Slovenia and included many measures. The Strategy was very
successful; in 2011, it was amended with proposals for solutions and actions which would enable the
more successful participation of children of members of the Roma national community in the
education system from pre-school institutions to university and post-graduate education; in addition to
forms of formal education system, forms of informal education, the work of non-governmental
organisations etc. are also promoted.
 The project Successful integration of Roma in education I (2008-2011) and II (2011-2014) develops
mechanisms that contribute to the more effective integration of Roma in pre-school institutions and
primary schools and improve theknowledge of Roma culture, history and identity. The project
supported the introduction of Roma assistants; project teams (including Roma assistants) were
established Training was organised for Roma assistants, who acquired national vocational
qualifications at the end of the project.
 The European Regional Development Fund resources help implement the training of professionals
in pre-school institutions and schools, which also includes training within the activities of Learning of
31

a second language and bilingual pre-school institutions in the project Enhancing social and cultural
potential in environments with Roma communities 2010-2013 led by the Institute for Ethnic Studies.
Although the project focuses on the Romani language as a mother tongue, it is possible to transfer the
content of training to other situations where professionals meet children whose mother tongue is not
Slovene. Training is intended for all professionals in pre-school institutions and schools that come into
contact with children speaking foreign languages.
 The National Education Institute operates a network of teachers who teach Roma children, within
which they exchange experience and examples of good practice.
 Numerous materials on the Romani language, history and culture were developed, and the training
of Roma assistants and Roma parents organised within projects of the Roma Union of Slovenia.
 A project for developing methods (and materials) for teaching Slovene as a foreign language was
financed.
 Several projects on intercultural dialogue have been carried out.
 Romani culture was developed as a subject, which pupils may opt for in the last three-year cycle of
primary school.
 The education of adult Roma has been financed.
 Among young people, young Roma intellectuals promote the importance of general knowledge and
Romani culture through the Roma academic club.
 In kindergarten units with Roma children have a more favourable children-staff ratio (in the first
age group, four children per one adult; in the second age group, seven children per one adult).
 More favourable norms have been set in primary schools for establishing classes attended by at least
three Roma children (21 pupils) than for ordinary classes.
 In the 1st grade of primary school, two teachers spend more time in classes attended by Roma
children.
 A primary school may employ an additional teacher or school counsellor who is available to Roma
pupils for educational or other assistance.
 A school attended by more than 45 Roma pupils can be provided with two additional teaching staff.
 Scholarships are granted to Roma pupils.
 The Roma Union of Slovenia and non-governmental organisations financed by the Ministry of
Culture organised several symposiums promoting Roma culture and language.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing new programmes for the 2014-2020 development perspective to
complement current programmes, whereby the staff capacity of non-governmental organisations in
which members of the minorities operate was strengthened. The members of ethnic minorities have
become more aware; therefore, they need attention and understanding from public institutions in order
to work together in harmony and balance. The programmes are connected with the objectives of the
National Programme of Culture, Slovenia's Development Strategy and with the possibility of drawing
on European funds in the 2014-2020 period.
Roma non-governmental and non-profit organisations and individuals with the status of self-employed
professionals in the field of culture may respond annually to the call for tenders for the selection of
Roma community cultural projects to be carried out by the Ministry of Culture. These projects cover
various areas: publishing (publishing of various Roma newspapers, bulletins, video and audio
recordings, books, dictionaries), information (websites and radio broadcasts), events, projects for
language preservation (seminars, camps, round tables), activities of various cultural groups, training
(workshops) etc. These projects contribute to preserving and developing Roma culture, and their
linguistic and cultural identity. The co-financed cultural projects of the Roma community in Slovenia
in the 2010-2012 period are shown in Enclosure 5.
The Republic of Slovenia promotes and financially supports activities aimed at raising public
awareness of the Romani culture and language, and at promoting the informational and publishing
activities of the Roma community. Roma programming is still regularly broadcast by the national
radio and television station (Naše Poti – Amare Droma on radio and So Vakeres? – Kaj govoriš? on
television); the ROMIC Roma information centre has been assigned a radio frequency and is
broadcasting successfully.
32

In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the activities of Roma associations were financed through public tenders of
the Service for National Communities of the Ministry of the Interior (a former Office of the
Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities) to support the functioning of Roma
associations and local radio broadcasts in the following fields:
- promoting and strengthening the identity of community members;
- the integration and cooperation of different parts of the community;
- awareness-raising and combating intolerance and discrimination, and
- informative activities;
and local radio broadcasts, with a view to encouraging the preparation and broadcasting of Roma
programmes focusing on:
- a balanced presentation of Romani themes from different aspects (from the point of view of
the Roma, the majority population, national organisations, state, local community,
international community, expert public);
- the preservation and consolidation of the ethnic identity of the Roma, their language and
culture;
- the inclusion of the Roma in preparing and broadcasting programming;
- influencing the majority population to make them more tolerant of Roma and their values and
encouraging the Roma to respect the values of the majority population.
Among the co-financing activities of the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion,
the Slovenian Ministry of Work, Family and Social Affairs supported the project of the 2010 Roma
Information Centre – supported by Radio Študent in the setting up of the centre and its initial
operation. The purpose of the project, its orientations and bases focused on: raising awareness among
the Roma community members and the broader public of the status of the Roma community in
Slovenia in various fields; preparing and broadcasting 6 radio programmes and establishing an
information-education-cultural-social centre in the urban environment of the Slovenian capital;
supporting the start-up operation, and the establishment of some essential platforms for the centre’s
work, such as the website; media coverage of some issues concerning the Roma community; a
presentation fold-out; assistance with establishing a relationship with public institutions; assistance
with commencing the networking with potential partnership organisations; establishing guidelines for
possible operations; increasing knowledge of Romani themes at Radio Študent in the current policy
editorial office and services associated with the project.
The objectives of promoting activities to preserve the Romani language and Roma culture and
encourage the organisation of cultural, information, publishing and other activities important for
developing the Roma community are integral parts of the programme of the umbrella organisation of
the Roma community, the Roma Community Council of the Republic of Slovenia.
A public awareness-raising campaign under a joint programme of the Council of Europe and the
European Commission aimed at combating stereotypes and prejudices towards Roma, Dosta!
Osvobodimo se predsodkov, spoznajmo Rome! (Dosta! Go beyond prejudice; meet the Roma) was
most intensively conducted in late 2008 and in 2009 and 201094. The economic crisis and the
amendment of the 2011 national budget resulted in a reduction in the number of awareness-raising
94

Since the campaign’s official launch at the end of 2008, numerous activities have been organised, namely: the
presence of the campaign in the media, providing information to the media about the campaign, the campaign
held at particular important events (International Roma Day, Festival of Roma culture Romano Čhon / the Roma
Month, Volunteer Day, Cultural Bazaar, Week of Cultures in Novo mesto), the filming of the documentary Sanje
črno bele mavrice (Dreams of a Black-and-White Rainbow) and its premiere in the Slovenian Ethnographic
Museum (22 April 2010); cooperation with the Society of Allies for Soft Landing from Krško on organising
creative workshops for children and youth in Roma settlements in the municipality of Krško; a summer camp in
Grosuplje intended for Roma and non-Roma children to meet; a meeting of children from Bela Krajina and
Prekmurje at Pušči in Murska Sobota – presentation of Romani culture and society; a summer camp in Metlika
(presentation of the activities organised by the children’s club Veselo srce (A Happy Heart) in cooperation with
the Dosta campaign), etc.
33

activities; however, the distribution of campaign materials continued: leaflets, CDs (Music Beyond
Prejudice: Romani variations on the European Anthem), a DVD of the film Sanje črno bele mavrice
(Dreams of a Black-and-White Rainbow) etc.
With the adoption of the National Programme of Measures for Roma for the Period 2010–2015, the
activities aimed at raising public awareness of Romani culture and the fight against discrimination of
the Roma also became an essential part of the national programme, since one of its objectives is
"raising public awareness of the existence, culture, customs and traditions of Roma community
members, and raising awareness of the minority population of Roma about their rights and duites as
citizens of the Republic of Slovenia". This involves three concrete measures: (1) activities aimed at
preventing discrimination and eliminating prejudice and stereotypes concerning the Roma; (2) the
training of Roma community representatives in self-managed local community councils (Roma
councillors), associations and other organisations (Roma activists): (3) the training of public
administration and judicial personnel whose work brings them into contact with members of the Roma
community. The responsible authorities are the Service for National Communities of the Ministry of
the Interior for measures (1) and (3), and Roma community organisations for measure (2).
Within the framework of European Territorial Cooperation 2007-2013, Slovenia is implementing
some projects with activities that target the social inclusion of members of other minorities and the
Roma community, promote tolerance, solidarity, and intercultural dialogue etc., while some projects
also comprise activities that specifically include the aspect of using the language of other nationalities
or the Roma community. The projects are usually supported with up to 85% co-funding from
European funds, while the smaller share (usually 10%) is co-financed from the national budget.
The project entitled Rokic DROM was implemented from 2010 to 2012 and co-financed from the
Slovenia-Croatia Operational Programme 2007–2013. It involved the cooperation of the following
Slovenian project partners: ‘Misija *S’ – Association for the Sustainable Development of Pomurje,
ROMANO PEJTAUŠAGO - the Romano pejtaušago Kamenci society, the municipality of Črešnovci
and the University of Ljubljana. The project has the following targets:








to establish a cross-border Romani cultural-tourist-information infrastructure (culturalinformation centre in Kamenci) to develop and implement Romani social
entrepreneurial and employment programmes in culture and tourism;
to organise motivational workshops for the Roma on the theme: The heritage of the
past = the Romani capital for the future;
to provide computer courses for the Roma population;
to train the Roma for the implementation of pilot software packages for tourists;
to enrich the tourist cross-border offer with a new and innovative, integral Romani
cultural and tourist product;
to contribute to overcoming negative stereotypes and prejudice among most of the
general majority population towards the Roma through the planned media promotion
of positive events in the life and work of the Roma,.

The Social Integration of the Roma project was co-financed from the EEA Financial Mechanism and
the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2004–2009, and implemented by the Association for Developing
Voluntary Work Novo Mesto. Its purpose was to improve the social inclusion of the Roma, their
empowerment and the promotion of tolerance, solidarity and intercultural dialogue. To this end, a
daily centre for Roma children was established. A significant part of the programme also focused on
providing learning assistance and on learning the Slovenian language. The project was completed on
31 January 2012.

34

The Skupaj – Skupa project, 90% financed by the Swiss contribution, is a continuation of the Social
integration of the Roma project. The project, which concluded in January 2012, was implemented by
the Association for Developing Voluntary Work Novo Mesto. Its attained objectives comprise the
establishment of a day centre at the Šmihel Roma settlement, a motion for a legislative solution to
eliminate the social and cultural inequalities of Roma children when they join the school system, and
the publication of fairytales in the Romani and Slovenian languages.

OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
The Government of the Republic of Slovenia received a list of questions (document MIN-LANG
(2011) 7 of 25 May 2011) with a request to incorporate the answers in the 4 th periodical report on the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Information on
individual questions according to Article 7 of the Charter is provided below.
"What measures have been taken by the Slovenian authorities to define, in cooperation and on the
basis of transparent consultations with the speakers, areas where German and Croatian have been
traditionally spoken in Slovenia and to apply the provisions of Part II to German and Croatian?"
The study National/ethnic vitality of members of the Serbian, Croatian and German national
communities in the area of their historical settlement’ is ongoing. Some additional site inspections are
envisaged.
"What measures have been taken to cooperate with Serbian speakers in the implementation of the
provisions of Part II of the Charter to the Serbian language?"
The Serbian language is taught as an optional subject in the Slovenian school system in the third triad
of primary school. In the 2010/2011 school year, 27 pupils at two primary schools opted to learn
Serbian: the primary schools of Gustav Šilih in Velenje and Anton Ukmar in Koper.
In 2009, the National Education Institute of the Republic of Slovenia conducted a survey on the
interest of pupils in the Serbian language as an optional subject. All primary schools in Slovenia
received a questionnaire on pupils’ interest and the qualifications of teachers employed at the schools.
The survey indicated that interest in the subject existed in 26 Slovenian primary schools; however,
only in six primary schools was the interest was sufficiently great for the subject to be offered as an
optional subject, and only three of these schools had a qualified teacher. In accordance with Slovenian
legislation, the offer of options is the free decision of individual schools. Next, coordination was
arranged between Slovenian and Serbian officials for the additional education of teachers and
preparation of a relevant textbook.
In the 2012/13 school year, an additional class in Serbian language and culture is being offered for the
first time for Serbian-speaking immigrant children at Livada Primary School in Ljubljana. The class is
attended by 35 pupils and is co-financed by the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport of
the Republic of Slovenia.
With a view to promoting foreign language learning, in 2011 the publishing house of the National
Education Institute published a folding leaflet Foreign Languages' showing the options for primary
school grades 7- 9, including the Serbian language.
"Please provide information on the traditional presence of the Bosnian language in Slovenia. What
measures have been taken on the basis of the findings of two earlier studies dealing inter alia with the
status of Bosnian in Slovenia (The situation and status of members of the former Yugoslav nations in
the Republic of Slovenia’ and ‘Perception of the Slovene Integration Policy)?"

35

In reference to this question, mention should again be made of the fact that the Republic of Slovenia
has already reported that the Bosnian language in Slovenia is a language of immigrants. More detailed
information on the Bosnian language is provided in the response to Recommendation 2 of the
Committee of Ministers on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages by Slovenia.
Both studies mentioned in the above question, in particular the study Perception of the Slovene
Integration Policy, are critical of the situation in the area of integration, and draw attention to the
weaknesses of integration measures, which, however, is not directly associated with the measures
relating to the traditional presence and use of the Bosnian language in the Republic of Slovenia in light
of the Charter. The integrated measures are intended for citizens of third countries, regardless of their
ethnic origin, mother tongue or numbers, and are based on the fundamental principle that integration is
a dynamic two-way process of mutual adjustment of immigrants and the nationals of the host State.
7.1.a
"What measures have been taken to recognise, in the domestic legal order, the German and Croatian
languages?"
The Ministry of Culture is drafting the Resolution on the National Programme for Language Policy
2014-2018, which will take into account the full socio-linguistic picture of the Republic of Slovenia,
as well as of Slovenian migrant workers/Slovenians living in neighbouring countries or abroad. In this
context, general measures will be prepared that target minority language communities; furthermore, a
detailed scheme of measures for individual languages listed in the above Recommendations will be
adopted in the sub-programme for language learning which evolves from the Resolution. The drafting
of the sub-programme is expected to start in 2015.
7.1.b
"Please report on whether the Slovenian authorities have started a dialogue with speakers of Italian
and the local authorities of the three municipalities concerned on the issue of a progressive extension
of the scope of the protection currently afforded to the Italian language in the “ethnically-mixed” area
to other areas of these three municipalities where there is a stable presence of speakers of Italian."
In 2012, the Koper Administrative Unit was requested by the Commission of the National Assembly
for the National Communities to complete a questionnaire on the implementation of the national
community language.
The administrative units in Izola, Koper and Piran established that their efforts to comply with the
prescribed obligations would be much more efficient and effective if public service employees
improved, through education or training, their professional knowledge of administrative terminology
in Italian. Public employees lack such knowledge and, therefore, are not sufficiently qualified to
translate concrete administrative acts. Furthermore, implementing this obligation would require
financial resources to be allocated under the item of material costs. As a solution, the administrative
units proposed that a translator for a specific territorial area be employed to carry out these tasks for all
state administration bodies.
In December 2012, on the initiative of the Community of Italians, the Coordinating Advisory
Committee to the Head of the Koper Administrative Unit discussed the effective implementation of
this obligation by individual bodies and arrived at conclusions similar to those of the administrative
units. They expressed the common position that the prescribed forms of any applications in the
Slovenian language which are published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia should
also be published in the languages of both national communities.
7.1.c

36

"What resolute action has been taken by the Slovenian authorities to promote the German and Croatian
languages (in particular by increasing financial support) in cooperation with the speakers?"
The answer is the same as that to the question under 7.1.a. The information on financing cultural
projects of Croatian and German speaking ethnic communities in Slovenia, which was implemented
on the basis of a public tender issued by the Republic of Slovenia Public Fund for Cultural Activities,
is provided in Enclosures 3 and 4.
7.1.d
"What measures have been taken to facilitate and/or encourage the use of German and Croatian in
public life, in particular in the broadcast media (for example, by broadcasting programmes in these
languages on local radio and local television?"
In compliance with the constitutional and legislative provisions, freedom of expression of thought is
guaranteed to everyone in the Republic of Slovenia, while media activity is based on the autonomy of
editors or editorial boards and journalists. Article 7 of the Mass Media Act guarantees the freedom to
disseminate and receive programmes broadcast from other countries in the territory of the Republic of
Slovenia. In accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 5 of the Mass Media Act, all media
founded or registered in the Republic of Slovenia may disseminate programming in a foreign language
on condition that a translation into the Slovenian language is provided. However, a translation into
Slovenian is not necessary if the programming in a foreign language is primarily intended for
readers, listeners or viewers of any other foreign language group.
In accordance with Article 4 of the Mass Media Act, the Republic of Slovenia, by providing funds
from the state budget, supports the mass media in the creation and dissemination of programme
content important for the exercising of the public interest in mass media. One element of public
interest is the assurance of plurality and diversification, which includes cultural plurality relating to the
equal and diverse presentation and expression (meaning active and passive approach) of various
cultural and social groups (including national and ethnic groups). All the mass media in the Republic
of Slovenia may apply for a call for the project tender relating to the co-financing of programme
content, whereas no restrictions apply to the language in which the programme content is to be
disseminated. On the contrary, the enabling of the exercise of the right to public information for
minorities, or dissemination in the language of such minorities, is defined as a special criterion or
criterion for assessing the projects in the case of co-financing the programming of radio and television
programme services with the status of local, regional or student radio or television programme
services or non-profit radio or television programme services (i.e. special programme services), which,
in accordance with Article 82, in conjunction with Article 4, of the Mass Media Act, are allocated
special funds from the state budget in an amount corresponding to three per cent of the RTV Slovenija
licence fee on an annual basis. This implies that an individual radio or television programme service
disseminating programme content in the language of a national community is more likely to win the
tender.
Furthermore, since 1990, through the ministry responsible for culture, the Republic of Slovenia has
been systematically implementing a wide range of measures focusing on national and ethnic
minorities, including those not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. In
accordance with Articles 14, 61 and 62 of the Constitution, the members of all national communities
in the Republic of Slovenia are guaranteed individual rights for the protection of their national,
language and cultural features. The ministry responsible for culture continuously pursues a policy to
protect the cultural rights of all special social groups, which includes all ethnic minorities, including
the national communities recognised under the Constitution, the Roma community, immigrants and
various other minority communities not recognised under the Constitution, among which particular
attention is paid to German-speaking settlers in Kočevje. The minority policy is implemented through
the following programmes:
(1) a special programme for the protection of special cultural identities (currently implemented by the
Public Fund of the Republic of Slovenia for Cultural Activities);
37

(2) an integration programme aimed at ensuring access to cultural goods and services and access to
creativity for members of special social groups in a way that enables the principle of equal
opportunities to be applied according to quality criteria.
The objectives of protecting the cultural rights of minorities and other social groups are attained not
only through financial, but also through organisational (expert assistance and counselling to all
providers operating in this field, the head of sector’s open-door day for minority artists, etc.) and
normative instruments (mediation proceedings, legal counselling services with awareness raising, etc.)
With respect to encouraging the use of German language, it is necessary to point out that the rights of
the German-speaking community in Slovenia are appropriately regulated by the bilateral Agreement
between the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and the Government of the Republic of Austria
on Cooperation in Culture, Education and Science.
7.1.e
"What measures have been taken to maintain and develop links, in the fields covered by this Charter,
within all the five linguistic groups concerned, as well as to establish cultural relations between them?"
In all public calls for tenders intended for co-financing the cultural projects of various minority ethnic
communities, the cooperation of various minority ethnic groups is a project assessment criterion,
which also promotes the cooperation of all communities in the area of culture.
7.1.f
"What concrete measures have been taken, in cooperation with the speakers, to provide appropriate
forms of teaching German as a minority language (in particular in the municipalities of Apače,
Maribor, Dolenjske Toplice and Semič and including bilingual pre-school education)?"
The answer to this question is provided in the response to Recommendation 6 of the Committee of
Ministers on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by Slovenia.
"What concrete measures have been taken, in cooperation with the speakers, to provide appropriate
forms of teaching Croatian as a minority language (in Bela Krajina and including pre-school
education)?"
The answer to this question is provided in the response to Recommendation 7 of the Committee of
Ministers on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by Slovenia.
7.1.h
"What measures have been taken to promote research on German and Croatian at universities or
equivalent institutions?"
German is taught at two universities (in Ljubljana and Maribor), while Croatian is part of the study
programme of South Slavic Studies in the Department of Slavistics at the Faculty of Arts at Ljubljana
University. Universities are independent in the provision and development of programmes.
7.1.i
"What measures have been taken to promote appropriate types of transnational exchange in the fields
covered by the Charter for the German and Croatian languages?"
In order to promote the use of German in Slovenia, the Agreement between the Government of the
Republic of Slovenia and the Government of the Republic of Austria on cooperation in culture,
education and science for the 2008-2012 period was signed.
The project entitled BeRi was implemented from 2010 to 2012 and co-financed as part of the SloveniaCroatia Operational Programme 2007–2013. Miran Jarc Library in Novo Mesto was included in the
project as a Slovenian project partner. The project has the following objectives:
38







to organise language courses in Slovenian/Croatian in the cross-border area (SI-CRO):
the courses were intended for citizens, business people, cultural and scientific workers,
members of Slovenian and Croatian societies, and were adapted for the visually
impaired; in Slovenia, the courses were held at the premises of Miran Jarc Library in
Novo Mesto;
to raise awareness among children about tolerance between cultures and language
knowledge;
to organise events as part of cross-border cultural cooperation through the exchange of
cultural content;
to reach an agreement on Knjige brez potnega lista (Books without Passports) and the
organisation of a round table on cross-border book loans; this is an attempt to make
inter-library loans easier for the residents of the two countries and to address the issue
of cross-border lending of library collections of two libraries with the cooperation of
national, regional and local institutions.

In general, through school, university and research projects many links have been established between
Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Croatia (e.g. via mobile programmes under Cmepius).
7.3.
"What measures have been taken to address the problem of negative attitudes towards the Italianspeakers?"
On Tuesday, 28 February 2012, the 1st session of the Commission of the National Assembly for the
National Communities was held. Under item 2 of the agenda (AOB), the Commission took the
following decision:
"The Commission for the National Communities is appalled to note an increasing number of hostile
speeches in various online forums, which have recently exposed in particular the Hungarian and
Italian national communities. The Commission therefore condemns any such form of communication
that is discriminatory and leads to the encouragement of national inequality, and incites hatred or
intolerance. Therefore, it calls upon all who publicly encourage and provoke intolerance of other
nationalities to comply consistently with Article 63 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia."
All forms of publicly expressed hatred and intolerance directed against the Italian and Hungarian
national communities and the Roma community were also condemned by the former Government
Office for National Minorities, which urged all parties to stand together and combat national hatred
and intolerance (communication published on the website of the former Slovenian Government Office
for
National
Minorities

"What measures have been taken to raise the awareness of the general public in mainstream education,
notably in curricula, teaching materials and teacher training, regarding the traditional presence of the
Hungarian, Italian, German, Croatian and Romani languages?"
A great deal of material has been developed for foreign language learning, but the Council of Experts
for General Education has approved only textbooks. The catalogues of textbooks for primary and
secondary schools are available at https://soca1.mss.edus.si/Trubar/Javno/default.aspx.
Teacher’s education is provided through the Catalogue of Continuous Professional Training, projects
(recently through ESF projects), the Education Institute (study groups) etc.
The measures that have been adopted with a view to raising public awareness in the area of general
education about the presence of the Hungarian language and culture are included in:
the curricula for the Slovenian language as a mother tongue (primary school,
secondary general and technical education);

40

the curricula for the Slovenian language as a second language (in bi-lingual primary
schools in the ethnically mixed area of the Prekmurje region);
the curricula for the Hungarian language as an optional subject in the final triad of
primary school (in schools outside the ethnically mixed area of the Prekmurje region).
The National Education Institute of the Republic of Slovenia, Regional Unit Murska Sobota, provides
support and assistance to professional staff in bi-lingual education institutions through the planning
and implementation of the following activities:
- professional support provided to teachers in bi-lingual schools in the selection of didactic and
teaching materials; support to teachers/authors in developing teaching materials for the Hungarian and
Slovenian languages as the second language in primary schools;
- regional professional meetings of head-teachers of pre-school institutions, primary schools, primary
schools with adapted programmes, student residence halls and secondary schools (topical subjects,
development planning, international cooperation), 5 meetings per calendar year;
- professional meetings of head-teachers of bi-lingual institutions, with an emphasis on topical
themes; in the 2010/11 school year, two in-class observations of teaching were carried out in bi-lingual
primary schools, with an emphasis on the observation of the language of instruction and analysis of
experience in the classroom; in cooperation with the Task Force for the Education of Ethnicities,
professional meetings of head-teachers (in December every calendar year) are organised to prepare the
proposal for teaching materials and provide translations of teaching materials for bi-lingual school
needs (funds provided by the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport);
- class monitoring by primary school head-teachers in terms of introducing a flexible syllabus and
contemporary 2009/10 teaching approaches, the cross-curricular integration of subjects (2010/11,
2011/12), developing and improving reading standards (2011/12, 2012/13);
- study groups, study groups of Hungarian 1 and Hungarian 2 in a primary school and a study group
for Hungarian 1 and Hungarian 2 in a secondary school;
- providing counselling to professional staff, parents and other interested groups with a view to
promoting and implementing intercultural dialogue;
- regional consultations for professional staff of primary and secondary schools in the Murska
Sobota regional unit during preparations for the new school year; contents: Cross-curricular
Integration of Topics, ICT in Classes; August 2010; Examination and Assessment of Knowledge,
August 2011; Reading Literacy, August 2012. All events were attended by teachers of bilingual
primary and secondary schools and professional staff from bilingual institutions, who participated
through their presentation of examples of good practice;
- with a view to improving efficiency in teaching and introducing novelties in the education process,
the professional staff of bi-lingual kindergartens, primary and secondary schools underwent the
following training in 2011: (1) Introduction of updated curricula in general secondary schools, 8-hour
seminar; (2) Drama in Education, 24-hour seminar; (3) Language training, 24-hour seminar;
- in the 2011/12 school year and with the support of the home country, the Republic of Hungary, the
following events were organised in Hungary for professional staff at pre-school institutions, primary
and secondary schools: (1) Summer seminar, 12-hour seminar; (2) Field work in Hungary, 12-hour
seminar;
- cooperation with various minority and other institutions in Slovenia and Hungary in implementing
activities to support and raise awareness of the presence of the Hungarian language and culture.
In the 2008/09 school year, bilingual primary schools carried out the project Observation of teaching
in bilingual primary schools in the ethnically mixed area of Prekmurje. The purpose was to determine
how different models for implementing bilingual education, as defined in the Instructions for the
Implementation of the 9-Year Bilingual Primary School Programme, enable the acquisition of
knowledge and development of communication skills of pupils in the Slovenian and Hungarian
languages. The report on the bilingual teaching observation was presented to head-teachers of
bilingual primary schools and at a press conference in June 2011. Based on the results of the
observation, the head-teachers and teachers underwent training on 29 and 30 August 2011.

41

The Hungarian language/ESP project entitled E-competences of teachers in bilingual schools
(administered by the Institute for Culture of the Hungarian National Community with its partners)
aims at developing e-language competences in Hungarian, the development of e-content, the
development and upgrading of the teaching of Hungarian through the use of information
communication technologies (ICT), and forms of motivation to learn Hungarian and ICT culture. The
project is administered by the Institute for Culture of the Hungarian National Community and 12
consortium partners (bilingual schools, faculties, the National Education Institute of the Republic of
Slovenia). It commenced on 1 October 2011 and concludes on 31 August 2013; its value is to EUR
1,000,000. By the conclusion of the project, e-learning and teacher training materials will have been
created.
The measures adopted with a view to raising public awareness in the area of general education on the
presence of the Italian language and culture are included in:
- the curricula for the Slovenian language as the first and second languages (primary school,
secondary general and technical education) also in the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part
of Istra);
- the curricula for the Italian language as the first language (primary school, secondary general and
technical education, with Italian as the language of instruction in the ethnically mixed area of the
Slovenian part of Istra);
- the curricula for the Italian language as the second language (primary school, secondary general
and technical education in the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part of Istra);
- the curricula for the Italian language as the second language (primary school, secondary general
and technical education outside the ethnically mixed area);
The curricula, which were developed over several years (2008-2012), comply fully with the guidelines
and recommendations of the Common European Framework language, the Lisbon Declaration, and
other European documents. Special attention is paid to the development of intercultural ability, which
is reflected in the intercultural content and new approaches to teaching and learning the languages in
all their roles, with an emphasis on raising awareness of minority languages.
The activities to raise public awareness of the presence of the minority language carried out in the
teaching practice by Regional Unit Koper under the Slovenian National Education Institute, comprise:
- the introduction of intercultural content and a new approach in newly approved textbooks for
the Italian language, which raise awareness of the presence of a foreign culture in Slovenia
and encourage a positive attitude to the culture concerned (e.g.: Textbook Avventura.is for the
teaching of Italian as the second language in grades 7- 9 in 2010);
- the development of various common publications for language teachers which are aimed at
developing and evaluating intercultural ability in projects implemented under the Slovenian
National Education Institute (publication of teaching practice examples, reflexion);
- the introduction of European Language Portfolios, validated by the Commission of the
Council of Europe, during the instruction of the Slovenian, Italian and other foreign languages
in primary and secondary schools; providing assistance to teachers in raising their pupils’ and
students’ awareness of the presence and co-existence of languages, and learning about their
own identity in a multilingual country;
- providing support to head-teachers and teachers in developing intercultural communication
and intercultural exchanges:
- face-to-face, at regular meetings of head-teachers, study meetings and other trainings,
- at a distance through social networks (portal sio.si, online classroom, etc.);
- cooperation with various minority and other institutions in Slovenia and Italy in implementing
projects to raise awareness of the presence of the minority languages and culture (e.g. project
S.P.In, CROMO, etc);
- the development and implementation of various forms of education and continuous
professional training for teachers in schools with Italian as the language of instruction
(summer seminar in the Republic of Italy, a seminar of the Italian language and culture in
cooperation with the education adviser and the Consulate-General of the Republic of Italy in
42

-

Koper; seminars on the Italian language as part of the cooperation with the Italian Institute of
Culture in Ljubljana);
expert meetings of head-teachers of kindergartens, primary and secondary schools with Italian
as the language of instruction in the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part of Istra on
specific topics (the provision of textbooks and teaching aids imported from the Republic of
Italy or the financing of translations/creation of textbooks through the Ministry of Education,
Science, Culture and Sport).

Teaching materials for the Romani language were developed within the framework of many projects;
more detailed information is provided in the response to Recommendation 3 of the Committee of
Ministers and in the last report of the Committee of Experts on the application of the European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages by Slovenia. The optional subject ‘Roma culture’ is taught within
9-year primary social science education in grades 7-9, which enables pupils to learn about Roma
history, Roma culture as a way of life and about Romani cultural creativity past and present, and the
development of an ability and sensitivity to understand the ways of life of various national
communities that co-exist in the same area. The curriculum for grade 8 focuses on learning the
Romani language and covers various themes.
German is the language of instruction as a first or second foreign language in primary and secondary
education programmes. For this purpose, appropriate curricula and textbooks have been approved. The
National Education Institute performs training for teachers of German as a foreign language. The
training is included among the cheduled seminars and study groups, and from 2008 to 2011, formed
part of the introduction of the compulsory second foreign language in a primary school with teachers
of German language being a large majority. German in the Slovenian education system is defined as
the language of neighbours (the official language of the Republic of Austria) and a foreign language
with major cultural, economic and historical importance in Slovenia and Europe.
The Croatian language is taught as an optional subject in the Slovenian school system in the third triad
of primary school.
An intercultural model is being introduced for all other languages. It is has been developed by a
sectoral group of advisers for foreign and mother languages at the Slovenian National Education
Institute.
"What measures have been taken to raise the awareness of the general public in the mass media
(including mainstream journalist training) regarding the traditional presence of the Hungarian, Italian,
German, Croatian and Romani languages?"
As already noted in the response to question 7.1.d, funds from the national budget are provided for
individual programme content of the media which is in public interest, including, as already presented
in detail, content that facilitates the exercise of the right to public information and to information for
national communities, the Roma community and other minority communities.
In this regard, the most important role is played by public radio and television, which as public
services provide (Article 3 of the Radio And Television Corporation Of Slovenia Act (hereinafter: the
ZRTVS-1)):
- one radio and television channel each for the autochthonous Italian and Hungarian ethnic
communities;
- radio and television broadcasts for the Roma ethnic community;
- radio and television channels for the foreign public.
In all of its programmes, not only those for minority communities, Radiotelevizija Slovenija also
ensures (Article 4 of the ZRTVS-1):
- credible and impartial information broadcasts, whereby it provides comprehensive information on
political events at home and in neighbouring countries, important events in other European countries,
43

especially Member States of the European Union, and important world topics, such that the content
broadcast objectively provides information to Slovenian citizens, Slovenians around the world,
members of the Slovenian ethnic minorities in Italy, Austria and Hungary, the autochthonous Italian
and Hungarian ethnic communities in Slovenia and the Roma community in Slovenia;
- fulfilment of the constitutional rights of the Hungarian and Italian ethnic communities regarding
public information via public radio and television, and promotes ties between the ethnic communities
and their mother countries and the incorporation of cultural and other achievements of the Italian and
Hungarian nations in ethnic community channels;
- in accordance with international treaties and in cooperation with the public radio and television
broadcasting corporations of neighbouring and other countries, supports the creation and development
of cross-border radio and television projects;
- supports the dissemination of knowledge about other cultures that are represented in Slovenia and
about their representatives.
The Ministry of Culture is preparing new programmes for the 2014-2020 development perspective to
complement the current programmes that we have implemented and through which we strengthened
the staff capacity of the non-governmental organisations in which members of the minorities operate.
The programmes are related to the objectives of the National Programme of Culture, Slovenia's
Development Strategy, and with the possibility of drawing on European funds in the 2014-2020
period.
7.4.
"What consultation with the five linguistic groups concerned has been envisaged by the Slovenian
authorities for the preparation of the next periodical report on the Charter?"
Since 1990, the ministry responsible for culture has been systematically implementing a wide range of
measures focusing on minority communities, including those not explicitly mentioned in the
Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. In accordance with Articles 14, 61 and 62 of the
Constitution, the members of all minority communities are guaranteed individual rights for the
protection of their national, language and cultural features. The Ministry of Culture pursues a policy to
protect the cultural rights of all special social groups, including all ethnic minorities, national
communities recognised under the Constitution, the Roma community, immigrants and various other
minority communities not recognised by the Constitution, among which particular attention is paid to
German-speaking settlers in Kočevje, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. The
ministry’s policy is complemented by measures to combat multiple discrimination, with particular
attention being paid to underage members of minorities, children with special needs, elderly members
of minorities, women members of minorities, etc. The objectives of protecting the cultural rights of
minorities and other social groups are attained not only through financial but also by organisational
means (expert assistance and counselling to all providers operating in the minority area, the open-door
day for minority artists of the head of the sector, etc) and normative instruments (mediation
proceedings, legal counselling services with awareness raising etc.).
A working draft of the present report was published on the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
as the authority responsible for its preparation. Upon its publication, interested individuals and groups
were invited to submit supplements.
"What measures have been taken to set up mechanisms with a view to consulting the relevant
organisations representing the German and Croatian languages when establishing a structured policy
to maintain and promote these languages?"
See the response to question under 7.1.a.
7.5.
"What measures have been taken to make the teaching of Romani more generally available and to
develop a scheme for the training of teachers who would be able to teach Romani?"
44

A wide range of materials for teaching Romani is available, including books in Romani, Romani
grammars, and professional staff have undergone substantial training. The National Education Institute
operates a network of teachers teaching Roma children and exchanging experience and examples of
good practice.
See the responses to Recommendation 3 of the Committee of Ministers and the last report of the
Committee of Experts on the application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
by Slovenia.
"What measures have been taken to pursue further the codification of the Romani dialects present in
Slovenia?"
In accordance with the Strategy for the Education of the Roma in the Republic of Slovenia, the
standardisation of the Romani language is being carried out to provide the basis for teaching this
language. Romani grammar books and dictionaries have been written. Students can take Romani
culture as an optional subject in the last three years of primary school.
"What measures have been taken to harmonise the level of protection of all Romani-speakers?"
In the Republic of Slovenia, the concept of differing levels of protection of the rights of various
Romani speakers is not relevant, since their rights are protected equally. No law, regulation or any
other measure distinguishes between levels of protection for the rights of the Romani-speaking
community; on the contrary, all measures relating to protecting and preserving the Romani language,
culture and identity of the Roma community apply equally to the entire Romani-speaking community.
Furthermore, the Roma Community Act95 stipulates in Article 4, paragraph 3, that "the Republic of
Slovenia shall encourage the maintenance and development of the Romani language and culture,
information and publishing activities of the Roma community"; however, it does not provide for
distinctions between different Romani-speaking communities.
"What measures have been taken:
 to ensure full implementation of the ‘Strategy for Education of Roma in the Republic of
Slovenia’ of 2004?
 to promote awareness and acceptance of the Romani language and culture as an integral part
of Slovenia's cultural wealth, to include this promotion among the objectives of national
education, and to encourage the mass media to pursue the same objective?"
See the answer in the response to the last Recommendation of the Committee of Experts on the
application of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by Slovenia.

Part III
Article 8
EDUCATION
ITALIAN AND HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITIES
As a result of historical and other circumstances, Slovenia developed two different models of
education for members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities. In the ethnically mixed
area of the Slovenian part of Istra, Italian is also the language of instruction in schools.96 The
Prekmurje region introduced a bilingual model of education. 97
The Italian and Hungarian national communities and their members in Slovenia have the right to
education and schooling in their respective languages. The acts and implementing regulations
governing the education and schooling rights of the Italian and Hungarian communities are as follows:
- Organisation and Financing of Education Act98;
- Pre-school Institutions Act99;
- Primary School Act100;
- Gimnazije Act101;
- Vocational Education Act102;
- Act Regulating the Exercise of the Special Rights of Members of the Italian and Hungarian Ethnic
Communities in the Field of Education103;
- Rules on norms and standards for the implementation of the elementary school programme in
bilingual primary schools and primary schools with Italian as the language of instruction104;
- Rules on criteria and standards for secondary schools with Italian as the language of instruction105;
- Rules on criteria for the assessment of the material costs of secondary schools delivering instruction
in Italian 106 ;
- Rules on criteria and standards for bi-lingual secondary schools107;
- Rules on criteria for the assessment of the material costs of bi-lingual secondary schools108;
- Rules defining the field of education of teachers in nine-year bilingual primary schools and nine-year
primary schools with Italian as the language of instruction109;
- Rules on testing the knowledge of the language of instruction in ethnically mixed areas110.
96

In the ethnically mixed area of the Slovenian part of Istra, education in Italian developed as a result of the
situation upon the signing of the London Memorandum in 1954, when schools with Italian as the language of
instruction existed de facto and de jure in this area. The Treaty of Osimo, signed between Yugoslavia and Italy,
summarised and consolidated all international obligations assumed by the two countries by that time. As a
successor state to the former SFRY, Slovenia also succeeded to the Osimo Treaty and thus to all agreements on
minority education relating to the Italian minority in Slovenia.
97
After World War II, initially, there was a similar system of separate schools in Prekmurje, but the members of
the Hungarian national community did not enrol their children in schools with Hungarian as the language of
instruction in sufficient numbers. Therefore, an agreement was concluded with the Hungarian self-governing
community to introduce a bilingual education model which also included all children of Slovenian nationality
and in fact expanded the knowledge of Hungarian to the entire population of the bilingual area.

Secondary vocational education is carried out by the Pietro Coppo Secondary School, where students
may take courses to qualify for occupations such as economics clerk, mechanical engineering
technician, gastronomy technician, salesperson, computer operator, gastronomist/hotel manager,
administrative assistant, car repairer, and metal shaper-toolmaker. Lendava Bilingual Secondary
School carries out the gimnazija (general upper secondary school) programme; in addition, students
may also take other courses to qualify as economics clerk, mechanical engineering technician, shop
assistant, gastronomist/hotel manager, mechanic, mechanical fitter, stove fitter/ceramic tiler, and
industrial mechanic.
The Hungarian language is provided as an option for students is in several schools: at Gimnazija
Murska Sobota (general upper secondary school) and at the Bilingual Secondary School in Lendava,
the Economic School in Murska Sobota, Secondary Vocational and Technical School, the Secondary
48

Medical School in Murska Sobota and at Gimnazija Franca Miklošiča Ljutomer.
Furthermore, in general, vocational and technical secondary education, 42 state-approved education
programmes (28 announced and 14 expiring) with instruction in the language of the national
community, or with bilingual instruction, were carried out in the ethnically mixed area in the 2011/12
school year.111 Of these, 12 announced and 8 expiring programmes (a total of 20) were intended for
instruction in Italian, while 16 announced and 6 expiring programmes (a total of 22) were intended for
bilingual instruction:
- secondary vocational education: 6 programmes – and additionally 8 expiring programmes –
(a total of 14) were intended for Italian language instruction, while 9 programmes – and
additionally 6 expiring programmes – (a total of 15) were intended for bilingual instruction;
- secondary technical education: 1 to be carried out in Italian as the language of instruction, 2
offering bilingual instruction;
- vocational and technical education: 3 to be carried out in Italian as the language of
instruction, 3 offering bilingual instruction;
- general secondary education: 1 to be carried out in Italian as the language of instruction, 1
offering bilingual instruction;
- matura course: 1 to be carried out in Italian as the language of instruction, 1 offering
bilingual instruction;
Since the 2008/2009 school year, the free borrowing of textbooks from the textbook fund has been
made possible for all primary school pupils (grades 1-9). In secondary schools, textbook funds are
optional; students pay a borrowing fee which must not exceed one third of the price of the textbook
paid by the school.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport provides funds for the preparation of, and
subsidies for, textbooks for the education of the Italian and Hungarian national communities, in
accordance with the Act Regulating the Exercise of the Special Rights of Members of the Italian and
Hungarian Ethnic Communities in the Field of Education112, the Rules on the Procedures for
Implementing the Budget of the Republic of Slovenia 113 and in accordance with the annual plan for
textbooks or within budgetary constraints. Pursuant to Article 26 of the Act Regulating the Exercise of
the Special Rights of Members of the Italian and Hungarian Ethnic Communities in the Field of
Education, the said Ministry provides subsidies by ensuring funding from the state budget for the
preparation of textbooks and by subsidising textbook prices to an amount that ensures that the average
price of textbooks for individual grades is comparable to the price of textbooks in the Slovenian
language for the same grade.
In agreement with the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, the Task Force for the Education of
Ethnicities within the National Education Institute prepares the selection of textbooks for each school
year and, based on the offer of publishers, carries out coordination with teachers engaged in the
education of ethnic groups, and decides on the final selection of textbooks, serving as a basis for the
coordination and conclusion of contracts with the publishers.
The call for co-financing adult education includes a series of programmes for various adult groups,
offering minority language education or training in different regions. Study club activities and a
programme for learning Hungarian and Italian for adults still continue, as well as other programmes
for the development of key competences or basic capabilities, such as state-approved special education
111

In the 2011/12, there were 28 announced and 14 expiring (a total of 42) state-approved education programmes
with instruction in the language of the national community, or with bilingual instruction, in the ethnically mixed
area. The expiring programmes are listed as those in which enrolment in the first year of the 2011/2012 school
year was no longer possible; enrolment was possible only in higher years (programmes were replaced by new
ones).

programmes for adults (literacy programmes: reading and writing skills and computer literacy); the
programmes are supported through tenders from ESF funds.
An advisory function is carried out by the units of the National Education Institute. The Institute,
which is tasked with development and advisory activities, also provides education professionals from
within the national communities for pre-school institutions and schools with Italian as the language of
instruction and bilingual pre-school institutions and schools.
On the basis of bilateral agreements, both neighbouring countries concerned appoint an advisor for
Italian and Hungarian, respectively. The advisor works within the National Education Institute, which
provides adequate premises and technical assistance. The advisor is tasked with the following
responsibilities:
 cooperation with expert institutions of the country concerned;
 advisory and expert assistance to teachers, with an emphasis on teaching students’ mother tongue
and its use in fostering their national culture;
 organisation of seminars and other in-service training activities for teachers;
 cooperation on planning and organising and on attracting lecturers for seminars on pre-school,
primary school and secondary school education organised by the National Education Institute of
the Republic of Slovenia;
 informing teachers of seminars held in their countries of origin and coordinating these seminars
between the institutions with Italian as the language of instruction and bilingual institutions;
 cooperation and organisation of in-class observation for professionals working at institutions with
Italian as the language of instruction and bilingual institutions in their countries of origin;
 acquainting teachers with new textbooks, teaching aids and literature from their countries of origin
and providing them with suitable material;
 cooperation and the establishment of links between schools and the exchange of pupils and
students from both sides of the border;
 cooperation on organising and guiding excursions and other activities intended for secondary
school students and pupils of schools with Italian as the language of instruction or bilingual
schools.
Further education and training of education professionals is carried out in accordance with the Rules
on in-service training of education professionals (Uradni list RS, no. 64/04). A catalogue of
programmes is published every year from which teachers and other professionals select a programme
according to their own requirements and wishes.
In implementing the mission of the bilingual school, the continuous modernisation of training
programmes is still necessary, in particular in terms of modernising the methods and contents of
bilingual instruction. The ESP project E-competences of teachers in bilingual schools aims at
developing language e-competences in Hungarian, developing e-contents, developing and upgrading
the teaching of the Hungarian language through the use of information communication technologies
(ICT), forms of motivation to learn Hungarian and ICT culture. The project is administered by the
Institute for Culture of the Hungarian National Community with 12 consortium partners (bilingual
schools, faculties, the National Education Institute of the Republic of Slovenia). It commenced on 1
October 2011 and concludes on 31 August 2013; its value is EUR 1,000,000.
In compliance with bilateral documents, members of national communities can study at secondary
schools and universities in their countries of origin, where in-service training of teachers is also
provided. Secondary school students, as well as university students and teaching staff, may apply for a
scholarship during their studies or professional training. Furthermore, on the basis of bilateral
documents, special care is devoted to the school population. With a view to promoting the languages
of minorities and their culture, special expert field trips, open-air schools, various language schools are
organised in the home country. The minority education provided by home countries receives special
logistic support, such as the procurement of textbooks and teaching aids.
50

As regards the recruitment of teaching staff, the Act Regulating the Exercise of the Special Rights of
Members of the Italian and Hungarian Ethnic Communities in the Field of Education stipulates that
upbringing and education in pre-school institutions and schools with instruction in Italian is to be
carried out by professionals with a good command of Italian as the language of instruction. In
bilingual pre-school institutions and schools, upbringing and education is carried out by professionals
with a good command of both languages of instruction.
In accordance with the said Act, a professional is deemed to have a good command of Italian as the
language of instruction if he/she has completed primary and secondary school prgrammes with Italian
as the language of instruction or if he/she acquired the prescribed education in Italian. A professional
is deemed to have a good command of Hungarian as the language of instruction if he/she completed
the programme of a bilingual secondary school, or the optional subject of the Hungarian language at
secondary school or the optional subject of the Hungarian language at high-school or university level,
and acquired the prescribed education in the Slovenian and Hungarian languages. An employee who
does not meet these conditions may demonstrate a good command of the language of instruction by
passing an examination of their command of the language concerned.
The Government of the Republic of Slovenia received a list of questions (document MIN-LANG
(2011) 7 of 25 May 2011) with a request to incorporate the answers in the 4 th periodical report on the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Information on
individual questions according to Article 8 of the Charter is provided below.
8.1.h
"Which measures have been taken to find a solution to the problem of a temporary shortage of
Hungarian teachers due to a significant number of retirements?"
In the case of a shortage of suitable staff, the Act Regulating the Exercise of the Special Rights of
Members of the Italian and Hungarian Ethnic Communities in the Field of Education also envisages
the possibility of employing foreign teachers. If no candidate fulfilling the conditions required for a
qualified staff member applies for a vacancy, the pre-school institution or school may employ a
visiting foreign teacher for a maximum period of two years, in compliance with the conditions laid
down in the Organisation and Financing of Education Act. During this time, the employed staff
member must learn the Slovenian language and his/her employment contract may be renewed for not
more than two years.
"Please report on the progress of monitoring bilingual education in Hungarian."
The National Education Institution has launched a two-year test project entitled Teaching literacy in
the Slovenian and Hungarian languages in bilingual primary schools for the period from 1 September
2012 to 3 October 2014. Since the test project was launched only recently, no report on its progress is
available yet.
8.1.e (iii)
"What is the situation regarding the recognition of degrees in subjects such as pharmacy for Italian
speakers?"
Professional qualifications or professional titles are recognised in accordance with the principle of
non-discrimination, and in this context the same rules apply to Italian or other language speakers.
As a successor of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slovenia adhered to the
bilateral agreement between the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of
Italy on Mutual Recognition of Certificates and Degrees, signed by the two countries in 1983; in 1995,
the two countries additionally signed the Memorandum of Understanding on Mutual Recognition of

51

Slovenian and Italian Degrees and Professional Titles. Professional titles in pharmacy are recognised
by a competent university by a speedy procedure.

Article 10
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES
–
ITALIAN AND HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITIES
The Basic Constitutional Charter on the Sovereignty and Independence of the Republic of Slovenia, in
Chapter III, stipulates that: "The Italian and Hungarian national communities in the Republic of
Slovenia and their members shall be guaranteed all the rights provided for in the Constitution of the
Republic of Slovenia and international agreements." The rights of the national communities are
defined in the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, in particular in Articles 5, 11 and 64. The
rights to use additional official languages and other rights in the areas of municipalities where the
autochthonous national communities live are regulated by individual acts, such as the Police
Organisation and Work Act (Article 80, paragraph 1) and the Tasks and Powers of the Police Act
(Article 19), the Criminal Procedure Act, the Criminal Code, the State Administration Act, the General
Administrative Procedure Act, the Decree on administrative operations, the Civil Servants Act, and a
number of others.
Where a party is a member of the national community, Article 62, paragraph 2, of the General
Administrative Procedure Act stipulates that in the area of local communities where administrative
authorities conduct business in the Slovenian language and also in the Italian or Hungarian languages
as official languages, administrative procedures are conducted in both the Slovenian language and the
language of the national community if a party files a request in this language, on the basis of which
proceedings are initiated, or at the request of a party at any time during the proceedings. If the official
does not speak the language of the member of the national community, the costs of an interpreter are
borne by the authority.
The Slovenian language is the official language outside bilingual areas; a person who is a member of
the Italian or Hungarian autochthonous national community and lives in a statutorily defined bilingual
area may at any time exercise their right to follow the course of the proceeding in their own language
(to file applications, perform all procedural acts in their own language, irrespective of their command
of the Slovenian language), whereas the administrative body conducts the proceedings in the language
officially used in the area of the body. In accordance with the comment of the General Administrative
Procedure Act, the provision relating to incomplete applications does not apply to such applications
from members of autochthonous national communities (Article 62, paragraph 6 of the said Act).
Therefore, the costs of the translation of such applications must be borne by the administrative body.
Thus, in the territory of the municipalities populated by the Italian or Hungarian national communities,
the police are bound to use additional official languages in all areas of policing. All forms and
communication with members of the national communities have been in Italian or Hungarian. Cases of
good practice can particularly be seen in the field of preventive action, such as various warnings,
posters and leaflets, which are not only in Slovenian, but also in Italian and Hungarian, and in some
places also in the Romani language. Mention should also be made of the cooperation of
representatives of the police on various radio broadcasts (e.g. on the MMR radio, Pomurje-Hungarian
radio operating within RTV Slovenia) in which representatives of the police offer prevention advice
and present police work.
The Personal Name Act114, in Article 5, stipulates that the personal name of a member of the Italian or
Hungarian national community is to be entered in the register of births, marriages and deaths in the

114

Uradni list RS, no. 20/2006.
52

Italian or Hungarian script and form, unless otherwise decided by a member of the national
community.
The technical procedure for entering personal and geographical names in the said register (the range of
necessary characters for this purpose) is regulated by the Rules on the implementation of the Register
of Deaths, Births and Marriages Act115. Article 12 of the Rules stipulates that personal and foreign
geographical names are to be entered in the register in their original form, taking into account the set
of letters and characters available, thus ensuring a record of places and personal names in the Italian
and Hungarian languages. The set of letters and characters is defined in a separate annex to the Rules
and comprises letters of the Slovenian alphabet with particular diacritical marks, which also includes
the alphabets of the Italian and Hungarian national minorities with a view to ensuring the entry of
personal names of minority representatives.116 In addition to the letters of the Slovenian alphabet, the
prescribed set of characters also comprises letters that often appear in Slovenian proper nouns and
some other special characters117.
The Republic of Slovenia is aware of the importance of providing clear and accurate information on
administrative services and the availability of appropriate applications via the Internet. To this end, the
State Portal of the Republic of Slovenia E-government was set up in 2001 as the point of entry to
access various types of information on the state and public administration. In addition to the provision
of information on public administration, the principle aim of the portal is to make administration
services more accessible to users via the Internet and, in addition to the standard communication
channels by which citizens and business entities access public services, offer an additional electronic
channel for the provision of services.

115

Uradni list RS, nos. 40/2005 and 69/2009.
A graphic character set is defined by the ISO 8859 international standard. The encoding of ISO 8859-2,
referred to as Latin alphabet No. 2, contains graphic characters used in general administrative operations in the
Slovenian and Hungarian languages, while the encoding for the Italian language is defined by ISO 8859-1 (Latin
1) – (taking into account national minorities). Both encodings were included in the set of Slovenian standards in
1995.

Two special portals for Italian and Hungarian national communities were also established as part of
the E-government State Portal. Equivalent to the version in Slovenian, these portals contain
descriptions of the procedures in which individuals and legal persons conduct business with public
authorities. This section consists of two sub-portals (Public Administration Services for Individuals
and Public Administration Services for Businesses), which comprise most of the contents of the Egovernment State Portal. For individuals (natural persons), the descriptions are organised into sets of
17 events which are important situations in a life of an individual, from birth, education and
employment to retirement (Family and Children, Work and Employment, Health and Care,
Environment and Facilities, State and Society, Death and Mourning etc.) For legal persons, four sets
of events are presented (Sole Traders, Establishing a Company, Functioning of a Company, Societies
and Institutions). Furthermore, the first pages of the sub-portals (Citizens, Legal Entities, Public
Administration) as well as other fixed content on the E-government portal (About the Portal, For the
Visually Impaired etc.) are translated and their content appropriately adjusted; the State Portal
provides news in Slovenian and English.
The content of services and applications is provided by the competent ministries and other
administrative authorities or public authority holders, while the technological platform is maintained
by the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior and Public Administration. In addition to publication of
information on services, the portal also offers the possibility of publishing electronic forms that lie
within the responsibility of ministries and other administrative bodies. The collection of published
forms is regularly updated and gradually transposed into entirely electronic forms, where, through the
use of digital certificates, certain data are automatically entered in the user’s form. Since the body
publishing the application is generally not the same as the one receiving it (e.g. in the case of
administrative units), there is a delay in publishing applications on the E-government portal. We are
aware of this issue also in the case of publishing electronic forms in Italian and Hungarian, for which
translations are to be made.
In view of the fact that the E-government State Portal was launched in 2001, it needs to be modernised
and renovated to offer users modern online access and provide a modern point of entry in the
relationship between the user and the state. The process of modernisation will pay special attention to
improving the users’ experience, including the renovation of services and applications. Ministries and
other administrative bodies that publish services and applications on the E-government state portal
will be called upon to consistently publish applications or related forms for services, which also
applies to the versions in the Italian and Hungarian languages. This approach will require concerted
cooperation between administrative units and other administrative bodies that deal directly with
customers and ministries and other administrative authorities that prepare and publish services on the
portal.
Before the portal is renewed, an analysis will be made of the existing situation with a view to verifying
with the competent authorities which forms have not been published on the Internet but are otherwise
available in paper and electronic forms (e.g. word) from the competent authorities.
The information in electronic form is provided by the Government Portal for Children and Youth
(http://www.otroci.gov.si/), which has been open since 2007 and is available in Italian and Hungarian.
The portal is intended for the younger population and guides its users through presentations of how the
state and institutions fountion in a simple and user-friendly way.
The Government of the Republic of Slovenia received a list of questions (document MIN-LANG
(2011) of 25 May 2011) with a request to incorporate the answers in the 4th periodical report on the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The information on
individual questions according to Article 10 of the Charter are provided below.
10.1.a (i)
"Please provide concrete information on the practical use of Hungarian in local branches of the state
administration."

The Lendava Administrative Unit comprises an area of 7 municipalities with 41 settlements, of which
20 are ethnically mixed. In accordance with Article 4 of the Public Administration Act (Uradni list RS,
nos 52/02, 110/02, 56/03, 61/04, 123/04, 93/05, 113/05 – upb4, 89/07, 126/07, 48/09 AND 21/12), the
official language of the administration is Slovenian.
In its work and in operational activities with other authorities, the Lendava Administration Unit faces
the following issues regarding the language of the Hungarian national community:
- Despite initiatives and reminders from the administrative unit, individual ministries (the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Spatial
Planning) have still not published all application forms in the Hungarian language on the Egovernment state portal;
- At the local level (municipalities in the ethnically mixed area), all application forms should be
prepared and published in the Hungarian language so as to be easily and timely accessible (ecommerce).
The Murska Sobota Administrative Unit maintains that, officially, matters are well regulated.
However, the practice has certain drawbacks:
 The Murska Sobota Administrative Unit comprises 135 settlements, of which 8 (Hodoš,
Krplivnik, Domanjševci, Središče, Prosenjakovci, Pordašinci, Motravjevci and Čikečka vas)
are ethnically mixed. In the entire ethnically mixed area, only one local office (Prosenjakovci)
has a bilingual signboard.
 The local offices in Prosenjakovci and Šalovci, covering three (3) ethnically mixed areas,
employ two clerks with a high level of competence in the Hungarian language. For such jobs,
an adequate command of the minority language is an employment requirement.
 In accordance with the applicable law, the Murska Sobota Administrative Unit enables the use
of Hungarian also on the premises of this unit. The unit permanently employs an excellent
translator for Hungarian. Some other public employees also speak Hungarian. All citizens may
file a written or oral application in Hungarian, in which the procedure is conducted and a
bilingual act published. For ethnically mixed areas, the Murska Sobota Administration Unit
publishes bilingual documents (such as the decision on land consolidation). Accordingly,
bilingual application forms are available in paper or electronic form.
 The Murska Sobota Administrative Unit points out that the provisions of the Register of
Deaths, Births and Marriages Act are consistently observed. Currently, the administrative unit
is dealing with the mass replacement of personal identity documents (ID cards, passports),
whereby trilingual identity cards (Slovenian–Hungarian/English) and quadrilingual passports
(Slovenian– Hungarian/English/French) are being issued to residents of ethnically mixed
areas.
In the areas of those municipalities where the Hungarian national community resides, Hungarian is the
official language of the administration. This means that with respect to clients who are members of the
national community, the statutory right to use their language is consistently implemented in practice
and daily work, namely:
- in bilingual operations, when a party to proceedings uses the language of the national
community (bilingual forms, the conduct of administrative procedures and the issuing of
administrative acts in the Hungarian language, bilingual e-commerce, the provision of
information to the parties);
the list of job descriptions (job classification) appropriately contains certain conditions and
levels of competence in the national community language resulting directly from operational
needs;
- when filling vacancies for public positions requiring direct contact with the public, the number
of employees and qualified public employees with an adequate command of the community
language is sufficient;

55

-

public employees at the Lendava Administrative Unit are provided with a permanent option
and funding for additional education and learning of the community language (on average, 3
employees per year);
the majority of the public service employees receiving the bonus for bilingualism have a better
command of Hungarian;
the Lendava Administrative Unit employs one translator of Hungarian for translations of all
official documents (invitations, minutes, decisions, endorsements) in cases of bilingual
proceedings; the translator's presence is also compulsory in oral proceedings at locations in
bilingual municipality areas (construction matters, expropriations);
as appropriate, the translator provides assistance to public employees in bilingual operations
and in the correct use of technical terms for issuing documents in the national community
language;
the unit also employs an administrator of Hungarian;
at least one student who is a member of the national community is afforded the opportunity for
professional practice annually; in 2011, a student from Hungary participated in international
exchange practice;
in the past three years, the Lendava Administrative Unit has receive no comments from
national community members and no breach in the proceedings and provision of public
services has been recorded, nor has anyone been prevented from exercising the right to use or
communicate in the language of the national community;
the results of an annual survey on customer satisfaction prove the correctness and high level of
trust in the provision of operations in the Hungarian language which the employees of the
Lendava Administrative Unit enjoy among the public.

"What proactive measures have been taken to promote the use of Italian in local branches of the state
administration?"
The Koper Administrative Unit has recorded no difficulties, comments or complaints from members
of the Italian national community regarding the use of the Italian language. About a year ago, the
Italian Consul drew attention to this unit's websites, which were not translated into Italian. The unit
often uses the language of the Italian national community and conducts proceedings in Italian. Italian
is most often used in abbreviated administrative procedures, but rarely in special declaratory
procedures. The Koper Administrative Unit proposes that the evaluators be specific in their
statements, since only in this way can action be taken. Administrative units make efforts to comply
fully with constitutional and legal provisions, but if a deviation occurs, the Koper Administrative Unit
points out, it is appropriate to address a specific situation and eliminate any illegality.
In 2011 and the current year, the Izola Administrative Unit has detected no problems arising from its
operations or relating to bilingual operations or communication in the Italian language with members
of the Italian national community. The unit has not received any complaints indicating a violation of
rights to conduct business in the native language. On the contrary, it considers that it implements the
rights of the Italian national community with due care in terms of officials’ command of the language,
as well as the provision of bilingual forms. At the same time, it has often noted that other public sector
entities send various materials (notices, posters, forms) intended for the general public in Slovenian
only, which leads to complications, since the administrative unit is expected to post them on the
bulletin board.
The Piran Administrative Unit has reported that it operates bilingually and has encountered no major
difficulties. In the past year, this unit received one complaint from a customer because an extract from
the land register was not bilingual. Since the matter does not fall within its competence, the unit
referred the complaint to the court in Piran responsible for the land register. The unit also informed us
that notices received from individual ministries which are intended for posting on the bulletin board
were not translated. Each administrative unit prepares its own translation, which can result in different
translations of the same text.
56

"What measures have been taken to make available widely-used administrative texts and forms to the
population in Italian or bilingual versions?"
In ethnically mixed areas where the Italian national community resides, bilingualism is implemented
strictly in accordance with the Constitution and legislation and municipal regulations governing
bilingual operations in the ethnically mixed area. We consider that the use of both official languages in
this area has attained a level that makes violations of bilingualism rather exceptional, but even in such
cases, the irregularities are negligible and mainly result from a lack of knowledge of the rules
governing this issue.
The staff structure of the municipal administrative authorities of the municipalities of Koper, Izola and
Piran is in place, in terms of ensuring the constitutional and statutory obligations to use the language
of the autochthonous national community, Italian. The municipal administrative authorities have
classified positions requiring a command of the national community language, either at elementary or
a higher level. The posts have been filled accordingly. We have not encountered any difficulties in
implementing legal obligations. In addition to the attention paid to implementing bilingualism in the
operations of the municipal administrative authorities, the municipalities also focus on implementing
bilingualism in public and in public operations.
Municipal administrative authorities conduct administrative proceedings bilingually upon the request
of the party or when a request is filed in Italian. If there are two parties to the proceedings, with some
requesting the use of Italian and others not, proceedings are conducted in both the Slovenian and
Italian languages. Since it is a constitutional right of members of the Italian nationality, and officials
employed at municipal administrative authorities have no right to inquire as to which nationality the
client belongs, public service employees always grant the request whenever the client in any way
(expressly or implicitly) requires the use of the Italian language.
10.2.a, b, d, f
"Please provide more detailed information regarding the practical implementation of these provisions
with regard to Hungarian."
In the framework of the constitutional provisions on the rights of the Hungarian national community,
public employees in municipal administrative authorities comply with the instructions of the
competent national authorities. The criteria for determining the bilingualism bonus are regulated by
the municipal administration authorities on the basis of the circular letter of the Ministry of Public
Administration on 11 July 2008 no. 100-425/2008/5, while the bilingualism bonus for the director of
the municipal administration is taken into account in accordance with the previously stated Rules
determining the amount of the bilingualism bonus for directors engaged in the field of public
administration. In accordance with Article 23, paragraph 1, indent five, and Article 28 of the Public
Sector Salary System Act (Uradni list RS, nos. 108/09-UPB, 107/09-Constitutional Court Decision,
98/09-ZIUZGK, 13/10, 59/10, 85/10, 94/10-ZIU, 107/10), employees working in posts where a
command of the Hungarian language is a condition for performing their work are entitled to a
bilingualism bonus of between 3% and 6% of the basic salary; a director of a municipal administration
engaged in the field of public administration is entitled to a bilingualism bonus of 4% of basic salary
pursuant to the Rules on the amount of bonus for the bilingualism of directors engaged in the field of
public administration (Uradni list RS, no. 22/06).
The municipal authorities or their bodies in the ethnically mixed area must operate bilingually, i.e. in
the Slovenian and Hungarian languages. Bilingual operation in the municipalities is ensured through
employment contract and contracts for works. The municipal administration provides additional
control and ensures the coordination of bilingual operations. The municipalities also comply with
these principles when recruiting.
"What measures have been taken to promote the use of Italian in the municipalities concerned?"
57

We believe that the Italian language, as an official language in the work of municipal administrations,
is well established. The municipalities endeavour to find suitable solutions to all those open issues that
require further action, with a view to ensuring the consistent implementation of all rights of the
members of the Italian national community. To this end, they cooperate with the Italian SelfGoverning Community and special consideration is also given to members of the municipal council,
members of the Italian national community and the Commission for Issues of the Italian National
Community of the Municipal Council.
Some deficiencies have been established in bilingualism in the operations of public companies. The
websites of two public companies, Koper Public Utility Company and the water supply company
Rižanski vodovod Koper, of which co-founder is also the Municipality of Koper, are available only in
the Slovenian language. Notifications sent by the companies to users are bilingual, including invoices,
which is not the case with money order forms, because their set-up is originally in Slovenian.
10.2.g
"What measures have been taken, in co-operation with the Italian-speakers, to clarify complaints
regarding the adoption and use of place-names inside the “ethnically-mixed-area” where only
Slovenian place-names had been used?"
In the Republic of Slovenia, procedures for designating areas and naming and marking settlements,
streets, and buildings are laid down by the Act Designating Areas and Naming and Marking
Settlements, Streets and Buildings118 (hereinafter: the ZDOIONUS Act). Determining or changing the
names of settlements falls within the authority of local communities in cooperation with the
professional body competent for the standardisation of geographical names appointed by the
Government of the Republic of Slovenia – i.e. the Governmental Commission for the Standardisation
of Geographical Names. When determining or changing the names of settlements in areas of
municipalities where, in addition to the Slovenian language, Italian or Hungarian is used as the official
language, local communities are to designate the names of settlements in the Slovenian and Italian or
Hungarian languages. The ZDOIONUS Act provides for public participation in decision-making,
which also applies to determining/changing the names of settlements, in a way that prevents the
choice/change of the name of a settlement without prior consultation with "the persons involved" in
the area who will be affected by such changes. The persons involved should have the opportunity to
express their opinion on the ‘new’ name of the settlement in which they live.
The names of settlements are chosen by local communities and registered by the Surveying and
Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia in the Register of Spatial Units; the written record of
the name of the settlement is identical to that in the regulation (ordinance) of the local community.
The task of determining/changing the names of settlements is thus the responsibility of the local
government. The responsibility for the correct and lawful implementation of the procedures prescribed
under the ZDOIONUS Act, including prior consultation, which is open to the participation of
members and institutions of national communities, favours the local community conducting the
procedures. The Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia has not been
acquainted with any "complaints regarding the adoption and use of place names inside the “ethnically
mixed-area” where only Slovenian place names had been used".
In the ethnically mixed area of the municipalities of Koper, Izola and Piran, place names are
consistently used in both official languages, i.e. in Slovenian and Italian; consequently, no complaints
in this regard have been recorded and no measures have been necessary.

"Please submit information on measures taken to ensure that Hungarian is used in the provision of
public services."
The Lendava Administrative Unit operates bilingually; furthermore, the unit employs a translator and
an administrator for the Hungarian language. When proceedings are conducted in both languages, all
official actions (administrative acts, hearings) are professionally, and in appropriate chronological
order, held in both languages. It is the common practice for the translator and administrator for the
Hungarian language to assist other public employees, in particular in the case of less frequent technical
terms used in administrative acts.
Due to adverse financial conditions and restrictions on staff plans, employment in recent years has
come to a standstill, also in the case of retirements. As regards employment in the last three years, two
trainees were recruited for traineeships: one received a scholarship from the ministry responsible for
public administration and one was a volunteer. Every year, at least one trainee who is a member of the
national community is afforded an opportunity to undergo a professional practice programme.
Lendava Geodetic Office is responsible for the bilingual area and also operates bilingually. The
Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia ensures the implementation of public
services for members of the Hungarian national minority (bilingual signs, the provision of information
in the Hungarian language, and administrative procedures are conducted in Hungarian in accordance
with the General Administrative Procedure Act). With a view to pursuing the policy of bilingualism in
the area of Lendava, the systemisation of employment positions at the Slovenian Surveying and
Mapping Authority has envisaged posts requiring a command of the Hungarian language. The number
of employees with a command of Hungarian meets the current needs. In the case of additional needs,
the translator of the Lendava Administrative Unit is to be engaged in agreement with the said unit.
The provision of local public services (e.g. water supply, waste collection and disposal, local
passenger transport, etc.) is the responsibility of municipalities. The ministry responsible for public
administration reminds municipalities in writing of their obligations and, in accordance with the law,
provides technical assistance to them, and supervises the legality of the systemic regulations in the
field of local self-government, while the supervision of the implementation of laws and regulations
governing the provision of public services falls within the competence of the respective ministries.
Furthermore, it should be noted that representatives of minorities not only establish their own
organisation to represent them in relations with municipalities and the state, but also cooperate directly
with municipal authorities which are competent for the implementation of minority rights. On the
basis of a special voting right, they elect their own representatives to the municipal council which, as a
rule, establishes a special working body. The municipal council, as the body responsible for
establishing public institutions and enterprises providing public services, also performs a supervisory
function of the implementation of public services. The self-governing national communities give
approvals for municipal regulations relating to the implementation of the rights of both communities.
In Eko-park d.o.o. Lendava - Öko-park Kft. Lendva, a public company providing services of drinking
water supply and waste transport, of which the Municipality of Lendava is a co-founder, business is
conducted in both languages. The administration of the company communicates with clients in the
minority language if the client so requests or speaks Hungarian. All notices and publications of the
company are bilingual. Their website is available in the Slovenian language only. The meter readings
entry form is bilingual while, forms for project conditions and for obtaining approval are available
only in the Slovenian language. The invoices/money order forms are also issued in Slovenian only.
Funeral and cemetery services are provided by two independent enterprises, while the maintenance of
cemeteries is within the competence of individual local communities. The public company Center za
ravnanje z odpadki Puconci d.o.o. (Waste Management Centre Puconci) provides waste transport and
disposal services. The Municipality of Lendava is its stakeholder. The company operates only in the
Slovenian language (invoices, money order forms, websites), since it is located in the Municipality of
Puconci which is not a bilingual area.

59

"Please provide information regarding the use of Hungarian by public services
(translation/interpretation, recruitment, compliance with requests from public service employees to be
appointed in areas where Hungarian is used)."
Municipalities consistently apply the rules governing the public service system and wages in public
administration. Therefore, both languages are used equally in the provision of public services and the
operations of municipal authorities.
At the Regional Unit Murska Sobota under the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for
Agriculture and the Environment operates in Hungarian, individual inspectors receive a bilingual
bonus of 6%. In the past three years, one administrative case and two minor offence proceedings have
been conducted in the Hungarian language. On an annual basis, inspectors speak Hungarian
approximately 50% of their working time; in any case, Hungarian is used daily.
Police employees have the opportunity to learn foreign languages through language courses. The
Police Academy organises courses in English, Italian, German, Romany, Albanian, and Hungarian.
In 2012, in the area of the Murska Sobota Police Directorate, the police re-classified 25 positions with
a bilingual bonus provided for police officers who meet the requirement of a command of Hungarian
and work in areas where a fluent command of this language is imposed as a condition.
Public employees at the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia who work in
the bilingual area communicate in Hungarian daily. No major problems have been reported concerning
communication with the clients in the Hungarian language; should the need arise, the translator of the
Lendava Administrative Unit is engaged. Their The Surveying and Mapping Authority’s website is
available in the Slovenian language only.
In recent times, the authority has had no employment opportunities.
In addition, the employer does not accept any employee requests to be transferred to a bilingual area.
"What measures have been taken to ensure, in practice, that Italian is used in the provision of public
services in the area concerned and that Slovenia’s legal framework in this field is consistently
applied?"
With regard to the implementation of Article 10, paragraph 3a of the Charter, ensuring the use of
regional or minority languages in the provision of the service, the Report of the Committee of Experts
on the Charter (third monitoring cycle) established that no information had been provided on the
actual implementation of this commitment. Regarding the exercise of this right in the area where the
Italian national community resides, the third periodic report states that in ethnically mixed areas,
bilingualism must also be implemented by holders of public authority as well as by public service
providers. The report also states that bilingual municipalities already issue bilingual invoices and
money order forms for local public services. On their visit to Slovenia, representatives of Italianspeakers submitted to the Committee of Experts data indicating that in the implementation of public
services provided by administrative authorities, or other entities acting on their behalf, Italian is not
used systematically. According to the data obtained during the visit, public service providers operate
exclusively in Slovenian. Thus, there is a discrepancy between the legal framework and practical
implementation.
The provision of local public services (e.g. water supply, waste collection and disposal, local
passenger transport, etc.) is the responsibility of municipalities. The ministry responsible for public
administration reminds municipalities in writing of their obligations and, in accordance with the law,
provides technical assistance to them, and supervises the legality of the systemic regulations in the
field of local self-government, while the supervision of the implementation of laws and regulations
governing the provision of public services falls within the competence of the respective ministries. At
the same time, it should be noted that representatives of minorities not only establish their own
organisation to represent them in relations with municipalities and the state, but also cooperate directly
60

with the municipal authorities competent to implement minority rights. On the basis of a special voting
right, they elect their own representatives to the municipal council which, as a rule, establishes a
special working body (e.g. the Commission for Issues of the Italian National Community). The
municipal council, as the body responsible for establishing public institutions and enterprises
providing public services, also performs a supervisory function of the implementation of public
services. The self-governing national communities give approvals for municipal regulations relating to
the implementation of the rights of both communities. The municipalities already issue bilingual
invoices and money order forms for local public services. In the Koper Municipality, a municipal
decree imposes this obligation on all companies (not only public ones), for example, on banks. It
would therefore be appreciated if members of both minorities would notify the municipal and state
authorities of concrete cases of discrepancies between practice and the regulatory requirements.
10.4.a, b, c
"Please provide information regarding the use of Italian by public services (translation/interpretation,
recruitment, compliance with requests from public service employees to be appointed in the territory
in which Italian is used)."
All regulations adopted at the municipal level are published in the official gazettes of municipalities in
both official languages; forms/applications are also available in both official languages. All the above
are accessible to interested parties on municipal websites.
The provisions of the rules on bilingualism are respected in other public services; in particular, it
should be noted that public sector employees daily use Italian not only in administrative procedures,
but also face-to-face in oral communication or by telephone and in writing, via applications, letters, email and in all duties of the municipal administration and other public services.
Police employees can learn foreign languages through language courses. The Police Academy
organises courses in English, Italian, German, Romany, Albanian, and Hungarian. The study
programme 'Senior Police Officer' provides a 72-hour course in expert terminology in the English,
Italian and German languages. In the framework of the education programme 'Police Officer', a course
on communication in Slovenian and foreign Languages (expert terminology) provided a 37-hour
programme which was carried out in Italian in the period from 2009 to 2011 through three generations
of police officers.
In 2012, in the area of the Koper Police Directorate, the police additionally re-classified 175 posts with
a bilingual bonus provided for police officers who meet the requirement of a command of Italian and
work in areas where a fluent command of this language is a condition.
Koper Geodetic Office is responsible for the bilingual area and also operates bilingually. The
Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia ensures the implementation of public
services for members of the Italian national minority (bilingual signs, the provision of information in
the Italian language, administrative procedures conducted in Italian in accordance with the General
Administrative Procedure Act). With a view to pursuing the policy of bilingualism in the area of the
Italian national minority, the job systemisation of the Slovenian Surveying and Mapping Authority has
envisaged posts requiring a command of the Italian language; these posts are filled by employees who,
among other things, also meet the requirements for filling an employment vacancy. The competent
authority is expected to provide its website in the Italian language.
The Regional Unit Koper under the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Agriculture and the
Environment operates in Italian, where individual inspectors receive a bilingual bonus of 6%.
Fisheries inspectors lead in the use of Italian in their working time (i.e. 20%). In the past three years,
three decisions, three payment orders with supporting documentation were issued in the Italian
language. Other inspections under the Koper Regional Unit – with the exception of the wine
inspection, which has not carried out in Italian in the last three years – use Italian in their work approx.

61

1% of their working time, mainly for communication with clients by phone or in the field; in the
period concerned, no procedures were conducted.

–
ITALIAN AND HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITIES
The Government of the Republic of Slovenia received a list of questions (document MIN-LANG
(2011) 7 of 25 May 2011) with a request to incorporate the answers in the 4 th periodical report on the
implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Information on
individual questions according to Article 11 of the Charter is provided below.
11.3.
"On the last review, the representatives of Hungarian and Italian speakers complained that they did not
have any influence on the decisions of the programme council established by the Radiotelevizija
Slovenija Act. Therefore the committee of experts requested information about how the interests of
Hungarian and Italian speakers were observed by the programme council."
The operation of Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTVS) as a public institution of special cultural and
national importance in the field of broadcasting is regulated by the Radiotelevizija Slovenija Act
(ZRTVS-1). Its operation is organised so as to ensure autonomy of financing, organisation and
editorial policy. The founder of RTVS is the Republic of Slovenia, whose principal activity is to
ensure adequate funding for the performance of public service.
RTVS performs a public service in radio and television activities for the purpose of providing for the democratic,
social and cultural needs of citizens and other residents of the Republic of Slovenia. Its basic tasks include

provision for the democratic, social and cultural needs of the Italian and Hungarian communities in the
Republic of Slovenia.
The composition and operation of the Programme Committees for the Italian and Hungarian
committees is determined by ZRTVS-1 by ensuring the maximum influence of members of national
minorities on programme planning. The committees consist of 9 members, two thirds of whom are
appointed by the self-governing national communities themselves. Employees of editorial offices of
radio and television programme for the Italian or Hungarian national community appoint one member
from among their own ranks, which means that the representative of employees is usually also a
member of national communities, the remaining two members are appointed by the Programme
Council of RTVS. The current composition of the national programme councils (for the 2010-2014
period) thus reflects an almost homogenous national structure on both the Italian and the Hungarian
programme councils.
Representatives of the Italian and Hungarian national community are represented in the Programme
Council of RTVS, which is the supreme management authority. The tasks of the Programme Council
include supervising the implementation of the programming plan and programme schemes of radio
and television programmes of RTVS, which includes the radio and television programmes intended for
the national communities. RTVS provides one radio and television channel each for the autochthonous
Italian and Hungarian national communities.
The Annual Report of RTVS for 2011119 (report for 2012 is not yet available) shows that 18 hours and
15 minutes of radio programming were broadcast daily (Radio programme for Hungarian national
community – Pomurje Hungarian radio) and 4 x 30 minutes of television programming were

119

62

broadcast weekly for the Hungarian national community (Television programme for Hungarian
national community – TV studio Lendava) in 2011.
The provision of media content for the Italian national community was especially successful in 2011,
as the cooperation of RAI-Radiotelevisione Italiana and TV Slovenia increased in the framework of
the joint project Cross-border Television. In 2011, the radio programme for the Italian community,
Radio Capodistria, broadcast 394.200120 minutes of radio programming, the basis of which is news,
with an emphasis on current topics and daily reporting, music, phone-in and entertainment
programmes.
In addition, the Koper/Capodistria Regional RTV centre organised several other events which
particularly stressed the Open Doors Day on the 40th anniversary of TV Koper-Capodistria. The event
was attended by many viewers and users of the public television service from Slovenia as well as from
Italy and Croatia.
HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITY
11.1.a (i)
"What measures have been adopted to gradually increase the use of Hungarian in public television
broadcasting?"
In the programming plan for 2012 and 2013121, RTVS has undertaken to maintain the range of
programme content for the national communities while intending to increase the accessibility of its
programmes by introducing new technologies such as radio and television websites and the official
Facebook page, which adds a new, multimedia dimension to the news offer and improves interaction
with service users.
Radio and television programmes for the Hungarian national community are produced by RTV
Slovenia, at the Regional RTV Centre Maribor – Hungarian Programmes Studio Lendava. 18 hours
and 15 minutes of radio programming are broadcast daily, including Saturdays and Sundays, while the
television programmes comprise the TV series MOSTOVI-HIDAK (Bridges) broadcast by the
national television (Programme I) and by the regional TV station Maribor. 30-minute episodes of the
MOSTOVI-HIDAK series are broadcast by national television four times per week (with an additional
repeat of each episode) through most of the year, and three times per week (plus repeats) in the
summertime. The 30-minute episodes are also shown four times per week by the Regional Programme
Maribor through most of the year, and three times per week in summer. To ensure the operation of this
institution within the system of RTV Slovenia, a certain number of staff is permanently employed;
some work on permanent contracts (a special fee is collected by the national TV for this purpose). In
the studio for the Hungarian programme in Lendava, a total of 33 staff members are employed fulltime at the radio and television stations. Another 10 people work on permanent contracts for both
radio and television programmes, and 51 are on temporary contracts. 5 persons are employed through
student employment services. The radio and television programming for the Hungarian national
community in the Republic of Slovenia is therefore produced by a total of 99 people (situation as of 20
October 2011).
Programmes of the Hungarian national community are co-financed by the state pursuant to Article 30
of the Radiotelevizija Slovenija Act. The report on the eligible use of funds in 2011 on the basis of the

contract122 presents the implementation of the programme for "radio and television programmes of
RTV Slovenia in Hungarian":
In 2011, the Studio for Hungarian programmes at Pomurje Hungarian Radio and TV Studio Lendava
produced a variety of programmes intended to meet the expectations of a wide spectrum of listeners
(from children and youth to adults and the elderly) while covering practically all fields of life and
work in terms of content.
The objective of radio and television programmes in Hungarian was to raise awareness of history and
roots, promote culture, foster the mother tongue and values, strengthen national awareness, stress the
protection of national community interests and constitutional rights, and provide information,
education and entertainment. In the spirit of intercultural dialogue, both media, especially television,
also took up the noble and important role of intermediary between the Hungarian and Slovenian
nations and cultures, between the national minority, majority nation and homeland, and attempted to
contribute to tolerance and shape opinions in the multicultural and multilingual space.
The Pomurje Hungarian Radio produced about 50 programmes and programme segments of different
types in 2011. First and foremost, there is a news programme Terepjáro/Hometown News which
produces daily reports on events from the nationally mixed area and the broader region. The
programme, which is about 30 minutes long, consists of interviews, reportages, news etc. The second
pillar of news programming is news and chronicles. Eight daily news breaks were produced from
Monday to Saturday (two on Sunday), and the midday and daily chronicles were broadcast at 12.00
and 18.00, respectively.
The weekly news programme Aktuális/Aktualno is broadcast on Wednesdays; it attempts to address
the most topical events. Therefore, these programmes dealt with topical national minority issues,
topics related to bilingual education, sport, economy, agriculture and health care.
The programme Kisebbségben/Minority broadcast on Thursdays provided detailed news on national
minority policy. The programme Helyzetké/Actual Situation is broadcast on Fridays. It focuses on
current events in the economy and agriculture. Egészégügyu műsor/Health Care Programme which is
broadcast twice a week is very popular.
Two other news programmes should be noted: Sporthétfő/Sports on Monday and Térerő/Field of
Power; the latter has been running for eight years.
The counselling programme A kertész válaszol/Gardener's Answers is very popular. Counselling
programmes include Az egészséges táplálkozás művészete/The Art of Healthy Nutrition produced in
cooperation with the Institute of Public Health Murska Sobota.
The cultural and arts programmes, entertainment, youth and religious programmes that should be
noted include a weekly programme on culture entitled Horizont/Horizon and Tulipános láda/Colourful
Chest, which focuses primarily on the ethnographic heritage of Hungarians in Prekmurje.
Other programmes that deserve a mention are Értékőrzők/Value Preservers, Spiritus, Örökségünk/Our
Heritage, Mese-lesen/Fairytale Chase.
Linguistic programmes attempt to regularly feature domestic linguists and experts familiar with the
characteristics of the Hungarian dialect of Prekmurje.
The aim in the producing programmes for children and youth was to involve as many pupils from
national minority schools as possible. For religious programming, 13 masses and other religious rituals
were broadcast live in 2011.
In the first six months, a series of six programmes was prepared entitled Iskoláról iskolára/From
School to School, which gave detailed presentations of schools in the bilingual area.
The Studio of Hungarian TV Programmes of RTV Slovenia broadcast the following programmes in
2011:

Köztünk élnek/Living Among Us, and a new segment entitled Let Me Tell You Something! The visual
and graphic identity of all segments was updated.
RTV Slovenia adopted the amended criteria for determining the bilingualism bonus at RTV Slovenia
and began to pay the bilingualism bonus also to persons employed in technology and programme
production 1 September 2011.
The first step towards informing members of the Hungarian national community in their mother
tongue was taken in 1956, when a supplement in the Hungarian language entitled Népújság was added
to the local newspaper Pomurski vestnik. Since 1958, Népújság has been published as an independent
weekly. It is published by the Institute for Information Services of the Hungarian National Community
(hereinafter: ZIDMN), which was founded in 1993. The mission and task of ZIDMN and the Népújság
newspaper is to provide information to members of the Hungarian national community in their mother
tongue, to preserve and develop the language and culture of the national community and to strengthen
and develop contacts with their nation of origin and members of Hungarian national communities in
other countries, as well as with related international organisations. ZIDMN programmes are funded
from the state budget. The report on the use of funds in 2011123 by ZIDMN states that the year was
completed successfully, as they implemented the planned activities and publications and enriched their
offer with new content.
Népújság Weekly
In 2011, ZIDMN published 52 issues of Népújság, with a circulation of 1400 copies on 24 pages (16
in colour, 8 in black and white, format B4), and on 20 pages in summer (July and August). It also
published a special literary supplement Visszhang (marking 50 years of Hungarian minority
publishing), the Easter supplement (Hímeslap), the 20 August supplement (2000 év) and the
Christmas supplement (Ünnepi finomságok).
Online issue: www.nepujsag.net
On the website the Népújság Online edition of the paper is available, which publishes daily news from
the region as well as the regular weekly content from the printed edition. The online edition publishes
additional content not available in the printed edition (news about Hungarian minority communities in
the Carpathian Basin, presentation of minority media, a selection of the most interesting contributions)
and a rich online photo gallery.

Contract concluded between the Office of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities
and the Institute for Information Services of the Hungarian National Community about co-financing the
activities of the Institute for Information Services of the Hungarian National Community - Népújság weekly in
2011.
65

In addition, ZIDMN published threetwo separate publications: 35 Years of Organising Autochthonous
National Communities in Slovenia (January 2011), and the first Hungarian magazine, Kerek Perec ,
published in Slovenia, in A4 format on 80 colour pages with a circulation of 3000 copies. The
magazine brings benefits to its readers and promotes culture, values and heritage of the Hungarian
nationality in Pomurje. Its rich supplement of photographs and summaries in English make it
interesting reading both for the native population and for tourists. Together with the Hungarian
Institute for Culture, ZIDMN published the annual almanac Naptár, which subscribers to Népújság
receive free of charge.
Youth programme – Ifi monthly
In 2011, ZIDMN published 10 editions of the youth supplement Ifi. The supplement targets youth
(higher grades of elementary school and secondary school students) with whom the content is created
in close cooperation, precisely with bilingual schools in the nationally mixed area. Besides regular
sections (Visiting Class …, Student on the Scene, Ifi's Postbox, Ifi's Etiquette, Bookshelf, Cinema,
Enigmatics), Ifi focuses on a certain topic in each issue. In 2011, it presented a series of countries,
summer camps, Hungarian pop-rock, fantasy literature, the importance of speech, sport, friendship etc.
Each issue contains a poster (musicians, athletes) published at the readers' request.
Promotional activity
All ZIDMN publications (Népújság weekly, Ifi youth supplement, online edition, the new magazine
Kerek Perec, 3 separate publications and almanac), or their content, were promoted in partner
minority and other media and separate presentations. For promotional purposes and to increase its
visibility, ZIDMN acts as a media sponsor of national community cultural events and Hungarian
theatre programme in Lendava.
As a part of its own promotion, ZIDMN opened an exhibition of drawings published on the Népújság
children's site in 2010 and 2011 on 25 March 2011 in Lendava, in the foyer of the Theatre and
Concert Hall, and on 3 October 2011 at Hodoš village centre. Both exhibitions were very well
attended.
In March and April, in cooperation with the Television of the Republic of Hungary (MTV) and its
programme for Hungarians abroad, Kincskereső, ZIDMN successfully organised a public contest for
film, photographic and literary contributions focused on Pomurje.
In September, Népújság organised a traditional trip for its readers to the Hungarian towns of Keszthely
and Hévíz, which was well attended.
In October 2011, Népújság introduced two new sections: counselling – Living and Home, and
linguistics, where a linguist analyses the special features of Hungarian usage in Pomurje.
Since September 2011, ZIDMN publications have been available in Hungary, from the Litea
bookshop at Budim Castle in Budapest.
ITALIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITY
11.1.a (i)
"What measures have been adopted to form a structured human resource policy on the broadcast
media in Italian?"
Regional RTV Centre Koper-Capodistria has 137 employees working on radio and television
programmes for the Italian national community in Slovenia (52 at the radio station, 84 at the television
station, and 1 in management). A further 29 people are on permanent contracts (4 for the radio station
and 25 for the television station) and 34 on temporary contracts (17 for the radio station and 17 for the
television station), while 15 people are employed through student employment services (6 for the radio
station and 9 for the television station). Radio and television programmes for the Italian national
community in the Republic of Slovenia are therefore produced by a total of 215 people (situation as of
1 October 2011).

66

The radio station broadcasting in the Italian language was established in 1949, and the TV station in
1971. The TV station provides information for the Italian community in Slovenia and Croatia. Daily
radio and television programmes are produced by the public RTV Slovenia, at the Regional RTV
Centre Koper/Capodistria (national RTV channel). There are 18 hours of radio programming daily,
which amounts to 126 hours weekly; television programmes are broadcast for 9 hours on Tuesdays,
Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and for 7.5 hours on Mondays and Thursdays.
Programmes for the Italian national community are co-financed by the state pursuant to Article 30 of
the Radiotelevizija Slovenija Act. The report on the eligible use of funds in 2011 on the basis of the
contract124 reveals that the radio programme for the Italian national community implemented the plan,
scheme and programme guidelines.
The programme schedule of Radio Capodistria is based on news, with an emphasis on current topics
and daily reporting. Particular stress is placed on events concerning the Italian national community,
and international, national and regional politics, with live broadcasts from various locations.
Projects, events and new programmes that have been successfully implemented:
GLOCAL, two-hour news programme broadcast on Mondays that addresses tissues of local and crossborder importance;
PANDORA'S BOX, news programme that summarises the week and addresses international issues;
MINORITY, targeting the Italian minority in Slovenia and Croatia;
ECONOMY AND SURROUNDINGS; on the economy, addressing current economic issues;
FRIULIAN WINDOW, opening a window to the world of Friuli-Venezia Giulia region;
CULTURE AND SOCIETY, on minority and regional, national and international culture;
FULL STOP AND START, addressing linguistic topics in the light of current political trends;
SUNDAY LOOKOUT, Sunday programme addressing our area and the broader area of the Balkans,
with a particular emphasis on the Croatian political scene, but including the national political scene;

CHILDREN'S SONG FESTIVAL.
Particular emphasis was placed on the organisation of concerts by Rade Šerbedžija and the Livio
Morison band on the 62nd anniversary of the radio. The bilingual event broadcast by Radio Koper and
Radio Capodistria was organised in cooperation with the Tomizza Forum and the Italian community of
Koper. They also stressed the cycle of programmes about the 150th anniversary of the Italian state,
L'Italia e fatta, and the programme on the 20th anniversary of Slovenia's independence. Another
programme with particular emphasis is PANDORA'S BOX produced in Pula on the occasion of the
meeting of Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and Croatian president Ivo Josipović with the Italian
national community.
A new Radio Capodistria website was launched to add a multimedia dimension to the news offer
(http://www.radiocapodistria.net/).

Contract concluded between the Office of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities
and RTV Slovenia on co-financing radio and television programmes for the Italian and Hungarian national
communities in the framework of RTV Slovenia in 2011.
67

The TV output for the Italian national community largely implemented the programme production
plan (reduced resources for programme costs); the key programmes were news, analytical, cultural,
youth, selected entertainment, documentary and sport programmes. The emphasis was on upgrading
contents and visual quality, on information and the educational character of content, not on
commerciality with no substance. With the commitments and efforts of all editorial boards and
journalists, they continued to introduce new content and programme or television genres that, in their
estimation, contributed to refreshing, diversifying and promoting their offer. They also enhanced their
cooperation with Rai in the framework of Cross-Border Television, and with TV Slovenia. Many
programmes prepared exclusively by their channel were broadcast on the joint Cross-Border TV.
Another important result was the final transition to the production and broadcasting of all own
production in the 16:9 format.

implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Information on
individual questions according to Article 13 of the Charter is provided below.

In this respect, Paragraphs 4 to 7 of Article 11 of the Companies Act126 provides the following:
(4) Management must ensure that communications with employees within the company in connection
with the issuing of work instructions to employees, the conduct of procedures in which the rights of
employees are decided and the participation of employees in the management of the company are
conducted in Slovenian, and in areas inhabited by the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities
communications may also be conducted in Italian or Hungarian, respectively.
(5) All acts of the company must be written and published in Slovenian:
- if they are stipulated by law or by the articles of association of the company as compulsory, or
- if they are intended for members of the company or if they are important for the exercise of their
rights and duties, or
- if they are intended for people employed by the company, or
- if they are addressed to citizens of the Republic of Slovenia in connection with the company’s
affairs.
(6) In areas inhabited by the Italian and Hungarian ethnic minorities, Italian or Hungarian respectively
may also be used in the acts referred to in the preceding paragraph.
(7) The provisions laid down in the fifth and sixth paragraphs of this article shall not prejudice the
regulations on the language of official business in the Republic of Slovenia nor on the language of
operations with consumers in the Republic of Slovenia.
The Personal Identity Card Act and the Rules on the Implementation of the Identity Card Act (which
determine the issue and application of personal identity card) and the Travel Documents Act and the
Rules on the Implementation of Travel Documents Act (which determine the issue and application of
travel documents), contain no provisions that limit or exclude the use of the languages of members of
the autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national communities. The languages of both minorities in
the Republic of Slovenia are used both for documents (in the form of descriptions of data fields on
forms) and in the personalisation of personal data of document holders when a document is issued
(bilingual transcription of address and name of authority issuing the document) as per the provisions
of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia on the use of Slovenian and minority languages.
The use of bilingualism on forms is explicitly provided by the legislation noted above. Forms for
personal identity cards must be printed in Slovenian and English, and also in Italian or Hungarian in
those areas determined by statute in which people of Italian or Hungarian ethnicity respectively live
together indigenously with people of Slovenian ethnicity. A citizen with registered temporary
residence in the bilingual area who has no registered permanent residence in the Republic of Slovenia
or abroad and a citizen who has no residence is to be issued an identity card on the so-called bilingual
form if an application is lodged with an administrative unit in the bilingual area.127 Bilingual forms for
personal identity cards are determined by the rules.
Similarly, travel document forms128 must be printed in Slovenian, English and French, whereas, in
areas specified by law, where members of Italian or Hungarian national communities live together
with members of the Slovenian nation, said forms must also be printed in Italian and Hungarian.
13.1.c, d
"Please provide information about the implementation of the Consumer Protection Act with regard to
Hungarian and Italian."
The underlying provision in the field of consumer protection, the Consumer Protection Act
(hereinafter: ZVPot), states that a company must conduct business with consumers in the Slovenian
language, whereas in regions in which the autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national minorities

live, business is to be conducted in the languages of the respective minorities (Article 2). In
advertising, no distinction is made between the rights of the autochthonous and non-autochthonous
language communities, as Article 12 provides that advertising communications must be in a language
easily understandable to consumers in the area of the Republic of Slovenia. Business processes in
which companies in the areas of autochthonous settlement of the Italian or Hungarian national
community must use the language of the respective national community in accordance with Article 2
of ZVPot are specified by the Rules on the use of national community languages by companies when
doing business with consumers in areas inhabited by the Italian and Hungarian national communities
(Ur.l.RS, no. 78/08). Compliance with the legislative acts and implementing regulations in the field of
the use of language of national minorities is supervised by the Market Inspectorate of the Republic of
Slovenia. The Inspectorate thus supervises respect for, and compliance with, legislative provisions in
this field in areas with autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national minorities, and takes appropriate
measures in the event of irregularities.
"What measures have been taken to facilitate and promote the use of Italian in accordance with
Paragraph 1d of Article 13?"
The availability of social and health-care services in both minority languages is provided by Article 61
of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. According to Article 61 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Slovenia, everyone has the right to freely express affiliation with their nation or national
community; this right is not exercised and manifested before administrative authorities in prescribed
procedures, but in everyday life. Thus everyone has the right to use their own language and script in
exercise of their rights and duties and the right to request the use of a national community language in
procedures before state and other bodies performing a public function in the area of a national
community.
In view of the above, the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities
encourages the use of minority languages in the field of family and social care in individual areas. In
May 2012, the Ministry issued a circular that notifications of adjustments of maintenance should be
issued in the language of the national community (the notification of adjustment of maintenance was
translated into Italian and Hungarian); this was the result of requests from users, i.e. eligible persons or
persons liable to an adjustment of maintenance at social work centres in bilingual areas. In issuing the
notification of adjustment of maintenance, the provisions of the General Administrative Procedure Act
(hereinafter: ZUP) apply mutatis mutandis, including the provisions on the right to use the national
community language (Article 62 of ZUP). In such cases, a social work centre in an area of a
municipality where the Italian and Hungarian national minorities live is obliged to issue the
notification of an adjustment of maintenance also in Italian or Hungarian if requested by a user.
In addition, the Ministry issued leaflets on the prevention of family violence in both minority as well
as other languages.129
13.2.a
"What measures have the Slovenian authorities taken to include provisions in financial and banking
regulations that enable the use of Hungarian in completing payment orders (cheques, bills of exchange
etc.) or other financial documents?"
The legislation on payment services is linguistically neutral; therefore, it contains no provisions on the
use of a particular language when providing these services. Nevertheless, Article 79 of the Payment
Services and Systems Act (Uradni list RS, no. 58/09, with amendments), which determines the scope
of information to be communicated by the payment service provider to the user prior to concluding a
framework contract, prescribes the language in which the framework contract is to be concluded and
communication during this contractual relationship undertaken.
129

The information about these leaflets is provided in Part II of the Report.
72

"What measures have the Slovenian authorities taken to include provisions in financial and banking
regulations that enable the use of Italian in completing payment orders (cheques, bills of exchange
etc.) or other financial documents?"
See the answer above.
13.2.b
"Please provide information on the organisation of activities intended to promote the use of Hungarian
and Italian in the public sector."
In the draft Resolution on the National Programme for Language Policy 2014-2018, currently under
discussion in the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia, the Ministry of Culture as the
initiator supported the inclusion of the amendment by the Commission of the National Assembly for
the National Communities (confirmed by the Cultural Committee of the National Assembly) on
including certain additional commitments concerning the Hungarian and Italian national communities,
which was done in the form of an additional objective: the provision of conditions for the equal public
use and development of Italian or Hungarian in areas of municipalities where the Italian and
Hungarian national communities live. The following measures have been foreseen: more appropriate
systemic upgrading of bilingual operation; drafting necessary legislation to implement minority policy
on minority languages; the implementation of visible bilingualism in areas of municipalities where
Italian or Hungarian national communities live; the implementation of consumer protection also in
Italian and Hungarian in these areas; the introduction and implementation of appropriate supervision
of compliance with the provisions of legislation; a programme of language policy and financing.
The established practice at the Lendava administrative unit is to offer its employees further training
courses annually in Hungarian in cooperation with the People's University of Lendava. Employees
who work directly with users attend refresher courses in Hungarian. Apprentices and other interested
persons (university and secondary school students, journalists on press conferences) are offered
detailed presentations of the manner and specificities of operation in the use of language.
In the field of education, regular and further training, the Police Academy organises numerous
programmes, courses and other forms where police officers acquire knowledge of minority and other
ethnic languages. More information can be found in the answers to the previous questions.
13.2.c
"What measures have been taken, in consultation with Italian speakers, to ensure that social
institutions such as hospitals, homes for the elderly and social welfare institutes offer the opportunity
to accept and treat Italian speaking persons in Italian?"
Social welfare institutions such as nursing homes and others enable the admission and treatment of
speakers of minority and regional languages in their own languages. The articles of association and
other internal acts, which will be further amended for nursing homes, already contain provisions that
take into consideration minority languages (e.g. Hungarian and Italian). For regional social work
centres (in the coastal and Prekmurje regions) bilingualism is required by the Rules on organisation
and job structuring, where additional skills in minority languages are required. House rules are
bilingual.
According to the Health Services Act, health care workers who work directly with patients in bilingual
areas must have a command of national community languages. The knowledge of the language is
certified by the relevant secondary school or educational institution. According to the Act Regulating
the Pursuit of Health Professions in the Republic of Slovenia by Citizens of Other EU Member States;
the same applies to health-care workers who are citizens of other EU Member States, who must have a
command of Slovenian as well as national community languages when working in bilingual areas. The
73

provision is implemented by making linguistic ability a condition of employment in bilingual areas
among employers or the provision of health care services on a different basis. The Ministry of Health
has detected no problems in implementing the legislation.
13.2.d
"Please provide concrete information on measures taken to ensure that safety instructions are also
drawn up in Hungarian."
The Rules on the use of national community languages by companies doing business with consumers
in areas inhabited by the Italian and Hungarian national communities (adopted on the basis of
Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Consumer Protection Act) determines this obligation by companies in
the following business processes:
- the provision of basic information on products or services concerning their characteristics, intended
use, composition, instructions for use and sales conditions;
- price lists if required by a special law;
- opening times.
"What measures have been taken to ensure that safety instructions are also drawn up in Italian?"
See the answer above.
13.2.e
"Please provide information on the practical implementation of this commitment with regard to
Hungarian and Italian."
Compliance with the provisions of the Rules is supervised by the Market Inspectorate of the Republic
of Slovenia. Therefore, in areas with autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national minorities, it
checks that entities under inspection provide information on the characteristics of products, sales
conditions, information on intended use and assembly and user instructions also in Italian or
Hungarian and that these two National minority languages are taken into account in price lists (this
provision is especially relevant to catering services or the provision of various services) and to
opening times (the latter is also most commonly found in catering). If violations are detected, the
Market Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia is competent to take statutory measures to ensure
compliance with provisions on the use of the language of national minorities.

Article 14
CROSS-BORDER EXCHANGES
–
ITALIAN AND HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITIES
The Constitution guarantees the right of the autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national
communities and their members to use their national symbols freely and, in order to preserve their
national identity, the right to establish organisations and develop economic, cultural, scientific, and
research activities, as well as activities in public media and publishing. In accordance with the relevant
laws, these two national communities and their members have the right to education and schooling in
their own languages and the right to establish and develop such education and schooling. The
geographical areas where bilingual schools are compulsory are established by law. These national
communities and their members are guaranteed the right to foster relations with their nations of origin
and their respective countries. The state is obliged to provide material and moral support for the
exercise of these rights. 130 This is further specified in sector-specific laws. The Self-Governing
National Communities Act stipulates that the means for national communities to freely maintain
130

relations at different levels must be provided from the funds of self-governing local communities
(municipalities), from the budget of the Republic of Slovenia and from other sources (Article 18,
Paragraph 2: “Means for the activities of organisations and public institutions fulfilling the needs of
national communities and to finance activities arising from Article 16 shall be provided from the
means of self-governing local communities, from the budget of the Republic of Slovenia and other
sources, pursuant to the law.”) 131.
HUNGARIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITY
In its report on the implementation of the programme and the use of eligible funds for 2011 on the
basis of the contract132, the Pomurje Hungarian Self-Governing National Community states that it held
several meetings with the leading representatives of Porabje Slovenians, with whom they signed a
cooperation agreement. Talks were held with the ‘Aranycsapat Alapítvány’ (Golden Generation)
institute on the integration of members of the Hungarian national community who live in and outside
the Republic of Hungary through sport. In addition, the community successfully participated in the
project The Nation's Bread (Nemzet kenyere) which was the result of a civil initiative in Hungary.
The report on the implementation of the programme and the use of eligible funds of the Pomurje
Hungarian Self-Governing National Community of Dobrovnik Municipality for 2011 on the basis of
the contract133 shows that the community promoted and organised cultural, research, information,
publication and economic activities for the purpose of its development and strengthened contacts with
the nation of origin and Hungarian minority communities. They also applied for the call There is
Future in the Past – Enlargement of György Dobronoki House (Cross-border cooperation programme
Slovenia-Hungary 2007-2013). The intention of the community is to boost the potential for local
entrepreneurship. The investment is planned for Dobrovnik, a place with many natural and cultural
sights. The three years of ethnographic and collection work, the aim of which was to lay the material
foundations for the local ethnographic collection, involved local youth as well as staff and students of
the Ethnography Department at the University of Szeged, professionals from the Móra Ferenc
Museum in Szeged and the Kanizsai Dorottya Museum in Mohács.
The report on the implementation of the programme and the use of eligible funds of Hodoš
Municipality for 2011 on the basis of the contract134 shows that the municipality participated in
organising the Kelepelő international camp for children from Slovenia, Hungary, Vojvodina and
Slovakia. The municipality also reports that the ceremonial session held during the central event in
Hodoš municipality hosted guests from Slovenia as well as mayors and other guests from various parts
of Hungary with whom they closely cooperate, and a mayor and other representatives of Vydrany
Hodoš in Slovakia. The report on the implementation of the programme and eligible use of funds of
the Hungarian Self-Governing National Community of Hodoš Municipality includes the following:
cycling and trekking in Őrség; discovering new towns and villages; cultural sights and the preservation
of contacts with neighbouring villages on both sides of the border; an expert excursion to Hungary;
meeting at the 180 Hodoš–Szalafő border marker.

ITALIAN NATIONAL COMMUNITY
The report of the Coastal Italian Self-Governing National Community on the implementation of the
2011 programme on the basis of the contract135 states that the community implemented activities for
the protection of the special rights of the Italian national community guaranteed by the Constitution of
the Republic of Slovenia and legislation. The community promoted the development of cultural,
research, information, publication and economic activities with the aim of preserving the identity of
the community and its members, and developed contacts with the nation of origin and members of
national communities in other countries as well as with international organisations.
Excerpt from the report on the implementation of the Programme in 2011 on the basis of the
contract136 by the Italian Self-Governing National Community of Piran:
Contacts with the nation of origin are very important, as this is the way to present community's
activities in Italy and attend cultural events in their mother tongue. Under this programme, the
community also hosts cultural groups from Italy.
Many visitors attended the ninth traditional Gala Carnival Ball in Tartini theatre, which featured the
Poreč band La Giostra, local dance schools and the band Best Company with DJ Adriano Roj.
Besides concerts (e.g. by Sicilian pianist Guendalina Consoli at Tartini House), they organised theatre
performances Odissea isolana by a theatre group from Izola and I Rusteghi by a theatre group from
Trieste.
Reports on some cross-border activities were also presented at the Working Table on the Minority
Issues active within the Mixed Commission of the Republic of Slovenia and the Autonomous Region of
Friuli-Venezia Giulia, including cross-border television under Article 11 (media).
Within the framework of European Territorial Cooperation 2007-2013, Slovenia is implementing
some projects with activities that target the social inclusion of minorities, promote tolerance,
solidarity, and intercultural dialogue etc., while some of projects also comprise activities that
specifically include the use of minority language. The projects are usually supported with up to 85%
co-funding from European funds, while the smaller share (usually 10%) is co-financed from the
national budget.
A strategic project carried out under the acronym JEZIKLINGUA with the title Multilingualism as
wealth and value of the cross-border Slovenian and Italian area is being implemented by Italian
national communities under the Slovenia-Croatia Operational Programme 2007–2013. The project will
run for 40 months and is valued at EUR 3,000,000. It continues the cooperation between the Italian
minority in Slovenia and Slovenian minority in Italy established several years ago in the field of
evaluating common cultural and historical heritage. The activities in Slovenia take place in Obalnokraška, Goriška and Central Slovenia statistical regions. The objective of the project is to establish a
multimedia centre for the promotion and expansion of the Slovenian language and culture in Italy, to
prepare the institutional and structural foundations to open the first Italian bookshop in Slovenia and to
organise various linguistic activities such as free Italian-Slovenian general language courses for all the
population and specialised courses for different institutions and public organisations. The aim of the
courses is to advance the practical knowledge of Italian and Slovenian as the majority or minority
language in the area of the programme. Schools with different programmes and levels are participating
in the target didactic activities in education intended to establish networks of continuous cooperation.
135

Contract concluded between the Office of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities
and the Coastal Italian Self-Governing National Community on co-financing the activities of the Coastal Italian
Self-Governing National Community in 2011.
136
Contract concluded between the Office of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia for National Minorities
and Piran Municipality on co-financing the activities of Piran Municipality – bilingualism and other
constitutional rights – in 2011. Part of the funds received by the municipality are to be earmarked for the
administration of the municipal self-governing national community of the Italian national community.
76

Also foreseen are scientific studies as the basis for establishing an attractive communication strategy
to promote the study of both languages. Another activity that will contribute to evaluating the common
cultural heritage is the printing and reprinting books and evaluation of precious book funds.
Description of the most important activities:
 Establishment and operation of a multimedia centre and ‘Info-book’/Bookshop
A public space in the old town centre of Koper has been made available free of charge to the Italian
Self-Governing National Community (INC) of Koper, an institution authorised to implement the rights
of the Italian minority under the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. On 3 December 2010, INC
Koper in cooperation with the Italian Union officially opened Info-knjiga/Info-libro, also called Italian
Book Corner/Il Salotto del libro italiano, in this space at Župančičeva ulica 26 in Koper.
 Linguistic services
Individual institutes and institutions in the Republic of Slovenia which are in contact with users daily
(especially institutes/organisations providing public services, such as hospitals, public administration,
courts etc.) have been offered certain free linguistic services (language courses – from professional
genres and/or general) with the aim of promoting and operationalising the practical use of Italian as an
official language in some parts of Slovenia (with a particular emphasis on areas where the
autochthonous Italian minority is present) and the language of people in the neighbouring country. It is
planned to produce promotional materials to promote bilingualism and to present the active
institutions of the Italian minority; these will be widely distributed to residents of the area. By 27 June
2012, 22 out of 23 free 40-hour courses in Italian had been implemented for a total of 261 participants.
On 29 November 2012, certificates were issued for the last completed Italian course, which was
attended by 15 officers from the Piran police unit. The total number of participants was 276.
 Evaluation of cultural heritage
An anthology of famous people or famous Istrian people is being prepared; the publication will target
a wide public and is intended to serve as a supplementary textbook for secondary schools and
universities. A summary in Slovenian of the main contents will be included (historical overview,
bibliography and reviews of selected authors), which readers will receive with the Italian publication.
 Didactic activities
Facilitating the exchange of know-how in education from kindergarten to secondary/tertiary school
and promoting the development of cooperation between educational institutions or schools.
The project with the acronym LEX and title Analysis, implementation and development of protection of
national communities in Slovenia and Italy in the framework of the Slovenia-Croatia Operational
Programme 2007–2013 is implemented by Italian national communities. Didactic workshops and
meetings with final-year secondary school students at which they receive legal and historical
information are organised in the context of the project, the total value of which is EUR 604,800. The
workshops will produce bilingual publications containing a collection of laws on minority protection
at the international, European, national, regional and local levels, the results of analyses and models
prepared in the framework of the projects and communication and information activities.
