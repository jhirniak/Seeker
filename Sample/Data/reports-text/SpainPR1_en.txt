I. INTRODUCTION
1. General information
1. Historical development
Until 1978, the territorial organisation of Spain was strongly centralised as a result both of the
authoritarian political system that had governed the country from 1939 to 1975 and OF the
tradition initiated in 1700 with the establishment of the Bourbon dynasty and the imitation of
the absolutist model that prevailed in most European countries at that time.
The centralisation process was consolidated in the 19th century, on the basis of the postulates
of the French Revolution, when the idea of the Nation-State asserted itself in accordance with
the French model. The structuring of the Nation-State in Spain began with the first Spanish
Constitution in 1812 and continued throughout the 19th century with the development of the
Liberal State.
This process, however, ran parallel to a new and different process that began in 1868. In the
wake of cultural, and particularly literary, Romanticism, specific regionalist movements
appeared in various regions of Spain: Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia and, to a lesser
extent, the Community of Valencia and the Balearic Islands. The movements were at first
cultural, but began to become political from about 1890. They demanded both the social and
cultural recognition of the regional language and a new and different territorial organisation:
autonomy for the regions concerned, without, however, calling into question the unity of
Spain. In short, they wanted a change in the structure of the State, which had entered a deep
crisis with the loss of the colonies in 1898.
Political conflict, and above all the civil wars of the 19th and 20th centuries, prevented the
peaceful convergence of the two antagonistic positions: centralist Spain and the alternative
model of a decentralised Spain. In 1978, the conflict was still awaiting resolution, which was
one of the major objectives of the constituent power. At that time, Spain was organised into
50 provinces which were heavily dependent on the State both politically and administratively,
and there was no recognition of regions.
With respect to languages, the only official language was Castilian, or Spanish, regional
languages not being recognised for public use outside a limited family and social context.
Despite this, the public use of those languages was clearly on the increase from the beginning
of the 1970s onwards.
This situation was the result of a historical development which began in the early 16th century
when Castilian became the principal language of the unified Kingdom and gradually one of
the symbols of unity. It was then that it began to be referred to as "the Spanish language"; in
the 18th century, the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language 1 was founded.
The first free elections in Spain since 1936 were held on 15 June 1977. The election results
showed the strength of the nationalist and regionalist parties, especially in Catalonia and the

1

Basque Country, and the will for regionalisation of those elected from all political parties who
immediately formed Assemblies of those elected in the different regions.
The effect was to initiate the regional structuring of Spain, at the same time as the
constitutional debate was going on, so that the actions of political players anticipated and
often prejudged the decisions the constituent power adopted.
This political behaviour was accompanied by, and was the result of, significant social
pressure in favour of speedy regional recognition, especially in Catalonia and the Basque
Country, leading to the recognition of Government-regulated pre-autonomous systems,
through various legislative decrees published in 1977 and 1978 that were the first stage in
making the regional languages official.
In short, when the Constitution was finally approved in 1978, the regional map was to a large
extent already drawn and the pre-autonomous regional entities had already been given a
number of powers; in other words, the regions were already in the process of being
established and the march towards making regional languages official had begun.
This trend and aspiration to organise the country's territory on a regional basis, which
reflected the will of society as much as that of elected representatives, was crystallised in the
Spanish Constitution of 1978, Article 2 of which states that "The Constitution is based on the
indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all
Spaniards, and recognises and guarantees the right to autonomy of the nationalities and
regions which make it up and solidarity among all of them".
The 17 Statutes of Autonomy at present in force were drafted and approved on the basis of
this constitutional provision. The Statutes of Autonomy are the basic institutional law of each
Autonomous Community and were drafted by the elected representatives in each region and
then approved by Parliament through State Authorities Acts.
The Statutes successively approved were those of the Basque Country and Catalonia (1979),
Galicia, Andalusia, Asturias and Cantabria (1981), Rioja, Murcia, Community of Valencia,
Aragon, Castille-La Mancha, Canaries and Navarre (1982), and Estremadura, Balearic
Islands, Madrid and Castille-León (1983). The Statutes of Autonomy of the Cities of Ceuta
and Melilla were approved in 1995; these Cities do not have legislative capacity but enjoy
wide-ranging organisational and executive autonomy for the powers that have been attributed
to them.

2. Geographic and demographic data
The most important level of territorial organisation in Spain is the region; Spain is thus
politically and administratively divided into 17 Autonomous Communities with the territory,

6:

In order to have a clear understanding of the linguistic question in Spain, some knowledge is
needed of the main characteristics of the educational level of the population and the reading
of the written media; the following four items of information may be useful for this purpose:
1.The percentage of the population over 16 that may be considered illiterate
2. The percentage of the population over 16 that has had a university education
3. The press distribution index in each Autonomous Community
4. The percentage of the population that reads daily newspapers

4. The constitutional and administrative structure of the state
4.1. Spanish Autonomous Organisation. General principles of Spanish Autonomous
Organisation
The 1978 Constitution recognises and guarantees the organisation of the territory into
Autonomous Communities. Legal writers have termed this form of territorial organisation
"State Autonomy", to use a term mid-way between the traditional forms known as "Federal
State" and "Regional State".
In the Spanish Constitution the Autonomous State is organised on the basis of five general
principles:
1. The Autonomous State has a basis different from that of the Federal State: its
ultimate basis is the principle of national unity of sovereignty, since the latter is the
basis of the whole Spanish nation.
2. The Autonomous State opts for the "statutory model", each Community therefore
has its own particular Statute, which supplements constitutional precepts. The Statute
is at once an act of the autonomous community concerned and a State, ie national, act
which must be approved by the National Parliament.
3. The definition of the territory is voluntary; it is does not appear in the Constitution,
but in each Statute of Autonomy.
4. The existence of Statutes of Autonomy implies that the organisational models of the
Autonomous Communities are not uniform, so each Statute may outline a different
form of organisation, although in fact the Statutes have much in common with one
another.
5. Similarly, each Autonomous Community itself decides which powers it will take
responsibility for, though there are obvious similarities among the 17 Statutes in this
respect.
Nevertheless, despite the differences in the origin of each Autonomous Community, the result
is fairly consistent, so that the attributions of the various Autonomous Communities are very
similar and the exceptions very few: the economic and fiscal system of the Basque Country
11

and Navarre, the existence of Civil Law provisions particular to certain Autonomous
Communities, the existence of autonomous police forces in the Basque Country, Catalonia
and Navarre, and, logically, the existence of co-official regional languages in six Autonomous
Communities.
4.2. Powers of the Autonomous Communities
The powers attributed to the Autonomous Communities are those listed in Articles 148 and
149 of the Constitution and in the respective Statutes of Autonomy.
Because of the large number of human resources they require, the particularly wide-ranging
powers in relation to health care, education and social services, which are wholly managed by
all the Autonomous Communities, should be noted.
More particularly, for the drafting of this report, it should be recalled that, under Article
148.1.17, the Autonomous Communities have powers concerning the "promotion of culture,
research on, and, where applicable, the teaching of the language of the Autonomous
Community".
4.3. Institutional organisation of the Autonomous Communities
All 17 Autonomous Communities are organised as representative parliamentary political
systems that broadly reproduce the political organisation of the State.
Each Autonomous Community has a Legislative Assembly with a number of members
varying from 135 in the Parliament of Catalonia to 33 in the Rioja Assembly, elected for a
four-year term by universal direct suffrage through a proportional system of closed lists.
The Legislative Assemblies elect one of their members President of the Government Council,
who is the representative of the State in the Autonomous Community and accountable to the
Legislative Assembly through two supervisory mechanisms: the censure motion and the vote
of no confidence. Before being elected and appointed, the nomination is put to a vote of
appointment in the Assembly. Once invested, the President appoints members of the
Government Council who are known as Councillors.
The different Government Councils are generally organised into Consejerías or Sectoral
Departments according to criteria similar to those applied in the General Administration of
the State.
The Departments of Culture and/or Education and Culture are of particular interest for this
report: they are usually autonomous departments responsible for the linguistic policy of an
Autonomous Community in which there are other official languages in addition to
Castilian/Spanish.
The autonomous institutional organisation is completed by a High Court of Justice which is
the highest judicial body in the territory of each Autonomous Community.
Similarly, most Autonomous Communities have other bodies similar to those that exist at
State level and appear in the Constitution: Defender of the People, Court of Audit, Economic
and Social Council and Consultative Council.

4.4. Indicators of the degree of decentralisation in Spain
The result of this organisation is that Spain is structured territorially in Autonomous
Communities which have considerable autonomy. This situation is easier to understand if we
consider two indicators of administrative management:
1. The distribution of public spending between the different levels of administration:
- General Administration (Central Government)
- Administration of the Autonomous Communities
- Local Administration

:
:
:

58.7 %
28.2 %
13.1 %

2. The number of employees working for each of the different levels of territorial
organisation:
- General Administration (Central Government)
- Administration of the Autonomous Communities
- Local Administration
- Universities

4.5. Distribution of employees working for each of the different levels of territorial
organisation
With respect to their use by the public administration, the distribution of human resources
available to each level of administration is particularly helpful for understanding the impact of
administrative decentralisation on the use of regional languages; the distribution is as
follows 7 :

4.6. The special status of the Aran Valley
With respect to the internal territorial organisation of each Autonomous Community and in
direct relation to the content of this report, it should be pointed out the Aran Valley has a
special legal and administrative status, provided for in the First Additional Provision of the
Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia.
The Parliament of Catalonia then developed this organisational particularity in Act 16/1990 of
13 July on the Special Status of the Aran Valley under which the General Council, composed
of 13 members has governmental and administrative powers.

2. Regional or minority languages spoken in Spain
In view of the provisions laid down in the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages and in accordance with the level of legal protection given by the Spanish
14

Constitution and the Statutes of Autonomy, Spain’s Instrument of Ratification of the Charter
distinguishes between two types of languages, which correspond to different paragraphs in the
Instrument of Ratification.
1. Languages that are co-official with Castilian/Spanish in their respective territories, in
accordance with the provisions of the corresponding Statutes of Autonomy, namely:
- Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country: Euskera/Basque
- Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia: Catalan
- Statute of Autonomy of Galicia: Galician
- Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia: Valencian
- Organic Law Reintegrating and Improving the Fuero of Navarre: Euskera/Basque
- Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands: Catalan
2. Languages which are not co-official but appear in the respective Statutes of Autonomy as
protected languages:
- Statute of Autonomy of Asturias: Bable /Asturian
- Statute of Autonomy of Aragon: "the various linguistic varieties spoken in Aragon",
later clarified in Act 3/1999 on Aragon as meaning Aragonese and Catalan
- Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia: Aranese (from Aran)
2.1. Bable/Asturian
There are doubts as to its linguistic unity since Asturian has not been standardised or written
down8 , so the Act on Bable approved by the Legislative Assembly of the Principality of
Asturias lays down and distinguishes between:
"Section 1. - Traditional language
Bable/Asturian, as official language of Asturias will be protected. The Principality of Asturias
shall promote its use, dissemination and teaching.
Section 2. - Galician/Asturian
The system of protection, respect, safeguarding and development established by this Act for
Bable/Asturian shall be extended through special regulations to Galician/Asturian in the
areas where it is spoken as a vernacular language.
Additional Provision
Galician/Asturian shall be treated similarly to Asturian as regards, protection, respect,
teaching, use and safeguarding in the areas where it is spoken".
2.2 The "various linguistic varieties spoken in Aragon" were specified in Act 3/1999 of 10
March on the Cultural Heritage of Aragon which states that they are:
1. Aragonese. This is the linguistic variety traditionally called "Fabla" or "Aragonese
language" and spoken in some valleys in the Pyrenean area of Aragon.
8

Francisco J. Llera Ramo, Los Asturianos y la Lengua Asturiana, 1991

15

2. Catalan, spoken in the coastal areas between the Communities of Aragon and
Catalonia, in the area called “Franja de Poniente".
3. Aranese
Thirdly, there is Aranese, expressly recognised and protected by Article 3.4 of the Statute of
Autonomy of Catalonia, which states: "4. Aranese shall be the subject of special teaching,
respect and protection".
The Parliament of Catalonia then developed a special legal and administrative system for the
Aran Valley in Act 16/1990 of 13 July on the Special Status of the Aran Valley, Section 2.1
of which states: "Aranese, a variant of Occitan spoken in Aran, shall be official in the Aran
Valley".
Section 20 of the Act states: "The General Council shall have full powers over everything
concerning the promotion and teaching of Aranese and its culture, in accordance with the
general laws in force throughout Catalonia on language education and policy".
In the language policy of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia, Aranese is the subject of
a specific provision of Section 7 of Act 1/1998 of 7 January on language policy, which states:
"Section 7. Recognition and protection of Aranese.
The use of Aranese, a variant of Occitan spoken in the Aran Valley, is governed by Act
16/1990 of 13 July on the Special Status of the Aran Valley and, in addition, by the provisions
of the present Act, which may never be interpreted to the detriment of the use of Aranese".
To summarise, it is a language which, on the basis of Act 16/1990 of 13 July, enjoys the
status of co-official language, although its status does not appear in the Statute of Autonomy
of Catalonia.

3. Number of speakers and criteria used to define the term "speaking a
regional or minority language"
Although most of the languages are spoken in specific, precise areas, the socio- linguistic
situation in Spain can be described as "bilingual", since the vast majority of the population in
those territories are able to express themselves correctly in Castilian/Spanish, and in addition
have an individual knowledge of the regional language. A large percentage of the population
is therefore able to use one or other language with a greater or lesser degree of proficiency
and, in many cases, equally well.
This bilingualism makes it difficult to reply precisely to the question here. For this reason,
and because any absolute quantification of speakers will be debatable, we have preferred to
give the data provided by the various Surveys on the Use of Languages in Bilingual
Communities which were conducted by an independent Government body, the Centre for
Sociological Research, in 1993 and 1998, although they cover only the Autonomous
Communities with a co-official language.
1. Languages that are co-official in their respective Autonomous Communities:
16

- Euskera/Basque, spoken in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country
- Catalan, spoken in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia
- Galician, spoken in the Autonomous Community of Galicia
- Valencian, spoken in the Community of Valencia
- Euskera/Basque, spoken in the Community of the Fuero of Navarre
- Catalan, spoken in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands
The Survey gave those questioned five options by which to evaluate their knowledge or
command of the languages, Castilian/Spanish and the regional language, respectively:
1. Understand, speak, read and write
2. Understand, speak and read
3. Understand and speak
4. Understand only
5. Neither speak nor understand
The findings of the Survey conducted in 1998 were as follows:

In view of the actual situation of effective bilingualism, these data should be supplemented by
a second question, asked only of people who say they at el ast understand and speak their
regional language, in order to try to quantify the degree of bilingualism: "What would you say
if someone asked you if you would describe yourself as more a Spanish-speaker or a speaker
of the regional language?"
The replies to this question, again in 1998, were as follows:

- Special status of Euskera/Basque spoken in the Community of the Fuero of Navarre.
It is a language which is not spoken throughout the Autonomous Community, but only in its
Northern part. For this reason, Article 5 of the Act passed by the Parliament of Navarre
distinguishes between three areas within the Community so that each of the 265
Municipalities belongs to one of these three areas:
1. A Basque-speaking area, composed of 61 municipalities, listed in the Act, with a
total population of 54,406 inhabitants, ie 9.78% of the total population of the
Community, according to the 2001 Census.
2. A mixed area, composed of 48 municipalities with a total of 274,948 inhabitants, ie
49.6% of the population.
3. A non-Basque-speaking area, composed of the remaining 156 municipalities, with a
total of 226,475 inhabitants, ie 40.74% of the population.
- Special status of Valencian
As in the case of Navarre, Valencian is not spoken throughout the Community, but only in the
area nearest to the Mediterranean coast. For this reason, Articles 35 and 36 of the Act passed
by the Legislative Assembly of the Community of Valencia distinguish between the
predominantly Valencian-speaking areas and those that are predominantly Spanish-speaking:
1. The Valencian-speaking area, composed of 293 municipalities, listed in the Act:
109 in the province of Alicante, 83 in the province of Castellón and 101 in the
province of Valencia. According to the 2001 Census, they have populations of
1 135 274, 457 934 and 2 094 728 respectively. The total population is 3,687,936, ie
88.6%of the population.
2. The Spanish-speaking area, composed of 143 municipalities, also listed in the Act:
30 in the province of Alicante, 51 in the province of Castellón and 62 in the province
of Valencia. The total population of the area is 474,850 or 11.4% of the total
population of the Community.
2. Languages which are no t co-official but appear in the Statutes of Autonomy as protected
languages
Lack of standardisation and of an adequate written literature, especially in the case of
Bable/Asturian and Aragonese "Fabla", explains why these languages are not co-official. This
situation makes it even more difficult to quantify the number of speakers, and the population
often doubts the existence of a linguistic identity different from Castilian/Spanish.
Survey findings are sometimes difficult to interpret and are of only approximate value since
some surveys have been confined to analysing lexical similarities used by the persons
questioned.

- Languages of Aragon
1. Aragonese
According to the survey conducted in 1989 entitled “El Aragonés, Hoy” (Aragonese Today),
there were around 30,000 speakers9 living in five Pyrenean valleys of the province of Huesca:
Anso, Hecho, Bielsa, Benasque and Ainsa.

Quoted by Miquel Siguan in España Plurilingüe, 1992.

2. Catalan
In the Autonomous Community of Aragon, Catalan is spoken in various municipalities in an
area bordering on Catalonia known as "Franja de Poniente". Although it is difficult to be
specific about the exact number of Catalan-speaking municipalities, it can be said that,
generally, it is spoken in all or part of the following six regions: Ribagorza, la Litera and Bajo
Cinca, the province of Huesca; Caspe, the province of Saragossa; and Bajo Aragon and
Matarraña, in the province of Teruel. The total population of the six regions is 102,532 in 107
municipalities, but the geographic borders of the Franje are imprecise and it is calculated that
only 83 of these municipalities are Catalan-speaking.
It has been calculated that the populatio n of the 83 municipalities concerned may be 65,000.
Of these, the number of people able to speak Catalan has been estimated at some 40,000.
- Aranese
Aranese, a variety of Gascon, is a variant of Occitan spoken in the Aran Valley, a Catalan
region of the province of Lleida (Lerida) with an area of 620 km² and nine municipalities.
According to Census data for the year 2001, the total population of the region is 7,938.
According to the study conducted in 1986
as follows:
- Understand, speak, read and write
- Understand, speak and read
- Understand and speak
- Understand only
- Neither speak nor understand

4. Non-territorial languages in Spain
The Instrument of Ratification by Spain of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages makes no statement on or reference to the languages referred to in the Charter as
"non-territorial languages" since the only language with this characteristic to which the
Charter might be applied is Romani, spoken by people of Gypsy origin, though barely 100
people use the language in Spain11 , ie 0.01% of the total number of people in this group living
in Spain, while in Germany and France the percentage is 70%.

5. Recent general statements on government policy on the protection of
regional or minority languages
The Motion debated by the Chamber of Deputies on 16 December 1997 is of particular
interest since it drew together a number of specific proposals that had been submitted up to
that time.
The objectives of the Motion in general referred to different fie lds of action and it invited the
Government to adopt measures for different purposes:

a) Promoting general knowledge of the multicultural, multilingual situation of the
country.
b) Promoting an elementary knowledge of all the Spanish languages different from
Castilian throughout the territory of the country.
c) Guaranteeing effective respect for the multicultural character of Spain.
d) Providing for multilingualism in institutions.
e) Guaranteeing the exercise of the full right of citizens to communicate with the
Administration in the official language of their choice.
f) Guaranteeing the promotion and dissemination of all Spanish languages at
international level, and particularly within the European Union.
It was also agreed to establish a Sub-commission within the Constitutional Commission to
revise the legislation applicable on the subject and to propose any necessary amendments.
As for the implementation of the Motion, it should be noted that many of the proposed
measures are not strictly within the jurisdiction of the authorities; they refer to models of
social behaviour and social acceptance of the multilingual reality; it is therefore outside the
powers of the public administration to implement some of the measures provided for.
The implementatio n of these provisions therefore depends to a great extent on behaviour
outside the control of the various authorities.

II. PART ONE
1. Legal instruments and provisions for application of the Charter
We consider that the legal system currently in force in Spain as regards the recognition and
protection of regional languages and minority languages generally conforms with the level of
protection laid down in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, signed by
Spain on 5 November 1992 and ratified on 2 February 2001.
In the first place, account has been taken of the fact that the legal system applicable to
languages is based on a number of legal instruments of differing rank: the Constitution,
Statutes of Autonomy, State legislation and legislation passed by the Legislative Assemblies
of the Autonomous Communities, and other regulations and provisions issued by the various
authorities for the implementation of the Acts passed.
The legislation applicable to languages is therefore particularly substantial and complex, since
the precepts in the autonomous Acts on Language Standardisation or Use, which have a
horizontal or transversal purpose and content, co-exist with those established in the sectoral
legislation applicable to various domains where the system of co-official languages is applied:
education, the courts, administrative procedure, civil service, the media, culture, etc.
Furthermore, and in order to understand correctly the degree of protection, the very
constitutional conception at work in the Spanish Constitution of 1978 must be considered,
since it recognises the right to the formation of Autonomous Communities and institutes a
complete system of protection of the right to autonomy.
Following this recognition, the various Autonomous Communities were formed, with their
Legislative Assemblies and Government Councils, which exercise specific powers determined
by the Constitution and their respective Statutes of Autonomy.
This has an important incidence on the legal system with respect to languages, since the
power to regulate the system of regionally- spoken co-official languages other than Castilian
lies with the Autonomous Communities, which have therefore passed laws regulating their
co-official language, although the system of division of powers gives the State an important
role in the effective development of autonomous language policies.
To summarise, the Autonomous Communities have wide-ranging discretionary powers to
devise and implement language policies to promote their respective languages.

1. The Spanish Constitution
The Spanish Constitution explicitly recognises that several languages cohabit in Spanish
society, so that in the Preamble the constituent power, identified here with the Spanish
Nation, "proclaims its will to … protect all Spaniards and peoples of Spain in the exercise of
human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages, and institutions".
In the Articles of the Constitution, this linguistic plurality is reflected in a system of coofficial languages, which is provided for in Article 3:
25

"(1) Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State. All Spaniards have the duty to
learn it and the right to use it.
(2) The other languages of Spain shall also be official in the respective Autonomous
Communities, in accordance with their Statutes.
(3) The richness of the linguistic varieties of Spain is a cultural patrimony which will be the
object of special respect and protection".
More concretely, and referring to the media, Article 20.3 of the Constitution lays down:
"The law shall regulate the organisation and parliamentary control of the media owned by
the State or any public entity and shall guarantee access to them by significant social and
political groups, respecting the pluralism of society and the various languages of Spain".

2. Statutes of Autonomy of the Autonomous Communities in which the regional
language has the status of an official language
The constitutional provisions are developed and supplemented by provisions contained in the
Statutes of Autonomy, which are the basic institutional laws of each of the 17 Autonomous
Communities. Six of the Statutes refer to the legal status and protection of their languages.
2.1. Basque Country
-

Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, approved by State Authorities Act 3/1979 of
18 December:

"Section 6. 1. Euskera, the language of the Basque people, shall, like Castilian, have the
status of official language in the Basque Country, and all its inhabitants shall have the right
to learn and use both languages.
2. Considering the socio-linguistic diversity of the Basque Country, the common institutions
of the Autonomous Community shall guarantee the use of both languages by regulating their
official status, and shall harmonise and regulate the measures and means necessary to ensure
that they are learnt.
3. No one may suffer discrimination on grounds of language.
4. The Royal Academy of the Basque Language - Euskaltzaindia shall be the official
consultative institution for Euskera.
5. In view of the fact that Euskera is the heritage of other Basque territories and communities,
in addition to the links and contacts that academic and cultural institutions maintain, the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country shall be able to request the Spanish
Government to sign or, if necessary, submit to Parliament with a view to their authorisation
treaties or agreements enabling the establishment of cultural relations with States consisting
of or including such territories and communities in order to safeguard and promote Euskera".

26

2.2. Catalonia
- Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved by State Authorities Act 4/1979 of 28
December.
"Section 3. 1. The vernacular language of Catalonia is Catalan.
2. The official language of Catalonia shall be Catalan, along with Castilian, which is an
official language throughout the Spanish State.
3. The Autonomous Government shall guarantee the normal and official use of both
languages; it shall adopt the necessary measures to guarantee they are learnt and shall
create the conditions enabling them to achieve full equality with respect to the rights and
duties of the citizens of Catalonia.
4. Aranese shall be taught and shall be given special respect and protection".
2.3. Galicia
- Statute of Autonomy of Galicia approved by State Authorities Act 1/1981 of 6 April.
"Section 5. 1. The vernacular language of Galicia is Galician.
2. Galician and Castilian shall be the official languages of Galicia and everyone shall have
the right to learn and use them.
3. The authorities of Galicia shall guarantee the normal and official use of both languages
and shall strengthen the use of Galician at all levels of public and cultural life and in the
media, and shall have available the necessary resources for facilitating the learning of it.
4. No one shall suffer discrimination on grounds of language".
2.4. Community of Valencia
- Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia, approved by State Authorities Act
5/1982 of 1 July.
"Section 7. Firstly, the two official languages of the Community of Valencia shall be
Valencian and Castilian. Everyone shall have the right to learn and use them.
Secondly, the Autonomous Government of Valencia shall guarantee the normal and official
use of both languages and shall adopt the necessary measures for ensuring they are learnt.
Thirdly, No one shall suffer discrimination on grounds of language.
Fourthly, the revival of Valencian shall receive special protection and respect.

27

Fifthly, the criteria governing the use of the regional language in the administration and
education shall be established by law.
Sixthly, an Act shall define the territories in which the use of both languages shall be the
norm and those areas that may refrain from teaching and using the vernacular language of
the Community".

2.5. Navarre
- State Authorities Act 13/1982 on the Integration and Improvement of the Special Status of
Fuero of Navarre.
"Section 9. 1. Castilian shall be the official language of Navarre.
2. Basque shall also have the status of official language in the Basque-speaking areas of
Navarre.
A special Act (ley foral) shall determine the said areas and shall regulate the official use of
Basque; within the framework of general state legislation, it shall organise the teaching of
this language".

2.6. Balearic Islands
- Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands, approved by State Authorities Act 2/1983 of 25
February.
"Section 3. 1. The Catalan language, the vernacular language of the Balearic Islands, shall,
with Castilian, have the status of official language.
2. Everyone shall have the right to learn and use it and no one shall suffer discrimination on
grounds of language.
3. The institutions of the Balearic Islands shall guarantee the normal and official use of both
languages; they shall take the necessary measures to guarantee that they are learnt and shall
create the conditions enabling the two languages to achieve full equality with respect to the
rights of the citizens of the Balearic Islands".

28

3. Statutes of Autonomy of the Autonomous Communities in which the regional
language does not have the status of official language
There are two other Statutes of Autonomy that specifically refer to languages, although here
the languages mentioned do not have the status of co-official languages.
3.1. Asturias
- Statute of Autonomy of Asturias, approved by State Authorities Act 7/1981 of 30 December.
"Section 4. Bable shall be protected; its use, dissemination in the media and teaching shall be
promoted, respecting in all cases the local variants and the fact that learning them is
voluntary".
3.2. Aragon
- Statute of Autonomy of Aragon approved by State Authorities Act 8/1982 of 10 August,
later amended.
"Section 7. The different linguistic varieties of Aragon shall be protected as part of its
cultural and historical heritage".

4. Autonomous Acts passed by the Legislative Assemblies of the Autonomous
Communities
On the basis of the statutory recognition of the autonomous power to pass Acts regulating
their co-official language, the six Autonomous Communities concerned passed their
respective Acts between 1982 and 1986, the sole particularity being that the Autonomous
Community of Catalonia passed a new Act in 1998 replacing the one it had passed in 1983.
The Autonomous Community of Asturias, whose Statute does not recognise Bable/Asturian
as a co-official language, also adopted an Act in 1998, while this possibility is at present
under discussion in the Autonomous Community of Aragon.
At this stage in the report, we sha ll simply enumerate the regulations the various Autonomous
Legislative Assemblies have adopted on or relating to language and recall the substance
common to all of them.
The structure and content of these Acts are similar and, on the whole, easily comparable:
1. They always begin with a preamble that indicates their legal basis in the
Constitution and the relevant Statute of Autonomy and their purpose is stated.
2. They then confirm the status of the regional language as the "vernacular language",
its co-official status with Castilian/Spanish and legal recognition of the learning and
use of it.
3. The territorial scope of the co-official language usually coincides with the whole
territory of the Autonomous Community, the exceptions being those concerning
29

Navarre, the Community of Valencia and the Aran Valley, which have already been
mentioned.
4. Implicitly, and sometimes explicitly too, the Acts confer on the Autonomous
Administration responsibility for promoting the learning and use of the regional
language, thus compensating for its initially lower status and making effective the
right to use it at any time.
5. The purpose of all the Acts is to defend and promote the regional language, and
they can in this sense be seen as the formulation of a clear language policy.
In this connection it is useful to recall the objectives set out in Act 3/1986 of 29 April on
Language Standardisation in the Balearic Islands, Section 1 of which states:
"1. The purpose of the present Act is to enlarge upon Article 3 of the Statute of Autonomy
concerning the standardisation of the Catalan language as the regional language of the
Balearic Islands in every domain and to guarantee the use of Catalan and Castilian as
official languages of this Autonomous Community.
2. Consequently, the purposes of the Act are as follows:
(a) To make effective the increasing and normal use of the Catalan language at official and
administrative level.
(b) To guarantee increasing knowledge and use of Catalan as a language of instruction in
education.
(c) To promote the use of the Catalan language in all the media.
(d) To create social awareness of the importance for all citizens of learning and using the
Catalan language".
4.1. Basque Country
- Act 10/1982 of 24 November on Standardisation of the Use of Euskera.
- Act 15/1983 of 27 July on the Creation of the Basque Institute of Ikastolas.
- Act 29/1983 of 25 November on the Creation of the Institute of Literacy, 'Reeuskaldunisation' of Adults and Regulation of Euskaltegis (schools that teach Euskera)
(HABE).
4.2. Catalonia
- Act 7/1983 of 18 April on Language Standardisation in Catalonia (replaced by Act 1/1998
of 7 January).
- Act 16/1990 of 13 July on the Special Status of the Aran Valley.
- Act 8/1991 of 3 May on the Linguistic Authority of the Institute of Catalan Studies.
- Act 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy (replacing Act 1/1983).
30

4.3. Galicia
- Act 3/1983 of 15 June on Language Standardisation.
- Act 5/1988 of 21 June on the Use of Galician as an Official Language of Galicia by local
entities.
4.4. Community of Valencia
- Act 4/1983 of 23 November on the Use and Teaching of Valencian.
- Act 7/1998 of 16 September creating the Valencian Academy of Language.
4.5. Navarre
- Act 18/1986 of 15 December, on the Basque language.
The measures provided for in the Act differ for each of the three areas into which Navarre is
divided under Section 5: a Basque-speaking area (Sections 10 to 16 of the Act), where
Basque/Euskera has a very high level of protection very similar to that established by other,
bilingual, Autonomous Communities; a mixed area (Section 17), where all citizens may
address the Administration in either language; the Act therefore compels the administrative
authorities of Navarre to have the necessary linguistically competent staff; and a non-Basquespeaking area (Section 18), where only the right to address the administrative authorities in
Basque is recognised, so the authorities may ask those concerned for translations in
Spanish/Castilian, or use their own translation services.
4.6. Balearic Islands
- Act 3/1986 of 29 April on Language Standardisation.
4.7. Asturias
- Act 1/1998 of 13 March on the Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian.
4.8. Aragon
This Autonomous Community does not yet have specific legislation on language, though
there are a number of express references in legislation on culture.
- Act 3/1999 of 10 March on Aragonese Cultural Heritage.
Section 4, entitled "Minority Languages" states that "Aragonese and Catalan, minority
languages in Aragon, where different linguistic variants are found, are part of the cultural
heritage and shall be specially protected by the Government".
The Second Final Provision of the same Act, "Languages of Aragon", states that "An Act on
the languages of Aragon shall lay down the specific legal framework for regulating the coofficial status of Aragonese and Catalan, minority languages of Aragon, as well as the
effective rights of the respective linguistic communities, both in the field of education of and
31

in the vernacular language and in that of the full standardisation of the use of these two
languages in their respective territories".

2. Legal protection of the right to use the regional language
The legal protection provided for in the Constitution, the Statutes of Autonomy and
Autonomous Acts is strengthened in certain cases by specific precepts which recognise the
right to effective protection of the right through the courts.
- Legislation passed by the Community of Valencia
- Act 4/1983 of 23 November on the Use and Teaching of Valencian.
"Section 6. Citizens shall have the right to obtain from judges and courts protection of the
right to use their languages, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation in force".
- Legislation passed by the C.F. of Navarre
- Act 18/1986 of 15 December on the Basque Language.
"Section 4. Citizens shall be able to apply to the judges and the courts, in accordance with the
legislation in force, for protection of the linguistic rights established in this special Act (ley
fuero)".
- Legislation passed by the A.C. of the Balearic Islands
- Act 3/1986 of 29 April on Language Standardisation.
"Section 5. 1. Citizens shall be able to apply to the judges and the courts to obtain judicial
protection of the right to use one of the two official languages, in accordance with the
legislation in force.
2. The Government of the Autonomous Community has the power to act of its own motion or
at the request of an individual or a group of persons; it shall take the political, administrative
and judicial action necessary to render real and effective the rights of citizens recognised in
Section 3 of the Statute of Autonomy and by the present Act".

32

3. Case-law of the Constitutional Court on co-official languages
The detailed nature of the autonomous regulations governing languages and the various
interpretations made by the State and the Autonomous Communities of the scope of the coofficiality of Spanish/Castilian and the regional language have resulted in a considerable
number of cases being brought before the Constitutional Court, particularly in the early
1980s, compelling the Court to clarify the scope of the co-officiality established in Article 3
of the Constitution.
The case- law of the Constitutional Court in this connection is of fundamental importance for
understanding the exact substance of the legislation in force, so that a full study of the legal
situation obtaining in Spain with respect to linguistic co-officiality requires that the following
judgments, handed down in the disputes over the laws indicated below, be taken into account:
1. Judgment 6/1982 of 22 February, handed down with respect to two conflict of
jurisdiction claims lodged by the Basque Country and Catalonia with respect to Royal
Decree 480/1981 of 6 March on the functioning of the State Inspectorate for Nonuniversity Education.
2. Judgment 76/1983 of 5 August, handed down with respect to four prior claims of
unconstitutionality against the State Authorities Act Harmonising the Autonomous
Process passed by the State.
3. Judgment 87/1983 of 27 October, handed down with respect to two conflict of
jurisdiction claims lodged by the Basque Country concerning Royal Decree 1765/1982
on Minimum Teaching Hours for Middle Schools in General Elementary Education.
4. Judgment 88/1983 of 27 October, handed down in relation to a conflict of
jurisdiction claim lodged by the Basque Country concerning Royal Decree 3087/1982
of 12 November on the Core Curriculum for the upper level of General Elementary
Education.
5. Judgment 30/1986 of 20 February, handed down in relation to two claims of
unconstitutionality for violation of fundamental rights 854 and 873/1983
6. Judgment 82/1986 of 26 June, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the State against the Basque Country Basic Act on the
Standardisation of the Use of Euskera.
7. Judgment 83/1986 of 26 June, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the State against the Language Standardisation Act of
Catalonia.
8. Judgment 84/1986 of 26 June, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the State against the Language Standardisation Act of
Galicia.

33

9. Judgment 74/1987 of 25 May, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the Basque Country against State Act 14/1983 on
Assistance for Detainees and Prisoners.
10. Judgment 190/1987 of 1 December, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality on the grounds of violation of fundamental rights 573/1986.
11. Judgment 69/1988 of 19 April, handed down with respect to a conflict of
jurisdiction claim lodged by the State concerning Decree 189/1983 of 15 September
issued by Catalonia on the Labelling of Goods Marketed in Catalonia.
12. Judgment 80/1988 of 28 April, handed down with respect to a conflict of
jurisdiction claim lodged by the State concerning Decree 101/1985 issued by Galicia
on the Use of the Galician Language in the Labelling and Advertising of Goods
Marketed in Galicia.
13. Judgment 123/1988 of 23 June, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the State against the Language Standardisation Act of
the Balearic Islands.
14. Judgment 105/2000 of 13 April, handed down with respect to a claim of
unconstitutionality lodged by the Deputies against State Authorities Act 16/1994 of 1
July on the Judicial Power.
The substance of this case law may be briefly summarised by the following decisions of the
Constitutional Court:
1. The Constitution and the Statutes constitute the legal framework of linguistic
pluralism (STC 82/86. FJ 1).
2. According to the Constitution, a language is official "independently of its situation
and weight as a social phenomenon" (STC 82/86. FJ 2).
3.Under Article 3.2 of the Constitution, co-officiality obtains "for all the public
authorities situated within the Community" and not only for autonomous authorities
(STC 82/86. FJ 2).
4. It is only compulsory to know Castilian. The use of another language is a right, not
an individual duty (STC 82/86. FJ 3).
5. Minimum hours and teaching of vernacular languages (STC 87/83. FJ 5; et STC
88/83. FJ 4).
6. The use of a language other than Castilian may not be imposed, even exceptionally
(STC 82/86. FJ 10).
7. Under Article 3.2 of the Cons titution, the Autonomous Community has the power to
regulate co-officiality and its scope (STC 82/86. FJ 4).
34

8. The State does not have the power to regulate the "elementary aspects" of coofficiality; it does, however, have the power to regulate the "essential guarantees
relating to equality in the use of Castilian and to fulfilment of the duty of learning
Castilian" (STC 82/86. FJ 4).
9. The protection of languages as "cultural heritage" within the meaning of Article 3.3
of the Constitution is the responsibility of the State and the Autonomous Communities
(STC 82/86. FJ 4).
10. Linguistic co-officiality does not bestow any specific powers on bilingual
Autonomous Communities vis-à-vis the State (STC 69/88. FJ 3; STC 80/88. FJ 3; and
STC 190/87. FJ 2).
11. The regulation of linguistic co-officiality does not imply the attribution of specific
powers outside the framework established by the Constitution and the Statutes of
Autonomy (STC 123/88. FJ 5).
12. In administrative procedure, a single language may be used "if the rights of a party
justifiably able to claim not to know the vernacular language are not infringed" (STC
82/86. FJ. 9).
13. The authorities must use the language jointly agreed by the parties (STC 82/86. FJ
9).
14. During administrative procedure, the vernacular language may not be used
exclusively if one of the parties asks for Castilian (STC 82/86. FJ 9).
15. The ability to "initiate administrative or judicial actions" in order to defend the
linguistic rights of third parties is not a "necessary speciality" deriving from the
substantive law of the Community within the meaning of Article 149.1.6. of the
Constitution (STC 83/86. FJ 2).
16. The use of bilingual official leaflets is not unconstitutional, and this is also valid
for the State authorities situated in the Autonomous Community (STC 82/86. FJ. 13).
17. The right to "be served" in the chosen language is subject to the "possibilities of
the moment" and "the adoption of the necessary means" by the administrative
authorities (STC 82/86. FJ 8).
18. Outside the corresponding Autonomous Community, no right exists to use the
regional language (STC 30/86. FJ. 4).
19. The scope of co-officiality in the Administration of Justice is particular (STC
82/86. FJ 6 and 11; STC 84/86. FJ 3).
20. Knowledge of the regional language may be an advantage for occupying a post, so
long as there is no discrimination (STC 82/86. FJ 14).

35

21. The "duty" to know the regional language is incumbent on the "Autonomous
Administration" and not on its civil servants (STC 76/83. FJ 42).
22. It is the State that has the power to issue the "sworn translator" diploma (STC
82/896. FJ. 12).
23. A Spanish citizen who does not understand or speak Castilian has the same right as
a foreigner to be assisted by an interpreter (STC 74/87. FJ 2 and 3).
24. The right to an interpreter should be understood within the meaning of Articles
24.1 and 14 of the Constitution concerning equality (STC 74/87. FJ 3).
25. The right to use the language is derived directly from the Constitution and "does
not require" legislative enactment to be enforceable (STC 74/87. FJ 4).
26. In the event of "dubious interpretation", the official Castilian version prevails over
the text in the vernacular language (STC 83/86. FJ 3).
If the most important judgments are examined more closely, it can be seen that the
Constitutional Court has essentially interpreted two questions concerning linguistic coofficiality.
1. The Concept and Status of Co-official Language
- According to the concept established by Constitutional case- law (Judgments 82/1986
and 46/1991), a language is official when it is recognised by the authorities as a means
of communication within and between them, and between them and private persons,
with the corresponding full validity and legal effects.
- Castilian is the normal means of communication of the authorities and citizens
among themselves throughout Spain. Spanish is the only language which all
Spaniards have a duty to know, and it is the only language that all Spaniards may be
presumed to know.
- Similarly, in the territories where there are co-official languages, private individuals
are fully legally entitled to use one of the official languages in their relations with the
authorities, and the right to use those languages with any body or organisation is a
constitutional right (Article 3.2) and a right deriving from the respective Statute of
Autonomy.
- In any case, Castilian as official language of the State cannot be opposed to other
languages since the respect and protection of the various languages of the peoples of
Spain is the responsibility both of the State and the authorities of each Autonomous
Community.
2. Use of the Official Language: concerning the possibility of using the vernacular with the
authorities.

36

- A distinction has to made, as the Constitutional Court has done in Judgment 82/1996,
between the official recognition of a language, ie the assignment to it of full legal
effects, and the possibility of using it during court or administrative proceedings.
- Use of Castilian is the general rule in court proceedings, and the vernacular language
may only be used within the territory of the corresponding Autonomous Community.
- The right to use the vernacular language of the Community in and with the
administration and authorities implies that the two official languages have equal status
within the corresponding Autonomous Community.
- The case- law of the Constitutional Court supports this view, particularly in Judgment
105/2000 of 13 April which, with respect to the use of official languages by judicial
organs, states that the judicial organs do not have a duty to know the official language
since justice is one and the same throughout Spanish territory; judges may therefore
have papers or documents written in a language they do not understand translated
when translation is necessary for them to be able to perform their judicial functions.
- For this reason, although knowledge of the official language in an Autonomous
Community is an advantage that is appreciated in candidates for the judiciary, it is not
an indispensable condition, since justice is considered to be one and the same
throughout the national territory and candidates may change post and Autonomous
Community.

4. Bodies promoting the protection and development of languages
1. Academic bodies
Because of the status of "vernacular language" of the various regional languages of the
corresponding Autonomous Communities, the Statutes of Autonomy and the legislation on
language standardisation usually impose certain specific duties on the respective Autonomous
Communities concerning the protection and safeguarding of the regional language, including
in the linguistic-academic field.
For example, Decree 173/1982 of 17 November regulating the Galician langua ge adopted by
the Government Council of the Autonomous Community of Galicia, was an early text
containing some regulations and setting out certain specific precepts in this respect. For
example, it authorises the Institute for the Galician Language to "draw up the Elementary
Orthographic Vocabulary of the Galician language, which will be an inventory of the
essential words of the language and a spelling guide".
For this reason, for academic purposes, all the Autonomous Communities with co-official
languages have formally recognised an academic linguistic authority whose function is to see
that the language is preserved; the authorities thus recognised undertake this task with the
organic and functional autonomy this type of activity requires.
There follow the regulatory references concerning recognition of the role of these institutions,
and their names and postal addresses.

2. Administrative units for language policy
Since one of the purposes of autonomous legislation is the defence and promotion of the
vernacular language, each of the Autonomous Administrations with a vernacular language has
its own administrative unit responsible for language policy, independently of the functions
that may be the responsibility of specialised administrative units such as educational and
cultural institutions.
As an example, the law regulating the administrative unit of the A.C. of Catalonia states that
its function is to "see that the Catalan language is used correctly and guarantee application
of the rules of the Institute of Catalan Studies and the use of the terminology developed by the
TERMCAT Terminology Centre in all the Departments of the Autonomous Government of
Catalonia, since one of its functions is to assist the Departments of the Autonomous
Government of Catalonia with terminology".

5. Consultation of the bodies indicated
The drafting of this report on the application by Spain of the European Charter for Regional
or Minority Languages has required reliable sources of information of various kinds, such as
socio-economic, demographic and sociolinguistic data, but essentially legal information, since
the commitments made by member states by signing and ratifying the Charter are decisive in
the legal sphere.
This is particularly important in the case of Spain as most of the languages spoken in the
country, and those to which the Charter refers, have the status of official languages in their
respective Autonomous Communities. The regulatory framework for the protection of these
languages is therefore public and widely known in all public authorities and society as a
whole.
Furthermore, the Autonomous Communities have wide powers to protect and promote their
regional languages and therefore have the appropriate legal resources for laying down the
mechanisms for promotion in their respective languages.
In drafting the report we have therefore taken into account, firstly, the legislation passed by
the Autonomous Communities to protect and promote the use of their respective languages,
most of it in the form of Acts on language standardisation and regulations for their
44

implementation which are part of the legal order, are widely known and have been the subject
of Cons titutional Court rulings interpreting the scope of co-officiality of the two languages
provided for in the Constitution, Statutes of Autonomy and autonomous legislation.
Secondly, the way in which the Charter is drafted has compelled us to consider the various
sectors it covers: education, judicial authorities, administrative authorities and public services,
the media, culture, economic and social life, and transfrontier exchanges.
For this reason, in order to describe the legal situation in force, the subject of this report, we
need to review the system of distribution of powers between State and Autonomous
Communities, since for each of the above domains we have had to take into account how the
Constitution distributes powers:
1. Education. The State may pass basic legislation for developing the right to
education (Article 149.1.30 of the Constitution) and the Autonomous Communities
may then develop that legislation.
2. Judicial Authorities. The State has exclusive responsibility for the administration of
justice (Art. 149.1.5), as well as commercial, criminal and procedural legislation (Art.
149.1.6), although the Autonomous Communities which have their own civil law
(civil "fueros") have power to conserve, amend and develop it (Art 149.1.8).
3. Administrative Authorities and Public Services. The State may pass basic
legislation to establish the bases of the legal system of public administrations and the
regulations governing civil servants; it also has the power to regulate the common
administrative procedure, legislation on forcible expropriation, basic legislation on
contracts and administrative concessions (Art. 149.1.18).
4. Media. The State passes basic legislation on the press, radio, and television and, in
general, of the other media (Art. 149.1.27).
5. Cultural Activities. This power is not specifically attributed to either the State or the
Autonomous Communities and may be exercised by both (Art. 149.2), but is of
particular importance to Autonomous Communities with vernacular languages.
6. Economic and Social Life. This area of activity is not the exclusive power of either
level of government, with the result that, having eliminated any legal obstacles to coofficiality of two languages, the application of the provisions of the Charter on this
point is more a matter for the people involved and social initiative than the authorities.
Account need only taken of the fact that the State has power over the bases and
coordination of general planning and economic activity (Art. 149.1.13). As for the
Autonomous Communities, they have a particularly important role to play in
defending and protecting consumers.
7. Transfrontier Exchanges. This area, too, is not the subject of a material power but of
anticipated relations between the administrative levels of the two States.
Generally speaking, therefore, there is basic state legislation for a number of these areas
(education, justice, public services, the regulations governing the civil service, and the
media), while Autonomous regulation and policy are for the most part supplementary to it.
45

The main interest with respect to Autonomous activity is therefore to know what actions
concern language policy and, subsidiarily, create a legal framework different from that of the
State.
We have therefore reviewed the positive law applicable in each of the six Autonomous
Communities with a co-official language, the especially important multi-sectoral reports and
more particularly the Report on Language Policy, 2001, drafted by the Autonomous
Government of Catalonia, and the General Plan to Promote the Use of Euskera, approved by
the Basque Government in 1998.
For the drafting of certain points, we have also been in contact with, in particular, the
Autonomous Communities of Asturias and Aragon, as the fact that the languages spoken in
their respective territories do not have the status of co-official languages means that far less
information is available about them than about policies on co-official languages.

6. Measures taken to raise awareness of the Charter
The wide dissemination of the Statutes of Autonomy, most of which have been in force for
more than twenty years, the public's detailed knowledge of them and the consolidation of
autonomous organisation itself all mean that there is no need to take special measures to make
the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages more widely known.
On this point, it should be remembered that the general framework for the protection of
regional and minority languages established by the Spanish Constitution in 1978 and the
Statutes of Autonomy on the whole coincides with the level of protection the European
Charter for Regional and Minority languages requires for such languages. Application of the
Charter does not therefore require Spain to pass new legislation or take measures that were
not already provided for before the Charter was ratified.
Furthermore, the status of "co-official languages" conferred on them by the Constitution and
the Statutes enables their speakers to avail themselves of a great many legal instruments to
make effective their right to use the languages in everyday life. The protection provided by
the courts for this purpose has generally proved effective.

7. Measures taken to implement the recommendations of the Committee of
Ministers and bring them to the notice of the authorities concerned
As we have seen, the level of legal protection already existing was considered sufficient. It
was therefore not considered necessary to conduct a specific policy of informing the
authorities that have to apply the Charter, in view of the fact that its application coincides
with the application of laws already in force in Spain.
The debate that took place in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate when the Charter was
ratified was revealing in this respect12 since all the speakers clearly agreed that the Spanish
system coincided with the Charter.

12

Chamber of Deputies, Journal of Debates No. 86, 19 October 2000, pp. 2333 to 2336.

46

There is therefore in Spain a general perception that considerable progress has been made in
recent years with respect to the protection of regional languages, although protection can of
course always be improved. The debate provided a good illustration of this opinion. Some
amendments were of course submitted, particularly in relation to the protection of
non-co-official languages, but the debate showed there was consensus on the issue and that
Spain was one of the first countries to ratify the Charter; one Spanish Deputy was even
involved in the drafting process at the Council of Europe; so the amendments initially
suggested were then withdrawn in order to arrive at a transnational amendment acceptable to
all groups.

III. PART TWO: APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 7 OF THE CHARTER
ON OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES
1. Measures taken to apply Article 7 of the European Charter for Regional
or Minority Languages
1. As we saw when describing the regulatory framework in force on the protection of regional
and minority languages in Spain, they are recognised in Article 3.2 of the Spanish
Constitution of 1978, which expressly provides that "the other languages of Spain will also be
official in the respective Autonomous Communities, in accordance with their Statutes". We
then find an additional reference similar to the one contained in Article 7.1 (a) of the Charter:
"3. The richness of the linguistic varieties of Spain is a cultural patrimony which will be the
object of special respect and protection".
Then, at a lower regulatory level, the Statutes of Autonomy have chosen the type and level of
protection of the respective languages they considered appropriate, although four of the
Statutes refer to the regional language as the "vernacular language" of the Autonomous
Community; such a reference is absent only from the Statutes of the Communities of Valencia
and Navarre, since in these Communities the regional languages are not spoken throughout
their territory.
2. The geographic boundaries of the Autonomous Communities are not directly established by
the Constitution, but by the Statute of each Autonomous Community. This implies that, since
1978, regional identity has been produced through a voluntary process conducted by the
Deputies and Senators elected at the general elections held in 1977 and 1979.
Central Government has not intervened in the process of territorial organisation and cannot
change the present borders of the Autonomous Communities without their agreement, as this
would require a procedure similar to that used for the approval of the Statutes of Autonomy.
In this sense, we believe the objective set in Article 7.1(b) concerning the effect of
administrative organisatio n on the promotion of the regional language to have been
satisfactorily met, since the promotional measures introduced in any case depend upon the
will of the democratically elected institutional bodies of each Autonomous Community.

47

3. This is why the Central Government places no obstacle in the way of each Autonomous
Community’s conducting such policy to promote and defend its language as it considers
appropriate and applying that policy to the degree it considers appropriate in particular
domains, so long as it does not violate the principles of equality before the law and no
discrimination on grounds of language.
Part Three of this report gives a more detailed account of the policies conducted by each
Autonomous Community and their scope.
4. The maintenance and development of relations between Autonomous Communities using
the same language is another possibility expressly provided for in Article 145 of the
Constitution, although it lays a duty on Autonomous Communities that sign collaboration
agreements for this purpose to communicate their intention to Parliament so that it may
pronounce upon the document submitted.
In the final analysis, the Government may not oppose such cooperation agreements, which are
in reality solely conditional upon the will of the democratic institutions of the Communities
concerned.
The following are a few examples of agreements made by Autonomous Communities:
- Collaboration Agreement between the A.C. of the Basque Country, the C.F. of
Navarre and the General Councils of the Fueros of Alava, Guipúzcoa and Biscay on
the Funding of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language - Euskalzaindia, signed
on 7 October 1989.
- Collaboration Agreement between the A.C. of the Basque Country and the C.F. of
Navarre on the Reception in Navarre of the services of Euskal- Irrati Telebista (EITB),
signed on 17 April 1996.
- Collaboration Agreement between the A.C. of the Basque Country, the C.F. of
Navarre, the Councils of the Fueros of Alava and Guipúzcoa and the Association
Unibertsitate Zerbitzuetarako Euskal Ikastextea on carrying out Linguistic Research
Projects for the Standardisation of Euskera, signed on 7 March 1997.
- Collaboration Agreement between the A.C. of the Basque Country, the C.F. of
Navarre, the Councils of the Fueros of Alava, Guipúzcoa and Biscay and the Royal
Academy of the Basque Language - Euskaltzaindia to establish the General Bases of
Collaboration among the parties and to regulate the commitments of each party to
guarantee the future activity of Euskaltzaindia, signed on 8 March 2000.
- Collaboration Agreement between the A.C. of Catalonia and the A.C. of the Balearic
Islands on the Establishment of the Ramón Llull Consortium on the External
Promotion of Catalan Language and Culture, signed in February 2000.
5. The measures to facilitate and promote the learning of regional languages by non-speakers
are also very relevant to an analysis of the measures taken to apply the provisions of Article 8
of the Charter. It should be pointed out in this respect that these objectives have been largely
met after almost twenty years of application of the various Acts on Language Standardisation,

48

most of which have in this respect been fully developed and carefully applied by the
Autonomous Communities.

2. Levels of responsibility
1. As has already been indicated, in Spain the power and political and administrative
responsibility for promoting regional languages lies with the Autonomous Communities. For
this purpose the Autonomous Communities have set up specific administrative units with
transversal powers with respect to language policy. These units are listed above.
2. In the various Autonomous Communities there are also bodies and institutions that
specialise in the various sectors mentioned in the Charter. The following, with their titles and
legal personalities, may be cited as examples:
- A.C. of the Basque Country
- Basque Institute for Adult Literacy and 'Re-euskaldunisation' (HABE) (autonomous
body)
- Basque Institute of Public Administration (autonomous body)
- Basque Radio Television/ Euskal Irrati Telebista (public body)
- Radio Vitoria / Gazteiz Irratia S.A. (public limited company)
- Basque Television / Euskal Telebista S.A. (public limited company)
- Basque Radio Broadcasting / Eusko Irratia S.A. (public limited company)
- Euskal Media S.A. (public limited company)
- Euskalnet S.A. (public limited company)
- A.C. of Catalonia
- Public Administration School of Catalonia (autonomous body)
- Catalan Radio and Television Corporation (public body)
- Cataluña Radio S.A. (public limited company)
- Televisión de Cataluña, S.A. (public limited company)
- Catalan Institute of Arts (autonomous body)
- Library of Catalonia (autonomous body)
- Autonomous Entity of the Official Journal and Publications of the Generalitat
(autonomous body)
- Teatro Nacional de Cataluña S.A. (public limited company)
- A.C. of Galicia
- Galician School of Public Administration (autonomous body)
- Radio-Television Company of Galicia (public body)
- Televisión de Galicia S.A. (public limited company)
- Radiodifusión de Galicia S.A. (public limited company)
- Galician Institute of Dramatic Arts and Music (autonomous body)
- Council of Galician Culture
- Community of Valencia
- Valencian Radio- Television (public body)

49

- Televisión Autonómica Valenciana S.A. (public limited company)
- Radio Autonomía Valenciana S.A. (public limited company)
- Theatre of the Generalidad of Valencia (public body)
- Valencian Institute of Modern Art (public body)
- C.F. of Navarre
- Public Administration Institute of Navarre (autonomous body)
3. For the development of this policy, the Autonomous Communities have sought the
cooperation of other bodies, particularly those of local corporations. In the case of the A.C. of
Catalonia, this has been institutionalised in the form of the Consortium for Language
Standardisation, whose objective is to "promote the learning, use and dissemination of the
Catalan language"; for this purpose, it will "take initiatives in the field of the unregulated
teaching of Catalan and provide cultural, translation and correction services and any other
services arising from the purposes of the Consortium".
The consortium formula has also been used by the same Community to establish the
Terminology Centre Consortium (TERMCAT), set up by the Autonomous Community, the
Institute of Catalan Studies and the Consortium for Language Standardisation, the purpose of
which is to "plan and coordinate terminological research, and organise the review and
standardisation of Catalan terms, which will be conducted in accordance with the linguistic
regulation of the Institute of Catalan Studies".
4. The A.C. of the Balearic Islands has a similar organisation, the Consortium for the
Promotion of the Use of the Catalan Language and the External Dissemination of the Culture
of the Balearic Islands, established by Decree 126/1997 of 3 October as an "association with
its own legal personality, composed of the Government of the Balearic Islands and the
University of the Balearic Islands. The Island Council of Majorca, the Island Council of
Minorca and the Island Council of Ibiza and Fomentera may also be parties to it ".

50

IV. PART THREE: APPLICATION OF THE PARAGRAPHS AND OPTIONS
CHOSEN BY SPAIN
Because of the legal nature of the commitments Parties make when they sign and ratify the
European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, we believe that the substance of this
section of the report should essentially be of a legal nature.
This view is strengthened by the fact that in Spain the most important languages the Charter
refers to have the status of "co-official languages" in their respective territories, so that the
method essentially used in the drafting of this report has been to review the laws and other
provisions in the systems of Autonomous Communities me ntioned above.
For an accurate reading and interpretation of this section, it should be remembered that a great
many languages are spoken in Spain and were mentioned in the declaration made when the
Charter was ratified, since the large number of languages, socio- linguistic situations and
positive law provisions necessarily make for a complex and certainly uneven report.
As already stated, we have reviewed the laws in force adopted by the State, the six
Autonomous Communities with a co-official language and the two other Communities whose
Statutes recognise linguistic specificities. The result is inevitably heterogeneous since each
Autonomous Community has implemented a particular language policy and the result is not
always comparable between Communities.
It is not easy to divide the subject into the seven material domains mentioned in the Charter,
since the measures included in Articles 11 and 12 are not always easily separated, and are also
closely related to the substance of Article 13. Similarly, some measures taken to apply the
substance of Article 13 require particularly complicated description.
The other question to be borne in mind in order to understand the complexity of the report is
the chronological development, given that co-officiality has already been applied for twenty
years and that over an already considerable period there have been some changes.
In the final analysis, some of the information given will be essentially illustrative: the public
subsidies and aid allocated are good example s of this. In short, we have looked for elements
common to the six cases, but the results are not always applicable to all the cases or for every
measure.
To sum up, we consider that the legal arrangements in Spain to a great extent reflect the
substance of the measures described, so we have not exhaustively enumerated all the laws in
force, the frequently reproduced references adequately describing the high degree of
officiality and protection of minority languages in Spain.

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
1. General Regulation of the Education System
- State legislation/measures
The Acts regulating the Spanish education system and the other basic regulations
implementing them include the necessary elements for the learning and dissemination of
regional languages and cultures.
The "objectives" of the different levels and stages serve to promote the various languages and
cultures of Spain, with both their general and common aspects (Castilian as the common
52

language of all Spaniards, the common culture) and their specific aspects (the co-official
languages, the specific cultural characteristics of the various regions and nationalities of
Spain) being learned and respected by all pupils.
The Acts on education give the Autonomous Communities responsibility for curricula, so that
they include the study not only of their official languages but also of the history and culture
particular to them.
The Autonomous Communities have also regulated their full use and teaching in universities,
without prejudice to Article 27.10 of the Constitution which provides, "The autonomy of
universities is recognised under the terms established by law".
Section 2 of State Authorities Act 6/2001 of 21 December on the Universities provides for the
autonomy of universities through approval of their individual Statutes of Organisation and
Functioning. The universities in the Autonomous Communities with a vernacular language
may therefore provide teaching in that language, although it is for each university to decide
the scope of this right.
The following are the most important statutory and regulatory references:
- State Authorities Act 8/1985 of 5 July Regulating the Right to Education.
"Section 2.1 Guided by the principles and declarations of the Constitution, education in the
educational establishments referred to in this Act shall have the following objectives … .
(e) Training to respect the linguistic and cultural diversity of Spain."
- State Authorities Act 1/1990 of 3 October on General Regulation of the Education System.
As established by State Authorities Act 8/1985, this Act provides that one of the goals of the
Spanish education system is "(e) Training to respect the linguistic and cultural diversity of
Spain."
The essential goal of this Act, however, was to organise the education system on the basis of
different levels: pre-school education, primary education, secondary education (which
includes compulsory secondary education, the baccalaureate and intermediate vocational
training), advanced vocational training and university education.
The objectives, content, teaching methods and evaluation methods of each level are together
referred to as the "curriculum" and the Act lays down how the curriculum is to be set:
"Section 4.2 The Government shall determine the core curriculum, expressed in terms of
capabilities, content and evaluation criteria, the purpose of which shall be to ensure an
education common to all pupils and the validity of the corresponding diplomas. The essential
content of the core curriculum shall never require more than 55% of teaching hours in the
Autonomous Communities with an official language other than Castilian, and 65% in the
others."

53

On this basis, "The competent education administrations shall draw up the curricula of the
various levels, stages, cycles, degrees and types of the education system, part of which shall
be the core curriculum."
If one looks at each of the levels, the Act sets out for each of them the following capabilities:
1. Primary Education (6 to 12). It will help to develop in children the ability to:
"(a) Use appropriately the Castilian language and the official language particular to the
Autonomous Community" (Section 13).
2. Secondary Education. This comprises Compulsory Secondary Education (12 to 16) and the
Baccalaureate (which is comprised of two academic years, from the age of 16). The abilities
required are:
- For Compulsory Secondary Education:
"(a) Understanding and correct expression, in the Castilian language and in the official
language particular to the Autonomous Community, of complex oral and written texts and

- For the Baccalaureate
"(a) Command of the Castilian language and the official language particular to the

For each of these three educational levels the Act details the different areas of knowledge and
specifies for each level the area corresponding to "Castilian language, official language
particular to the corresponding Autonomous Community, and literature" (Sections 14, 20 and
27).
- Furthermore, before the approval of the respective Statutes of Autonomy, the State had
already taken up and regulated the use of the regional languages in education through a
different channel.

- Laws and other measures passed by the A.C. of the Basque Country
- Act 10/1982 of 24 November Regulating the Use of Euskera:
"Section 15. All pupils shall have the right to be taught in both Euskera and Castilian at the
different educational levels.
For this purpose, the Parliament and the Government shall take the appropriate measures to
ensure the gradual universalisation of bilingualism in the education system of the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country."
- Act 1/1993 of 2 February on Basque Public Schools
In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, this Act
guarantees pupils' right to receive an education in both Euskera/Basque and Castilian, and
requires that both languages be included in educational curricula in order that there should be
55

genuine ability to understand, speak and write both languages so that they may be used as
languages of communication and for ordinary use.
The Act lays down the following linguistic models for the education system:
- Model A, in which the curriculum is essentially taught in Castilian and some activities or
subjects may be taught in Euskera/Basque.
- Model B, in which the curriculum is taught in Euskera/Basque and in Castilian.
- Model D, in which the curriculum is taught entirely in Euskera/Basque.
In all three models, Castilian Language and Literature and Basque Language and Literature,
as well as modern languages, will be taught essentially in the respective languages.
According to the Political Agreement on the Education Pact, pre-school education and
compulsory education will be regulated on the basis of all three models, A, B and D. Only
models and A and D will be provided in post-compulsory education.
In the academic year 1999-2000, the linguistic models established in the schools of the
Community of the Basque Country were as follows, expressed as percentages of all pupils 13 :

- Laws and other measures passed by the A.C. of Catalonia
- Act 1/1998 of 7 January on Language Policy and its Implementing Decree of 4 February
1998 (Measures for Applying the Act).
In accordance with the provisions of this Act, Catalan is the language of instruction at all
levels and in all types of education, both university and non-university, and is the language
normally used in the teaching and administrative activities of educational establishments.
Catalan is the langua ge of communication and instruction in non-university education;
children may receive primary education in their usual language, whether Catalan or Castilian.
"Catalan Language and Literature" are an integral part of the school curriculum.
Pupils have to know and be able to use both languages normally and correctly by the end of
compulsory education and the certificate of secondary education may not be issued to pupils
who are unable to demonstrate their written and oral ability in them.
Teaching staff are required to be proficient in both official languages of the Community and
be able to use them in their teaching. The necessary training programmes have been
established to this end.
"Section 20. 1. As the vernacular language of Catalonia, Catalan shall also be the language
of instruction at every level and in every kind of education.
2. Educational establishments of every level shall make Catalan the means of normal
expression in their teaching and administrative activities, both internal and external."
"Section 21. 1. Catalan shall normally be used as the language of communication and
instruction in non-university education.
58

2. Children shall have the right to receive primary education in their usual language, whether
Catalan or Castilian. The Administration shall guarantee this right and provide the means
necessary for making it effective. Parents and guardians may exercise this right on behalf of
their children by requesting its application.
3. Adequate teaching of Catalan and Castilian shall be guaranteed in curricula so that
children, whatever their usual language at the beginning of education, are able to use both
official languages normally and correctly by the end of compulsory education.
4. In post-compulsory education, the educational administration shall promote programming
and teaching policies that guarantee further development of the knowledge and use of the two
languages so that young people acquire the instrumental and cultural skills particular to
these subjects.
5. Pupils shall not be separated in different schools or classes on the basis of their usual
language.
6. The secondary education certificate shall not be issued to pupils who are unable to
demonstrate a command of oral and written Catalan and Castilian appropriate for this level.
7. Pupils who have been exempted from learning Catalan during all or part of their education
or who have received compulsory education outside the territory of Catalonia, in
circumstances that the Autonomous Government of the Generalidad shall lay down in
regulations, shall not be required to demonstrate knowledge of Catalan.
8. Pupils who enter the education system of Catalonia late shall receive special, additional
support for learning Catalan."
"Section 22. 1. In higher education establishments and universities, both teaching staff and
students shall have the right to express themselves, orally and in writing, in the official
language of their choice.
2. In their respective fields of competence, the Government of the Generalidad, the
universities and higher education establishments shall take appropriate measures to ensure
and promote the use of the Catalan language in all educational, non-educational and
research activities, including the reading of doctoral theses and in competitive examinations.
3. The universities shall provide courses and other appropriate means to enable students and
teaching staff to improve their understanding of the Catalan language.
4. Universities may, if necessary, lay down specific criteria for language use in activities
connected with international commitments."
The other important measure with respect to education is:
- Decree of 30 August 1983 applying language standardisation in the field of non-university
education.
59

- Laws passed by the A.C. of Galicia
- Act 3/1983 of 15 June on Language Standardisation.
Title III of this Act lays down the principles on the use of Galician in education. The Act
makes Galician an official language at all levels of education, university and non-university,
and pupils have the right to receive primary education in their mother language. Pupils may
not be separated in different schools on linguistic grounds, and separation in different classes
is also to be avoided. By the end of compulsory education, pupils have to be able to speak and
write Galician and Castilian to equal levels.
Study of the Galician language is compulsory at all non-university levels of education in both
public and private schools.
The Act contains a special feature in that it also provides for the granting of exemptions to
certain pupils in exceptional circumstances.
Exemptions are regulated by Decree 253/1990 of 18 April; they may be granted to pupils
whose immediately preceding education was in another Autonomous Community or abroad.
There are also exemp tions for pupils who have moved out of the territory of the Community
and pupils with physical, principally hearing, difficulties. The exemptions must be authorised
for each academic year and may not be granted for more than three consecutive years. The
Decree was later developed by the Order of 18 June 1990.
"Section 12. 1. As the vernacular language of Galicia, Galician shall also be the official
language of instruction at all levels of education.
2. The Autonomous Government of Galicia shall lay down rules for the use of the official
languages in education, in accordance with the provisions of this Act."
"Section 13. 1. Children shall have the right to receive primary education in their mother
language.
The Galician Government shall take the necessary measures to make this right effective.
2. The education authorities of the Autonomous Community shall take measures to promote
the gradual use of Galician in education.
3. Pupils may not be separated in different schools on the grounds of their language.
Separation into different classes shall also be avoided, unless exceptional educational
requirements make it advisable."
"Section 14. 1. The Galician language shall be a compulsory subject at all levels of nonuniversity education.
The effective use of this right shall be guaranteed in all public and private schools.
2. The Galician Government shall determine by regulation the exceptional circumstances in
which a pupil may be exempted from compulsory study of the Galician language. No pupil
may be exempted from this obligation if he or she has been educated without interruption in
Galicia.
60

The education authorities of the Autonomous Community shall ensure that by the end of the
stages in which Galician is compulsory pupils shall have an oral and written command of that
language equal to that of Castilian."
"Section 15. 1. Teachers and students of university level shall have the right to use, orally and
in writing, the official language of their choice.
2. The Galician Government and the university authorities shall take appropriate measures to
make the use of Galician normal in university education.
3. The education authorities shall take appropriate measures to ensure that language is not
an obstacle to making effective pupils' right to acquire knowledge."
- Decree 247/1995 of 14 September, amended by Decree 66/1997 of 21 March, implementing
Act 3/1983 on the Use of and Teaching in the Galician Language in General Education
provided at the various non-university levels.
It lays down the conditions fo r the use of the Galician language in general education provided
for in the LOGSE. Under the terms of the Decree, the education administration and
educational establishments in Galicia will use Galician in their internal and external relations,
as well as in their administrative documents.
General education governed by the LOGSE allocates the same number of teaching hours to
Galician and Castilian. During pre-school and early primary education, the language used will
be the one that predominates among the pupils. In the second and third stages of primary
education, at least two subjects will be taught in Galician, one of which must be Knowledge
of the Natural, Social and Cultural Environment.
In compulsory secondary education, Social Sciences (Geography and History) and Natural
Sciences will be taught in Galician. Of the optional subjects, Environmental and Health
Sciences and the optional subjects offered by schools will be taught in Galician.
In the first year of the Baccalaureate, the core subject Philosophy and one specific subject in
each special section, detailed in the Decree, will be taught in Galician. In the second year,
History will be taught in Galician, as will specific subjects in each special section, laid down
in the Decree. The optional subjects listed in the Decree will also be taught in Galician.
In special vocational training, theoretical- practical subjects will be taught in Galician so as to
facilitate pupils' social and occupational integration.
The teaching of areas and subjects not mentioned above will be taught in the language laid
down in each school's Education Plan, respecting the balance between the two official
languages of the Community.
The selection system for admission to the teaching profession includes a test of knowledge of
the Galician language. The Order of 25 November 1997 (DOG 22.12.97) regulates the
conditions and knowledge required of teachers in private schools in the Community and the
61

certification procedure for teaching in pre-school, primary, compulsory secondary and
baccalaureate education.
Other measures have also been passed in the specific field of education of which the
following are the most notable:
- Decree of 17 November 1982 on regulation of the Galician language. Appended to it is the
Agreement made between the Royal Galician Academy and the Institute of the Galician
Language of 3 July 1982.
- Decree 135/1983 of 8 September on Application of Act 3/1983 of 15 June on Language
Standardisation.
- Decree 253/1990 of 18 April.
- Order of 18 June 1990.
- Decree of 8 April 1994 on exemption from Galician in elementary and intermediate
education.
- Laws and other measures adopted by the Community of Valencia
- Act 4/1983 of 23 November on the Use and Teaching of Valencian.
Under the terms of the Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia, the Valencian
Parliament passed Act 4/1983 on the Use and Teaching of Valencian, Title II of which
concerns the application of Valencian in education and exceptions to the rule.
As we saw in the first part of the report, the Act defines two linguistic areas in the
Community for each of which a list of municipalities is given, the first containing
predominantly Valencian-speaking, the second predominantly Castilian-speaking,
municipalities. In schools in the latter group, Valencian was to be gradually introduced into
education according to the socio- linguistic situation.
The Act lays down that both languages are compulsory in curricula, without prejudice to any
exemptions that may be granted to pupils living temporarily in the Community or living in
predominantly Castilian-speaking municipalities.
"Section 18. 1. The inclusion of Valencian in education at every level shall be compulsory. In
the Castilian-speaking territories listed in Chapter V, it shall be introduced gradually,
according to their particular socio-linguistic situations, in a manner to be determined by
specific regulations."
- Decree 79/1984 of 30 July for the application of the Act in non-university education,
subsequently amended.
The Decree states that educational establishments must teach Valencian and Castilian,
although in predominantly Castilian-speaking areas Valencian will be introduced gradually.
62

Primary education will be in the mother tongue. In the predominantly Valencian-speaking
municipalities, the education administration must gradually introduce the relevant teaching,
using Valencian as the language of instruction. School education plans should determine the
subjects to be taught in Valencian and Castilian in the middle school years in order to arrive at
a balanced command of the two languages at the senior stage and intermediate levels.
- Order of 23 November 1990 regulating the application of Valencian as a language of
instruction in schools with a majority of pupils whose family language is Castilian.
Application of the "linguistic immersion" programme requires the prior approval of the
school's governing bodies. Education plans should specify the subjects to be taught in each
language and the number of teaching hours.
- Decrees 233/1997 and 234/1997 of 2 September on the approval of Basic Regulations for
Pre-school and Primary Schools, and Secondary Schools, respectively.
They require that school education plans should include and develop bilingual education
programmes.
The programmes may be in one of the following three forms: the Valencian Teaching
Programme, Linguistic Immersion Programme or Gradual Inclusion Programme.
Because Valencian and Castilian are co-official in the Community, teaching staff must be
proficient in both languages. The application of this requirement was made subject to job
description lists and the corresponding periods of transition.
In the year 1999-2000, Linguistic Immersion Programmes were run in 204 pre-school centres
and primary schools and Valencian Teaching Programmes in 440. A total of 96,171 pupils
were involved in the two programmes, with a significant rise of 15,046 over the previous
year.
Similarly, 193 secondary schools ran Valencian Teaching Programmes involving 25,247
pupils, an increase of 2,389 over the previous year15 .
- Laws and other measures adopted by the F.C. of Navarre
- "Fuero" Act 18/1986 of 1 December on Basque.
In accordance with the provisions of State Authorities Act 13/1986 of 10 August on the
Integration and Improvement of the Special Status of the Fuero of Navarre, the Community
passed this Act regulating the use of different languages at all levels of the education system,
both university and non-university. For linguistic purposes, it divides the Community of the
Fuero into three areas: a Basque-speaking area, a mixed area and a non-Basque-speaking area.
In the first (Basque-speaking) area, pupils are taught in the official language of their choice or
the choice of their legal representatives. Pupils have to demo nstrate an adequate level in both
languages by the end of basic education and may be exempted from Basque if they have been
to school in another area or territory.
15

Education, Culture and Sport.

63

In the mixed area, Basque is included in teaching gradually through the creation in schools of
streams in which instruction is in Basque for those who request it.
In the non-Basque-speaking area, the teaching of Basque is promoted and, if necessary,
financed in full or in part by the authorities, in accordance with demand.
"Section 19. All citizens shall have the right to be taught in Basque and Castilian at all levels
of education (…)."
"Section 20. The Government of Navarre shall regulate the incorporation of Basque in
education plans and determine modes of application in each school, in the framework of this
"Fuero" Act for the different areas."
- Fuero Decree 159/1988 of 19 May regulating the incorporation and use of Euskera in nonuniversity education.
This Decree sets out the following linguistic models for the Community's public and private
schools:
- Model A: Teaching in Castilian with Euskera/Basque as a subject.
- Model B: Teaching of most subjects in Basque and the rest in Castilian.
- Model D: Teaching in Basque with Castilian as a subject.
- Model G: Teaching in Castilian.
According to the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport, in the year 1999-2000, the
linguistic model followed by all pupils at the different levels of education (public and private
schools taken together) was as follows:

The data on Models B and D are given together since Model B is little applied in the Foral
Community of Navarre.

64

- "Foral" Decree 160/1988 of 19 May 1988 on retraining in Euskera of non-university
teaching staff of public and private schools.
This Decree requires teachers applying for posts in the teaching of or in Basque to know
Euskera/ Basque, command of the language being compulsory for such posts. It also lays
down that knowledge of Basque will be regarded as an advantage for other teaching posts.
- Laws and other measures adopted by the A.C. of the Balearic Islands
- Act 3/1986 of 19 April on La nguage Standardisation.
Act 3/1986 of 19 April was passed as a development of the Statute of the Balearic Islands
which empowered the authorities of the Autonomous Community to promote the learning and
use of the vernacular language of the Balearic Islands.
It regulates various aspects of the teaching of the language in the Islands' education system
and makes Catalan, with special attention to the variant of the Balearic Islands, an official
language at all levels and in all types of university and non-university education. It also lays
down that at least as many teaching hours should be allocated to it as to Castilian Language
and Literature.
By the end of compulsory education pupils should be able to use Catalan and Castilian
normally and correctly, tho ugh pupils who have received part of their schooling outside the
territory of the Balearics may be exempted. The education department must provide the
means to avoid pupils being separated in different schools because of language.
Existing and new teaching staff must be proficient in oral and written Catalan and Castilian.
Courses will be provided so that complete proficiency may be achieved.
"Section 17. Catalan, as the vernacular language of the Balearic Islands, shall be co-official
at every educational level."
"Section 18. 1. Pupils shall have the right to receive their primary education in their own
language, whether Catalan or Castilian.
2. For this purpose the Government shall introduce appropriate measures to make this right
effective. Parents or guardians shall in all cases be able to exercise this right on behalf of
their children by applying to the competent authorities for it to be satisfactorily applied."
"Section 19. 1. Catalan language and literature shall be compulsory at all levels and in all
types of university and non-university education, particular attention being paid to the
contribution of the Balearic Islands. Application of this provision shall be guaranteed in all
teaching establishments.
2. In education curricula, teaching hours shall be allocated to Catalan language and
literature in accordance with State study plans and shall be at least equal to those allocated
to Castilian language and literature.

65

3. Private schools receiving public subsidies and providing regulated education based on a
language which is not official in the Autonomous Community shall teach the Catalan and
Castilian languages as compulsory subjects, without prejudice to State regulations on this
matter, in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.2 of the State Authorities Act on the
Right to Education."
"Section 20. 1. The Government shall adopt the provisions necessary to ensure that pupils in
the Balearic Islands, whatever their usual language at the beginning of education, are able to
employ Catalan and Castilian normally and correctly by the end of compulsory education.
2. The school certificate may not be issued to pupils who, having begun General Elementary
Education after the entry into force of this Act, are unable to demonstrate adequate oral and
written proficiency in both official languages by the end of that education. However, pupils
who have obtained the relevant exemption during an academic year or who have received
part of their schooling outside the territories of the Catalan linguistic community, in
circumstances that the Government shall lay down in regulations, may not be required to
demonstrate knowledge of Catalan."
"Section 21. Study plans shall be adapted to the objectives set out in this chapter."
"Section 22. 1. In order to make effective the right to teaching in the Catalan language, the
Government of the Autonomous Community shall take the necessary measures to ensure the
oral use of this language as the usual means of communication in teaching in all educational
establishments.
2. The administration shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the Catalan language is
gradually used in all educational establishments in order to guarantee its use as a normal
means of expression, both in internal and external actions as well as in administrative actions
and documents.
3. The administration shall provide the means necessary to ensure that pupils will not be
separated in different establishments because of language."
"Section 25. 1. Teaching staff and students in higher education institutions shall have the
right to use, orally and in writing, the official language of their choice.
2. The Government of the Autonomous Community and the university authorities shall
undertake to ensure, through classes or other means, the comprehension and use, both oral
and written, of the Catalan language by teaching staff and students in higher education."
"Section 26. The Government of the Autonomous Community shall promote the development
of the teaching materials needed to make the teaching of both languages possible and shall
make the requisite budget appropriations."
- Decree 92/1997 of 4 July 1997 regulating the use and teaching of and in the Catalan
language, the vernacular of the Balearic Islands, in non-university education establishments.

66

This decree stipulates that Catalan will be the language of communication in the education
system and that it should gradually be introduced in schools through their Language Plans.
Within four years, pupils must be taught the language in the form la id down in the decree.
It does not lay down specific subjects that have to be taught in the two languages in preschool education, this being determined by the Language Plans of the schools themselves,
with the same number of hours. Pupils will arrive in primary school able to communicate
adequately in both languages.
In primary education, the subject Natural, Social and Cultural Environment will be taught in
Catalan. The other subjects, up to half of teaching hours, will be determined by the Language
Plan, which must be approved by a qualified majority of the school's Governing Board, which
will also specify the subjects to be taught in Catalan, the vernacular language of the Balearic
Islands, and those to be taught in Castilian.
In compulsory secondary education, social sciences, geography and history, and the natural
sciences will be taught in Catalan, the vernacular of the Balearic Islands. The other subjects,
up to half of teaching hours, will be determined by the Language Plan, which must be
approved by a qualified majority of the school's Governing Board and also specify the
subjects and the groups and levels in them to be taught in Catalan.
With respect to post-compulsory education, provisions approved once the LOGSE has been
generally established will specify the subjects to be taught in Catalan, particularly where the
pupils arriving at this stage have been taught those subjects in Catalan during compulsory
secondary education.
For the time being, the use of Catalan will be at least equal to the use of Castilian.
The education department and non- university educational establishments will gradually use
the vernacular of the Community in their relations with each other and with territorial
administrations and other public and private bodies in the Balearic Islands. They will also
promote the use of Catalan in the cultural action organised by establishments and the
supplementary activities offered to pupils. Administrative documents concerning the internal
running of educational establishments, such as minutes, memoranda and announcements are
to be drafted in Catalan.
- Order of 12 May 1998 developing Decree 92/1997 of 4 July.
- Laws and other measures adopted by the Principality of the Asturias
- Act 1/1998 of 23 March on the Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian.
In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of the
Asturias, Bable will be protected and its use, dissemination in the media and teaching shall be
promoted, respecting, in all cases, local variants and the fact that learning it shall be
voluntary.
The Act was passed to develop the Statute and provides for the presence and promotion of
Bable in the education system.
67

The Act guarantees the teaching of Bable at all levels and stages of the education system,
respecting the fact that learning it is voluntary. It will be taught in normal teaching hours and
considered part of the curriculum.
Choosing to study Bable/Asturian may in no case be a cause for discrimination against pupils

conditions of equality.
In the year to which this report refers, the Act’s implementing regulations had not yet been
approved and various matters are therefore awaiting regulation, above all the teaching
diplomas needed to authorise the textbooks that will have to be used, the organisation of
subjects and regulations approving the syllabus at different levels and stages of education.

4. Teaching of Regional Languages outside their Territorial Context

Paragraph 2.
With regard to education and in respect of territories other than those in which the regional
or minority languages are traditionally used, the parties undertake, if the number of users of
a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide teaching in or of
the regional or minority language at all the appropriate stages of education.
With respect to the teaching of regional languages outside their territorial context, the basic
regulations provide for the study of all languages in all the Autonomous Communities, both
through their presence as optional subjects in schools and in the non-compulsory teaching of
official language schools, where demand justifies it.
Official language schools are public institutions supervised by the Ministry of Education and
Culture or the Departments of Education of the Autonomous Communities which provide
public, non- university language teaching. Catalan, Galician and Euskera/Basque are offered,
as well as many foreign languages. There are official language schools in every Autonomous
Community.
Some Autonomous Communities also recruit for teaching posts in foreign universities.

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
1. General Legislation
- State legislation/measures
- State Authorities Act 6/1985 of 1 July on the Judiciary. What is of interest to us here is
Section 231 on the knowledge and use of the official languages of the Autonomous
Communities in judicial proceedings. It states:
“1. In all judicial proceedings, Judges, Magistrates, Public Prosecutors, Clerks and other
servants of the Courts shall use Castilian, the official language of the State.
2. Judges, Magistrates, Public Prosecutors, Clerks and other servants of the Courts may also
use the official language of the Autonomous Community if none of the parties objects that he
or she does not know that language and is therefore likely to be left without defence.
3. Parties, their representatives and those directing them, as well as witnesses and experts,
may, in both oral and written statements, use the language which is also official in the
Autonomous Community in whose territory the judicial proceedings are taking place.
4. Judicial provisions and documents submitted in the official language of an Autonomous
Community shall, without needing to be translated into Castilian, be fully valid and effective.
They shall be translated if they are to produce effects outside the jurisdiction of the judicial
bodies situated in the Autonomous Community, unless those effects will be produced in an
Autonomous Community with the same official language. They shall also be translated where
the law requires it or at the request of a party claiming to be without defence.
74

5. During oral proceedings, the Judge or the Court may at any time authorise any person who
knows the language used to act as interpreter, after that person has sworn an oath or made a
promise."
This Act has been supplemented by the case-law of the Constitutional Court handed down in
Judgment 105/1992.
- Act 2/1992 of 30 April on Criminal Procedure.
Although this Act does not specifically set out regulations on the use of the official languages
of the Autonomous Communities during a trial, since the above- mentioned Act on the
Judiciary had already done so, Section 440 lays down with respect to witnesses:
“if a witness does not understand or speak the Spanish language, an interpreter shall be
appointed who shall take an oath in court to be guided appropriately and faithfully in his or
her task. This shall make it possible to question the witness and receive his or her replies
through the interpreter. Statements shall be taken in the language used by the witness and
translated into Spanish."
- Act 1/2000 of 7 January on Civil Procedure.
With respect to the use of the official languages of the Autonomous Community, Section 142
of this Act expressly provides:
"1. In all judicial proceedings, Judges, Magistrates, Public Prosecutors, Clerks and other
servants of the Courts shall use Castilian, the official language of the State.
2. Judges, Magistrates, Public Prosecutors, Clerks and other servants of the Courts may also
employ the other official language of the Autonomous Community if none of the parties
objects that he or she does not know that language and is likely to be left without defence.
3. The parties, their solicitors and barristers, as well as witnesses and experts, may, in both
oral and written statements, use the other official language of the Autonomous Community in
which the proceedings are taking place.
4. Judicial provisions and documents submitted in the official language of an Autonomous
Community shall, without needing to be translated into Castilian, be fully valid and effective.
They shall be translated if they are to produce effects outside the jurisdiction of the judicial
bodies situated in the Autonomous Community, unless those effects will be produced in an
Autonomous Community with the same official language. They shall also be translated where
the law requires it or at the request of a party claiming to be without defence.
5. During oral proceedings, the Court may, by order, appoint as interpreter any person who
knows the language used, after that person has sworn or promised to provide a faithful
translation."

This lays down the linguistic profiles for each profession: judicial officials (linguistic profile
2), officers of the court (linguistic profile 3) and forensic pathologists (linguistic profile 3 or
4, according to the profile of the applicants). This linguistic ability requirement is
supplemented by two instruments: language classes, and programmes to promote Euskera
among Clerks of the Court and Public Prosecutors:
"Section 14. 1. The Department with competence with respect to judicial authorities shall take
appropriate measures to facilitate the linguistic proficiency of the civil servants working in
the Judicial Administration to which this Decree refers."
"Section 18. The Department with competence with respect to judicial authorities shall

Clerks of the Court. It takes knowledge of regional languages into account.
- Royal Decree 2397/1998 of 6 November on Replacement of Deputy Public Prosecutors.
Knowledge of regional languages is taken into account.

C) OTHER MEASURES ADOPTED BY PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS
- Cooperation instruments between the Autonomous Communities and the Judiciary for the
promotion of regional languages in this field.
The unitary conception of the Judiciary and its organic and functional independence mean
that measures the Autonomous Communities may adopt in this field are dependent upon the
cooperation with the Judicial Administration. The measures adopted are therefore ways,
usually voluntary, of facilitating learning of the regional languages.
- Cooperation Agreement signed by the A.C. of Catalonia and the General Council of the
Judiciary on 25 March 1999 on making knowledge of Catalan an advantage for entry to the
competitive examinations for appointment to posts as judges and magistrates in Catalonia.
- Courses for learning or improving regional languages.
- The relevant Civil Service Training Institutes, which all autonomous Communities have,
usually undertake this sort of action. For example, in 2001 the A.C. of Catalonia ran a total of
50 courses with 879 students enrolled.
- In 2000, the A.C. of Catalonia also developed a pilot scheme for the use of Catalan in the
offices of 40 Clerks of Courts, which resulted in the drafting of a total of 11,717 judgements
in Catalan and 2,416 in Castilian.
- Grants to study and research legal and administrative terminology. The aim is to make it
possible to have available a precise and sufficiently developed terminology, above all in a
field as fundamental as the administration of justice.
- The A.C. of Galicia gives this type of aid to non-profit-making Galician legal and
administrative institutions. Actions eligible for a subsidy are activities in Galician that further
the study, research and development of legal and administrative terminology in the
Autonomous Community.
79

- Monitoring the use of regional languages in notarial documents, usually in collaboration
with the Notaries Association.

- In 2001, 9.8% of notarial documents were in Catalan, as compared to 6.1% in 1998,
although there are marked differences between the different regions of the Autonomous
Community, the percentage being 25.8% in Gerona.

- Monitoring the use of regional languages in Public Registers.

- Here again, the data for Catalonia vary widely from one region to another, since they range
from 74.1% in Berga to 4% in Vilanova and Geltrú.

- Monitoring the use of regional languages in statutes.
- The data available on the use of Catalan in Catalonia are again the most precise. The
percentages of statutes recorded in Catalan in 2001 were as follows: statutes of foundations
(82.4%), statutes of associations (95%), statutes of cooperatives (65%) and statutes of
professional limited companies (25%).
ARTICLE 10. ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
- State legislation/measures
- Act 4/1999 of 13 January amending Act 30/1992 of 26 November on the Legal Status of
Public Administrations and Common Administrative Procedure.
It lays down the general rule that the language of the General Administration is Castilian, but
then provides that the regional languages may also be used. With regard to the Autonomous
Communities, the Act refers to the respective Acts:
"section 36. 1. The language in procedures dealt with by the General State Administration
shall be Castilian. Without prejudice to the foregoing, persons who address bodies of the
General State Administration situated within the territory of an Autonomous Community shall
also be able to use its co-official language. In this case, the procedure shall be dealt with in
the language chosen by the person concerned. Where there is more than one person involved
81

in the procedure, and if there is disagreement as to language, the procedure shall be dealt
with in Castilian, although the documents or certificates required by the persons concerned
shall be written in the language of their choice.
2. In procedures dealt with by the administrations of the Autonomous Communities and local
authorities, the language used shall be in accordance with the provisions of the relevant
autonomous legislation.
3. The public administration dealing with the procedure shall translate into Castilian
documents, files or parts of files where they are to produce effects outside the territory of the
Autonomous Community and documents for interested parties who expressly request them. If
they are to produce effects in an Autonomous Community where the language that is
co-official with Castilian is the same, it shall not be necessary to translate them."
This section reflects the provisions of Section 35 of the same Act, paragraph (d) of which
gives citizens the right, in their relations with public administrations, to "use the official
languages in the territory of their Autonomous Community" and includes in the term "public

- State Authorities Act 4/2001 of 12 November on the Right to Petition. It opts for wide use of
co-official languages in the Autonomous Communities where they are legally recognised, as
well as for the possibility of choosing the place in which to exercise the right and submit a
petition. More concretely, Section 5, on the use of co-official languages, provides:
"1. Within the territory of the Autonomous Communities whose Statutes establish linguistic
co-officiality, applicants shall have the right to draft their petitions to the General State
Administration and public bodies linked with or supervised by them in one of the official
languages and to obtain a reply in the language of their choice.
2. In petitions addressed to autonomous institutions and local authorities, the use of the
language shall be in accordance with the provisions of the relevant autonomous legislation.
3. The public administration dealing with the procedure shall translate into Castilian
documents, files or parts of files where they are to produce effects outside the territory of the
Autonomous Community and documents for interested parties who expressly request them. If
they are to produce effects in an Aut onomous Community where the language that is
co-official with Castilian is the same, it shall not be necessary to translate them."

language different from Castilian.
- Royal Decree 1465/1999 of 17 September laying down Institutional Image Criteria
regulating the Production of Documents and Printed Materials for the General State
Administration.
This provides that internal signposting and printed documents used in the General State
Administration must be bilingual in territories with a vernacular co-official language.

- Laws and other measures adopted by the Autonomous Communities
Autonomous Acts generally lay down that general provisions should be published in both coofficial languages. They also lay down guarantees that the public may address the
administration and receive assistance in one of the co-official languages.
In some cases, they provide for the language training and proficiency of civil servants, while
in others, such as the Act in force in Catalonia, it is assumed that civil servants know both
languages.
The Acts usually refer to their use by the autonomous administration, but they also include
recommendations for the local administration; in the case of Galicia, this takes the form of a
specific Act.
There follows a review of a number of matters and elements that have been regulated by the
Autonomous Communities. Although all the various legislative techniques used by the
different autonomous legislatures mean that this cannot be exhaustive, the references provided
are very useful for understanding the substance of the autonomous legislation in the
administrative sphere.

- State legislation/measures
- Act 17/1977 of 4 January amending Section 54 of the Act on the Civil Register of 8 June
1957.
"Section 54 of the Act on the Civil Register required that the names of Spaniards be entered in
Castilian. This rule is contrary to the deep-seated feelings of persons from the various
Spanish regions who are thus deprived of the possibility of their names being used in their
vernacular language, within and outside the family, as the official identity of the individual.
The purpose of this Act is to correct this situation, taking into account, on the one hand, the
fact that freedom in the choice of names should not, in principle, be limited in any way other
than respect for the dignity of the individual, and on the other, the protection and promotion
of the use of the various Spanish languages since they are all part of the indigenous
inheritance of our nation (…)
Section 1. Section 54, paragraph 1 of the Act in force on the Civil Register shall be worded as
follows:
The entry shall be the name given to the person born. With respect to Spaniards, names shall
be written in one of the Spanish languages."
"Section 2. At the request of the person concerned or his or her legal representative, the
Registry official shall replace the name, imposed before the entry into force of this Act, by its
equivalent name in one of the Spanish languages. The substitution shall be free of charge for
the persons concerned."
- Circular of 1 March 1984 of the General Directorate of Registers and Notaries on the
establishment by photocopy of exact copies from the Civil Register.

the second paragraph, may, at the discretion of the official or, if the applicant requests it, also
be in the official language of the Autonomous Community that supervises the Registry where
the certificate is issued."
In all cases, such bilingual copies shall be limited to the exact copies referred to in Article 26
of the Regulations on the Civil Register. In all other Civil Register activities, the Castilian
language alone shall continue to be used."
102

- Order of 18 April 1985 on renewal of the national identity card in order to replace the
holder's name by its equivalent in one of the Spanish languages.
"Firstly. For the purposes of replacing the holder's name by its translation into one of the
Spanish languages, national identity cards shall be renewed free of charge.
Secondly. When applying for renewal, interested parties shall be required to prove the change
by enclosing a certificate from the Civil Registry attesting to it, or through the official family
record book, if it is submitted, enclosing a photocopy of the page where the Civil Registry has
substituted the name so that, once they have been collated, they may be filed in the National
Identity Card database for the purposes of proof."
- Royal Decree 628/1987 of 8 May amending Articles 88 and 225 of the Regulations on the
Civil Register.

Article 86. In the case of documents not drafted in Castilian or in any of the other official
languages of the Autonomous Communities concerned, or papers in an archaic or
unintelligible hand, an adequate translation or copy shall be attached that has been
authenticated by a notary, consul, translator or other competent body or civil servant.
A translation shall not be required if the official has received proof of its content."

pages for Catalan and 32 pages for Basque."

- Laws and other measures adopted by the A.C. of Catalonia
- Act 1/1998 of 7 January on Language Policy.
Section 19. Personal names.
1. The citizens of Catalonia shall have the right to use the linguistically correct form of their
forenames and family names and to include the conjunction "i" between family names.
103

2. The persons concerned may have the linguistically correct forms of their forenames and
family names recorded in the Civil Register, whatever the date when they were originally
recorded, by making a declaration to the person responsible and submitting the documents
attesting to their linguistic accuracy, which shall be established in regulations.
3. This provision shall be applicable to Aranese forenames and family names in accordance
with the regulations governing the use of Aranese."

- State legislation/measures
- The references to powers in this field are very similar in all the Statutes of Autonomy of the
Autonomous Communities with a co-official language:
-

Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of the Basque Country, Article 19;
Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of Catalonia, Article 16;
Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of Galicia, Article 34;
Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia, Article 37;
Statute of Autonomy of the C.F. of Navarre, Article 55;
Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of the Balearic Islands, Article 11.11.

- Following the reform of the Statutes completed in 1999, there are similar references in the
Statutes of Autonomy of Communities with languages (other than Castilian) which are not coofficial:
- Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of the Asturias, Article 17;
- Statute of Autonomy of the A.C. of Aragon, Article 37.1(d).
The articles referred to regulate three different issues, which derive from the fact that the State
has essential powers with respect to radio and television broadcasting, in accordance with
Article 149.1.27 of the Constitution:
1. These Autonomous Communities have legislative and executive powers to develop the
laws governing radio and television broadcasting under the terms laid down by the Act
regulating Radio and Television.
2. They also have legislative and executive powers to develop the laws governing the press
and the media in general.
3. The Autonomous Communities may regulate, create and maintain their own television,

- Laws and other measures adopted by the Autonomous Communities
Autonomous Acts always lay down principles addressed to the respective governments for the
use of regional languages in publishing, theatre and film production. They go into detail on
the need to promote the presence of the regional language in the media, especially the radio
stations and television channels managed by the Autonomous Community.

As for radio programmes broadcast in regional languages, the autonomous public
corporations have radio stations as well as television channels, so the use of regional
languages in radio broadcasting is ensured through the use of various instruments, although
the very conception of radio facilitates the use of more than one language and there are often
bilingual programmes:
1. "General" public autonomous radio stations supervised by the public corporations
mentioned above. For example, in Catalonia, Catalunya Radio has a 26.4% audience share.
2. Private radio stations broadcasting in the regional languages, such as Ona Catalana with a
2.8% audience share in the Autonomous Community.
3. Municipal stations, of which there are 206 in Catalonia, 93.6% of programmes being in
Catalan.
- Laws and other measures adopted by the Basque Country

Autonomy of the Basque Country, which gives the Autonomous Community the right to

ETB2, the second autonomous channel, which broadcasts wholly in Castilian, began
broadcasting in 1986 without the formal adoption of any law or administrative act. Apart from
the questions of interpretation concerning each of these channels, they have not been given
the franchise for the third channel, as has been the case with Catalan and Galician television,
regulated by the 1983 Act giving the Autonomous Communities a Third Television Channel.

e. i. to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at least one
newspaper in the regional or minority languages.
g. to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using regional or minority
languages.
The existence of autonomous channels has sparked a rise in audiovisual production and
artistic expression in regional languages. This has had a very positive impact on language
standardisation, above all because of the social impact of television on regional languages
which in turn has had a very significant impact on the dissemination and learning of regional
languages.

ARTICLE 12. CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND FACILITIES
A) PARAGRAPHS AND OPTIONS CHOSEN

Paragraph 1.
1.
With regard to cultural activities and facilities – especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as
well as literary work and film production, vernacular forms of cultural expression,
festivals and the culture industries, including inter alia the use of new technologies –
the Parties undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used and to
the extent that the public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this
field:
a. to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to wo rks
produced in these languages;
b. to foster the different means of access in other languages to works produced
in regional or minority languages by aiding and developing translation,
dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;
c. to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced in other
languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing, postsynchronisation and subtitling activities;
d. to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting cultural
activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for incorporating the
knowledge and use of regional or minority languages and cultures in the
undertakings which they initiate or for which they provide backing;
e. to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or
supporting cultural activities have at their disposal staff who have a full
command of the regional or minority language concerned, as well as of the
language(s) of the rest of the population;
f. to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a given
regional or minority language in providing facilities and planning cultural
117

activities;
g. to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies responsible for
collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or publishing works produced in
the regional or minority languages;
h. if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to maintaining and
developing appropriate administrative, commercial, economic, social,
technical or legal terminology in each regional or minority language.
Paragraph 2.
In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority languages are
traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional or minority
language justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural activities
and facilities in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

Paragraph 3.
The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing their cultural policy
abroad, for regional or minority languages and the cultures they reflect.

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
1. Measures on Publishing and Reading
- Measures taken by the State
- Grants and Subsidies
The State has a policy of non-discrimination on the grounds of language when examining
applications for aid submitted for linguistic reasons, so that publications and activities in the
various co-official languages of Spain may receive subsidies, in accordance with the relevant
specifications:
- Grants to promote the translation into and publication in the official Spanish languages of
works by Spanish authors originally written and published in any other official Spanish
language. The objectives include promoting intercommunication between the different
Spanish cultures and fostering cohesion between Autonomous Communities. In 2002, 15
companies and 23 projects received such grants.
- Grants to promote the publishing of Spanish books for public libraries in the official Spanish
languages. They have two objectives: to increase the holdings of Spanish public libraries and
to promote and foster communication and cultural cohesion between Autonomous
Communities.
- Grants to enterprises and non-profit-making institutions publishing cultural journals. The
aim is to distribute cultural journals in the various official Spanish languages free of charge to
118

the libraries and cultural centres of Spain. The objectives are the same as those of the abovementioned grant s.
- Grants to promote the reading and dissemination of Spanish literature through activities to
encourage common Spanish culture, both in Spain and abroad, in congresses, seminars, etc,
participation in and holding commemorations and centenaries - particularly of writers – and
promotion of reading and the use of public libraries.
- Grants for translation into and publication in any other language of literary and academic
works by Spanish authors, originally written and published in one of the Spanish la nguages.
The objective is to disseminate and promote Spanish culture abroad.
- Presence at book fairs and sending books to Spanish cultural centres abroad.
When Spain is present at international book fairs, with its own pavilion or one managed
through its embassies, the new publications displayed include books and journals in all
Spanish languages, some of them resulting from grants for the publication of journals and
books. This is also the case with the books sent to libraries and cultural centres.
- National Prizes
The regulations on National Prizes awarded by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport
lay down that works and authors of all Spanish languages may be put forward.
Many such prizes have been awarded to books written and authors writing in languages other
than Castilian. For example, the National Prize for Spanish Literature has recently been
awarded to Miquel Batllori (2001), Martí de Riquer (2000) and Pere Gimferrer (1998), the
main representatives of culture in Catalan and Castilian.

Manuel Rivas' "Que me queres amor" (in Galician) won the 1996 National Literature Prize for
fiction. In the same year, Fina Casalderrey won the National Children's and Youth Literature
Prize for "O misterio dos fillos da lua" (in Galician). The previous year the prize was
awarded to Xavier Puente Docampo for "Cuando petan a porta pala noite" (in Galician).
In 1989, Bernardo Atxaga won the National Literature Prize for fiction with "Obabakoak" (in
Euskera). In 2001, the Best Translation Prize was awarded to the translation into Catalan of
Dante Alghieri's "Divine Comedy" by Joan Francesc Mira i Casterá.
The various academies and institutions of each of the co-official Spanish languages are
represented on the juries that offer and award prizes.
The same respect for linguistic and cultural diversity is reflected in other specific activities
that are not part of the major activities mentioned above, such as centenaries, anniversaries,
round tables, “Encuentros de Verines”, etc. For example, this year the centenary of the death
of the Catalan writer Jacint Verdague is being commemorated, a National Committee having
been created whose members include the Ministry, which is collaborating in the work and
activities.
119

The “Encuentros de Verines” (Verines Symposium), which have a different theme each year,
bring together writers and critics of the different Spanish languages and literatures, since they
were created to be a pluralistic platform for encounter and mutual understanding.
Writers in every Spanish la nguage take part in activities at national and international level.
- Measures taken by the A.C. of the Basque Country
- Order of 18 April 2000 of the Department of Culture on the granting of subsidies for

distribution of books in Galician during reading campaigns;
readings by Galician authors;
publication of books in Galician;

120

- Eladio Rodríguez Gonzále z Year. Decree 10/2001 declared 2001 Eladio Rodríguez
González Year. González' philological and ethnographic work made a major contribution to
knowledge about Galicia and the Galician language.
- Galician Literature Day, in accordance with the provisions of the Order of 27 February 2002
providing instructions for holding this day in non- university teaching establishments.
- Measures taken by the C.F. of Navarre
- Providing libraries with holdings in Basque. Under the terms of Article 12 of the foral
regulating decree, the General Directorate of Culture will provide books in Basque to 38
public libraries, in addition to the General Library of Navarre.
- Grants for the acquisition of literary works written in or translated into Euskera.
- Grants to private companies for the translation of textbooks from Castilian and for the
publication of textbooks on the environment for primary education.

The following figures give an idea of the number of books published in the languages spoken
in Spain 21 :
- In Castilian/Spanish
- In Catalan and/or Valencian
- In Galician
- In Euskera
- In other languages
- In non-Spanish languages
- In different languages
- Total

49,500 titles 79.17%
6,669 titles 10.67%
1,231 titles
1.97%
885 titles
1.42%
89 titles
0.14%
2,440 titles
3.9%
1,711 titles 2.74%
62,525 titles

More detailed analysis of these data gives rise to a number of observations of interest for
assessing the promotion of regional languages in Spain:
1. After Castilian, production in Catalan and/or Valencian is clearly the largest. An analysis of
the subject matter of the titles published shows that the category literature, history and literary
criticism accounts for the highest number of pub lications, with 2,406 titles, ie 13.13%,
followed by natural sciences, with 387 titles, representing 17.58% of the total.
2. As for type or category of books, the largest is text books with 25.07% published in
Catalan, 5.91% in Galician and 4.88% in Euskera.
3. University theses published in languages other than Castilian: 23.3% in Catalan and/or
Valencian, 0.28% in Euskera and virtually zero in Galician.

4. Measures to coordinate libraries
- Measures taken by the State
The Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport and the Autonomous Communities jointly
maintain an information service on the Internet called, "Ask and the libraries will answer".
The service can be consulted in all the official languages.
It is also planned to translate the Rules of Cataloguing into Euskera, in principle through the
signing of an agreement with the Basque Government.
- Measures taken by the Autonomous Communities
The Autonomous Communities have their own networks of libraries and help to manage staterun libraries by monitoring book production in the regional languages.
5. Measures on archive management
- Measures taken by the State
- With respect to the Archives of the Crown of Aragon in Barcelona, Catalan legislation on
language standardisation is applied. The following measures have been taken:
-

-

internal and external signs are in Catalan and Castilian;
public information, whether oral or written, and printed material and other official
communications are bilingual, in Catalan and Castilian;
the descriptive material available to the public in the reading room is in both Catalan and
Castilian;
the academic publications of the Archives and its staff are in Catalan or Castilian,
depending on the journal in which they appear. The last inventory, the General Bailía of
Catalonia which is now printing, is bilingual;
Every year the Delegation of the Government in Catalonia runs Catalan courses for
Archive staff.

- With respect to the Provincial Archives under the supervision of the Ministry of Education,
Culture and Sport, situated in the Basque Country:
-

internal and external signs are in Euskera and Castilian;
printed materials and official written communications have headings in Euskera and
Castilian.

6. Other Measures to Promote the Use of Regional Languages
Some of the Autonomous Communities have developed activities for the direct promotion of
their respective regional languages. Here, we will consider not only the cultural activities that
may take place in the regional language but also those whose direct purpose is to subsidise the
use of the regional language per se.

123

- Measures taken by the A.C. of the Basque Country
- Subsidies for cultural activities. The Department of Culture Order of 7 June 2000 provides
for subsidies for cultural activities, on application by public or private natural or legal
persons. The budget for 2001 was 1,123,892.64 euros.
The criterion applied to applications is "the development of the activity with the use of the two
co-official languages of the Basque Autonomous Community. This criterion shall not be
applied where the nature of the activity is to promote and develop Euskera. It shall be
evaluated at up to 10% of the total number of points".
The obligations incumbent upon the persons or bodies receiving subsidies include: "4.
Mentioning in the promotional materials and in texts and documents drafted for the
subsidised activity, which shall be published in Euskera, without prejudice to the use of other
languages, the sponsorship of the Department of Culture of the Basque Government".
- Subsidies for the promotion, dissemination and/or standardisation of Euskera. These are
regulated by the Department of Culture Order of 16 August 2000 on the granting of subsidies
to private legal persons undertaking the promotion, dissemination and/or standardisation of
Euskera.
The Order of 22 May 2002 has amended the Order for the purposes of its application in the
2002 financial year, when 805,356.22 euros were allocated for subsidies, although the overall
sum allocated may be amended to take account of the total amount of subsidies applied for
and the surplus funds available from other Department of Culture aid programmes.
- Subsidies to local authorities for the development of the General Plan for the Promotion and
Use of Euskera by those authorities. They are regulated by the Order of 31 July 2000 on the
allocation of subsidies to local authorities under the jurisdiction of the Autonomous
Community of the Basque Country and the bodies answerable or linked to them, for the
introduction or improvement of language standardisation services and the development of the
General Plan for the Promotion and Use of Euskera at the level of the authority.
The Order was amended for the purposes of its application in the financial year 2002 by the
Order of 22 May 2002. The amount allocated for subsidies in 2002 was 601,012 euros, which
may be amended to take into account the total amount of subsidies applied for and the surplus
funds available from other Department of Culture aid programmes.
- Subsidies to develop Euskera Plans in private sector bodies. The Order of 10 July 2002 has
amended the Order of 18 October 2000 and provides for subsidies for the development of
Euskera Plans. It states, "The Euskera Plans shall establish which of the external and/or
internal relations of the body shall be undertaken in Euskera within three years".
The budget for 2002 was 661,282.78 euros and the beneficiaries are legally constituted private
legal persons or public- law corporations. The following actions are subsidised:

124

(a) the adaptation of texts in Euskera (…);
(b) Euskera training for staff directly linked with the plan's objectives and the replacement of
staff attending Euskera classes who are responsible for written communication with public
administrations;
(c) the purchase or adaptation of computer applications in order to be able to work in
Euskera;
(d) drawing up the plan, communication activities connected with it, follow-up and evaluation
of the plan.
- Subsidies for Basque Centres – Euskal Etxeak – for the development of activities connected
with promoting the use of Euskera in Basque Centres within and outside the territory of the
Autonomous Community.
- Grants for school activities to support oral expression.
- Grants for residential language courses.
- Subsidies to promote extra-curricular activities.

- Measures taken by the A.C. of Catalonia
- Subsidies for the introduction or maintenance of Catalan language training.
These are regulated by the Order of 11 May 2000. Applications may be made each year by
commercial bodies and private, non-profit- making bodies. The purpose is to promote the use
of Catalan in social, professional, commercial and cultural activities and in advertising, sport,
games, the voluntary sector and any other type of activity. The maximum grant is 21,000
euros, which may be increased according to the applications received and funds available.
- Subsidies for the maintenance of language services to promote the Catalan language in
private non-profit- making organisations and bodies.
The beneficiaries are non-profit- making private organisations and bodies. Like those
mentioned above, the purpose of these subsidies is to promote the use of Catalan in social,
professional, commercial and cultural activities and in advertising, sport, games, the voluntary
sector and any other type of activity. The maximum subsidy is 380,000 euros, which may be
increased according to the applications received and funds available.
- Subsidies to professional associations and private non-profit- making bodies for initiatives to
promote the learning and social use of the Catalan language.
The purpose is to promote the use of Catalan in social, professional, commercial and cultural
activities and in advertising, sport, games, the voluntary sector and any other type of activity.
The maximum grant is 120,000 euros, which may be increased according to the applications
received and funds available.

125

- Measures adopted by the A.C. of Galicia
The General Directorate for Cultural Promotion of the Autonomous Government of Galicia
provides a number of cultural activities and services to promote the use of Galician as the
vernacular language. In addition to the provisions mentioned above with respect to promoting
publishing and reading in Galician, there are a number of other measures.
- Measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting various forms of
cultural activity make appropriate use of Galician:
-

in relations with all the institutions of Galicia, and
in activities financed or subsidised by the Department.

- Subsidies to "Casas" (houses) of Galicia and Galician Centres. Cultural activities to defend
or promote Galician are also conducted in territories other than those where Galician is
traditionally spoken. This is the case of the many "Casas de Galicia" and Galician Centres in
America and elsewhere in the world, where cultural activities are organised fo r this purpose.
There are also subsidies for universities offering teaching in Galician in the form of books and
aid through collaboration agreements.
- Subsidies to non-profit- making bodies and associations promoting the social use of the
Galician language.
The aim is to collaborate economically with non-profit- making associations and institutions
developing actions to foster the wider social use of Galician. Beneficiaries are non-profitmaking bodies and associations, as well as local authority bodies, legally constituted in or
outside the Autonomous Community.
Actions eligible for subsidy are activities to promote the Galician language, priority being
given to those in which Galician is permanently present and to on- going language assistance
activities; the organisation of symposia, congresses and conferences.
For the financial year 2000, they were regulated by the Order of 17 January 2000 and had a
total budget of 601,012 euros.
- Subsidies to private enterprises to promote the use of the Galician language.
Under the terms of the Order of 26 November 1996, their objective is to promote the use of
Galician as the vernacular language of Galicia in private enterprises, the A.C. of Galicia
recognising that private enterprises are able to promote wider use of Galician through their
action and territorial and social presence. Beneficiaries are legally constituted private
enterprises, and actions eligible for subsidy are the use of Galician in documentation and
public information and permanent external and internal signposting.
The Steering Committee for Language Standardisation in Galicia encourages enterprises to
promote the use of the Galician language by introducing it into the economic and commercial
sphere. The objective of the Council is to promote the use of Galician in commercial activity
and advertising in order to implement the provisions of the Act, and it considers it appropriate

126

to supervise the measures and economic and administrative procedures necessary for the
granting of subsidies.
For the financial year 2000, it was regulated by the Order of 18 January 2000 and had a total
budget of 601,012 euros.
The actions financed are promotional actions correctly undertaken in Galician under the
legislation in force. Funding of the enterprise's ordinary working materials is excluded.
All the promotional documents and graphic information produced by the company must be in
Galician.
The actions eligible are:
1.
2.
3.
4.

the promotion of the Galician language in permanent actions;
Galician language courses for staff;
standardisation of company documents;
the modification, for their public use in Galician, of the company's trading name,
trademark, brand names and guarantee.

- Subsidies to non-profit- making bodies and institutions for courses. The Order of 13
November 1996 regulated the granting of subsidies to non-profit- making bodies and
institutions for courses and other training activities in the Galician language.
The purpose is to respond to an important section of society that is particularly sensitive to the
language and culture of Galicia, namely the non-profit- making bodies and institutions that
bring together citizens who, by using it, give Galician the necessary social prestige to
stimulate its use. Local councils are not eligible for such subsidies.
Beneficiaries are therefore non-profit- making bodies and associations (excluding local
administration bodies) that are legally constituted within or outside the Autonomous
Community. The purpose of the subsidy is the organisation and provision of classes and other
training activities in the Galician language, completely free of charge. The maximum total
amount of such subsidies for 1996 was 216,364 euros. The actions eligible for subsidy are
beginners' and advanced Galician language courses and other training activities.
- Subsidies to Royal Academies, professional associations, entrepreneurs' associations,
chambers of commerce and similar bodies for activities to promote the Galician language.
Under the Order of 5 November 1996, activities to promote the Galician language that
develop specific projects or organise different activities for the same purpose are eligible for
subsidy. For this reason, preference is given to on- going activities of practical importance for
the promotion of the language, with a major impact on occasional, practical activities.
Beneficiaries are Royal Academies, professional associations, entrepreneurs' associations,
chambers of commerce and similar non-profit- making bodies legally constituted under the
laws regulating them but exclusing those supervised by local authorities.
The aim of the subsidies is the mounting of promotional activities that seek to give the
Galician language greater presence in the spheres of activity of the beneficiaries mentioned.

127

The maximum total amount was 240,964 euros in 1997. The maximum amount of each
subsidy was 24,096 euros.
Subsidies are conditional upon activities' using the Galician language correctly as an official
language. The financing of ordinary working materials is excluded.
The preferential criteria for granting subsidies are as follows:
1. the sphere in which the activity is being conducted, considered from a quantitative as well
as a qualitative point of view;
2. the clarity of presentation of the project, essentially in terms of the activities planned, their
link with the dissemination of the Galician language and evidence that they are likely to
achieve the objectives set;
3. the sustainability over time of the results it is hoped the activities will achieve.
- Measures taken by the Community of Valencia
- Subsidies for activities to promote Valencian undertaken by the "Hogeuras Committees".
- Subsidies for activities to promote the use of the Valencian language undertaken by the
"Fallas Committees".
- Subsidies for activities to promote the use of Valencian in Feasts of Magdalena.
- Measures taken by the C.F. of Navarre
- Organisation of cultural activities and services. The use of Basque/Euskera by the
Administration of the C.F. of Navarre is regulated by Foral Decree 372/2000 of 11 December
and the Directorate General of Culture organises cultural activities and services under the
terms of this Decree.
Most of the activities resulting from the Decree concern the promotion of publishing and
reading, but it also provides for subsidies for cultural activities, whether in Castilian or
Euskera.
- Subsidies for local councils, regulated by the Foral Decree of 25 January 1990, for
programmes in implementation of the Foral Act on Basque.
- Measures taken by the A.C. of the Asturias
The Finance Act for 2002 includes a specific budgetary programme, "422 R, Promotion of
Asturian", which provides for the following measures:
-

subsidies for the promotion of Asturian in local authorities, private bodies, associations
and the media;
subsidies for the promotion of films and music in Asturian;
a specific subsidy for the Academy of the Asturian Language;
campaigns to promote language standardisation;
support for the use of traditional place- names;
promotion of the administrative use of Asturian;

128

-

award of a literary prize for poetry, non- fiction, fiction and publishing in Asturian;
subsidies for the promotion of publishing in Asturian;
subsidies to promote translation;
organisation of cultural activities particularly connected with the use of Asturian: Asturian
Literature Week, Writers' Assembly and Asturian Book Day;
promotion of the study of the situation of Asturian through joint activities with the
Academy of the Asturian Language and the University of Oviedo.

ARTICLE 13. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE
A) PARAGRAPHS AND OPTIONS CHOSEN

Paragraph 1.
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, within the whole
country:
b. to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or limiting without
justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority languages in documents relating to
economic or social life, particularly contracts of employment, and in technical
documents such as instructions for the use of products or installations;
c. to prohibit the insertion in internal regulations of companies and private documents
of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of regional or minority languages, at
least between users of the same language;
d. to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or minority languages
in connection with economic or social activities;
e. to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority languages by means
other than those specified in the above sub-paragraphs.

Paragraph 2.
With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, in so far as the public
authorities are competent, within the territory in which the regional or minority languages
are used, and as far as this is reasonably possible:
f. to include in their financial and banking regulations provisions which allow, by
means of procedures compatible with commercial practice, the use of regional or
minority languages in drawing up payment orders (cheques, drafts, etc.) or other
financial documents, or, where appropriate, to ensure the implementation of such
provisions;
g. in the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public sector), to
organise activities to promote the use of regional or minority languages;
h. to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes and hostels
offer the possibility of receiving and treating in their own language persons using a
regional or minority language who are in need of care on grounds of ill- health, old
age or for other reasons;
i. to ensure by appropriate means that safety instructions are also drawn up in regional
or minority languages;
j. to arrange for information provided by the competent public authorities concerning
the rights of consumers to be made available in regional or minority languages.

129

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
Application of the measures provided for in this article depends to a great extent on the will of
individuals, people who speak the languages and social players, rather than the authorities.
On the other hand, the EU principles on the single market and the free movement of persons
and goods within the Community to a great extent govern the exercise of the right to use
regional and minority languages. For example, a number of studies have noted how in some
cases the requirement for labelling in a particular regional language can become a logistic
problem for companies since it forces them to adapt the distribution chain of the product.
- State legislation/measures
For this reason, it does not seem necessary to enumerate specific State laws, State obligations
being considered adequate since the law contains no principles making it a duty to use a
particular language or to prevent the use of other co-official languages in the development of
social and economic relations.
- Laws and other measure s adopted by the Autonomous Communities
Nevertheless, autonomous legislation and regulations on language standardisation, the express
purpose of which is to promote the use of the regional languages concerned, usually lay down
principles that aim to promote the social use of the respective languages, although the laws
cannot have a great deal of force for the reasons mentioned above.
They therefore usually refer to promotion of the use of the regional language in certain
specific aspects of public life, though this is not always easy to put into practice, especially in
a predominantly bilingual environment such as that of Spain.
The measures necessary to guarantee the exercise of linguistic rights are therefore necessarily
limited and dispersed in legislation, although they can be divided into three types of
references: those in legislation on language, those contained in specific sectoral, socioeconomic legislation and measures taken by the autonomous administrations.

135

Centre TERMCAT for language standardisation, and through the Social Council of the
Catalan Language, created by the Decree of 18 February 1991.
- In the field of relations between the autonomous administration and social players, a
mechanism for evaluating and certifying knowledge of the Catalan language has been put in
place and is regulated by Decree 152/2001 of 29 May. Article 1 states that "the purpose is to
regulate certificates of knowledge of Catalan and the examinations for obtaining them in the
context of the regulated study of Catalan".
- Measures adopted by the A.C. of Galicia
- The social protection of Galician, particularly among Galicians outside the region, has been
dealt with through the creation of the Council of Galician Culture, whose terms of reference
were approved in Decree 237/2000 of 29 September and whose task is "to defend and
promote the cultural values of the Galician people".
- Measures adopted by the C.F. of Navarre
- It should be noted that the Foral Community has adopted two specific Action Plans for the
different geographical areas of the Community, specifying the actions to be undertaken:
1. Action Plan for the Application of the Regulations on the Use of Basque in the Mixed
Area, approved by the Government Council on 8 January 2001.
2. Action Plan for the Application of the Re gulations on the Use of Basque in the Basquespeaking Area, approved by the Government Council on 8 January 2001.
- Measures adopted by the A.C. of the Balearic Islands
- The Order of 13 January 2000 published the Pact on Employment, Social Cohesion and the

entitled "Encouragement of Language Standardisation", which states that "the parties
consider the activation and encouragement of the social use of Catalan as the vernacular
language of this Community to be an instrument of cohesion and participation".
For this purpose, it provides for a number of measures, including the drawing up of a
Standardisation Plan, assistance for linguistic aspects, support for the translation and
correction of texts and the provision of Catalan courses.
ARTICLE 14. TRANSFRONTIER EXCHANGES
A) PARAGRAPHS AND OPTIONS CHOSEN
a. to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind them with the States
in which the same language is used in identical or similar form, or if necessary to seek
to conclude such agreements, in such a way as to foster contacts between the users of
the same language in the States concerned in the fields of culture, education,
information, vocational training and permanent education;
b. for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/ or promote cooperation across borders, in particular between regional or local authorities in whose
territory the same language is used in identical or similar form.
136

territory the same language is used in identical or similar form.

B) MEASURES TAKEN TO APPLY EACH PARAGRAPH
The application of Article 14 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
should be examined in conjunction with the Council of Europe Outline Convention on
Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities, done at Madrid
on 21 May 1980.
On the basis of the Convention, Spain signed and ratified a Treaty between the Kingdom of
Spain and the French Republic on Transfrontier Cooperation between Territorial Entities at
Bayonne on 10 March 1995.
The inter-state negotiation process particular to an international treaty makes the exercise of
linguistic rights subject to the positive law in force in each signatory State. The only reference
to the subject in this treaty is therefore the following:
"Article 6. (…) The Statutes and decisions of the Body shall be drafted in the languages whose
use is compulsory under the domestic law of each of the signatories for acts and decisions
made by the territorial entities".
Therefore, on the Spanish side, applying the constitutional and legal principles outlined in the
introductory chapter of this report, the statutes mentioned in Article 6 may be drafted in a coofficial language, so long as they are also drafted in Castilian/Spanish.
With respect to cooperation with the Portuguese Republic, at the time of writing, no final
agreement had yet been reached on the content of what will probably be an international
treaty similar to the one signed with the French Republic. It can be said, however, that the
linguistic conditions of the treaty are likely to be similar to those already in force with the
French Republic, ie the sub-state administrations will be free to draft the corresponding
collaboration agreements in a regional language, so long as they are also drafted in
Castilian/Spanish.
Under the provisions laid down in the Treaty of Bayonne, the transfrontier cooperation the
Spanish sub-state entities maintain with their French counterparts usually involves the use of
the corresponding regional languages, ie Euskera and Catalan, depending on the area.
For example, Article 31 of the Statutes of the Bidassoa-Txingudi Transfrontier Consortium,
approved on 23 December 1998, which brings together the municipalities of Hendaye
(France), Hondarribia (Spain, Basque Country) and Irun (Spain, Basque Country), refers to
the use of languages and lays down that "The Statutes, agendas, minutes and official
correspondence of the Bidassoa-Txingudi Transfrontier Consortium shall be drafted in
Spanish, French and Euskera".
