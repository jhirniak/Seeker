EUROPEAN CHARTER FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES

Third periodical report
presented to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe
in accordance with Article 15 of the Charter

SPAIN

2

The third report of the Kingdom of Spain for the period 2006-2009 on compliance with the
European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages aims to comply with the provisions
contained in Article 15 of the aforementioned Charter, which, after indicating that the first
report must be presented within the year following the entry into force of the Charter, adds
that subsequent reports shall be presented to the Secretary General of the Council of
Europe at three-yearly intervals after the first report. It should be remembered that since
the Charter came into force in Spain on 1 August 2001, the first report was presented in
2002 and the second report for the period 2002-2005 in 2006.

The report attempts to address the issues raised by the Committee of Experts regarding
the previous report, as well as the recommendations formulated by the Committee of
Ministers.

The report shows that Spain has made considerable progress in terms of accomplishing its
commitments under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and
reveals that plurilinguisim is one of the key features of Autonomous Spain, generating
cultural, social and economic wealth, and a common heritage that must be respected and
promoted, not only to fulfil the aforementioned commitments deriving from the Charter, but
also to properly meet the corresponding constitutional, statutory and legal requirements of
the Spanish State.

As indicated in different parts of the report, it was prepared with the collaboration of and
information provided by many different institutions, including most notably the Autonomous
Communities concerned, the cities with Statutes of Autonomy, the ministerial departments
of the Spanish Government, as well as other public and private institutions that have also
been consulted accordingly in this respect.

The preparation of the report was coordinated by the Ministry of Territorial Policy through
the Directorate General for Cooperation with the Autonomous Communities.

The comparison with the previous report for 2005 shows that the total Spanish population
has grown, due in particular to the continual increase in immigration in recent years.

The population grew significantly in the Autonomous Communities of Catalonia, Valencia
and the Balearic Islands. This growth was undoubtedly linked to increased immigration to
these territories.

The number of foreigners resident in Spain in 2005 and 2009 was as follows:

The most relevant statistic regarding the use of regional or minority languages is the high
percentage of foreigners in Catalonia and Valencia, which, together with the Community of
Madrid, have the highest percentages with respect to the national total. This result is
important because these Autonomous Communities have two recognised co-official
languages - Catalan and Valencian - and the increase in the foreign population has
prompted a decrease in the percentage of Catalan and Valencian-speakers since the
publication of the previous report.

The data show that there continue to be differences in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of the different Autonomous Communities. Eight Autonomous Communities lead the list
with GDP above the European Union (EU) average. These are the Basque Country,
Madrid, Navarre, Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, La Rioja, Aragon and Cantabria. In
contrast, Extremadura, Andalusia, Castilla-La Mancha and the Region of Murcia, in the
south of the country, rank at the bottom of the list. The trend has been maintained in both
cases.

INFORMATION ON LANGUAGES IN SPAIN
12

1.3.1

CATALAN

1.3.1.1 CATALAN IN THE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF CATALONIA

Catalan is a language spoken by more than 9,000,000 people in different European states,
such as Spain, Andorra, France and Italy (Sardinia). “Catalan-speakers” are persons who
know and can speak Catalan.

Focusing specifically on the territory of Catalonia, set forth below are details of the
proficiency in, and habitual use of, Catalan in different areas compared with the other
languages spoken in Catalonia.

The data were obtained from the 2008 Survey on Language Uses of the Population in
Catalonia. This is an official four-yearly survey carried out by the Statistics Institute of
Catalonia in collaboration with the Secretariat of Language Policy of the Generalitat de
Catalunya (Autonomous Community Government of Catalonia). The technical details of
the survey are presented below:
-

Universe: population resident in Catalonia for 15 years or more.

-

Theoretical sample of 7,300 persons, with an error of 1.32% for global results and a
confidence interval of 95.5%.

Compared with the same official survey conducted in 2003, it is important to mention that
the design of the sample was changed in order to correct the excessively low presence of
immigrants, linked to traditional approach associated with the use of fixed telephone
numbers. The 2008 survey improves on this methodology, enabling the sample to provide
more accurate data on the languages used by new residents in Catalonia.

This is particularly important for understanding the data and their evolution, since the
number of immigrants in Catalonia is very high. In 2008, the number of foreign-born
residents in Catalonia exceeded one million persons for the first time. This culminated a
process of strong growth in the immigrant population, as indicated in the following graph:

The graph shows that more people have knowledge of Castilian (Spanish) than Catalan
(99.9% can understand Spanish and 95.6% can write in Spanish), although it is also worth
noting that almost all citizens in Catalonia stated that they understand Catalan (94.6) and a
significant 81% said that they can read in Catalan.
The percentage of people claiming to have knowledge of Catalan is slightly lower than that
reported in 2008, as a result of the increase in the foreign population, as shown in the
following graph:

As regards interest in learning Catalan, more than 2.5 million people stated that they were
interested in learning or improving their knowledge of Catalan. Of these, it is significant
that more than 720,000 people born abroad (68.7% of total immigrants) expressed an
interest in learning Catalan.

Before presenting the data gathered in the official reference survey on initial language or
language of identification, in order to provide greater clarity in the interpretation of these
data it is necessary to define the concepts used in the aforementioned survey on language
use in Catalonia in 2008:
-

Initial language: this is the language the interviewee said that he/she spoke first at
home. It is held that this language has been transmitted through the family and
acquired in the individual’s socialisation process. It is also referred to as the “first
language” or “L1”.

-

Identification language: the language that the interviewee considered to be his/her
language. It is the language which he/she claims to identify with in response to the
question “What is your language?”

-

Usual language: the language that the interviewee uses most frequently. This
15

language may or may not be the initial and/or identification language.

Therefore, if the initial language is the language learned at home and transmitted through
the family, the results of the survey show that Spanish is the initial language with the
strongest presence in Catalonia, followed by Catalan. However, the percentages for
Spanish and Catalan are very similar in terms of identification language and usual
language, which means that a significant percentage of the interviewees whose language
during early childhood was Spanish, nevertheless stated that their usual language now,
and the one with which they identified most, is Catalan, or either Spanish or Catalan. This
is shown in the following table:

We will initially focus on the first concept: initial language. The following graph compares
data recorded in 2008 and in 2003 in the same official survey, showing a decrease of 5%

The following graph shows again the three concepts of initial, identification and usual
language (this time in percentage terms). This confirms the abovementioned trend of
“adoption” of Catalan by persons who did not have this as their initial language. As can be
seen, the number of persons with Catalan as their identification language (37.2%) is
greater than the number with Catalan as their initial language (31.6%). The total number of
people who said that Catalan was their usual language (35.6%) is also greater than the
number with Catalan as their initial language (31.6%).

By age groups, a higher percentage of young people use either Catalan or Spanish
(14.4%). The only group in which similar percentages of people stated that their usual
language is Catalan or Spanish was the older group (45%). In the other age brackets,
Spanish is the main habitual language if compared with Catalan, although the percentages
would be on a par with those for Spanish if persons habitually using either Spanish or
Catalan were included:

The habitual use of Catalan is logically significantly greater among the population born in
Catalonia. A large percentage of the population born abroad (estranger) are habitual
speakers of languages other than the official languages in Catalonia:

The comparison with 2003 figures shows a decrease in the percentage of persons with
Catalan as their habitual language (not in absolute terms), and a very strong increase in
the percentage of people using either “Catalan or Spanish” as their habitual language:

Another very significant result regarding the health of the Catalan language is worth
highlighting: in Catalonia there is an intergenerational transmission process that is
favourable for the Catalan language insofar as the exclusive or majority (només or
sobretot) use of Catalan with children (41.7%) is greater than the use of Catalan with
parents (32%). This means that persons whose parents spoke to them in a language other
than Catalan nevertheless chose Catalan as the language to communicate with their
children. The survey uses the eldest child (fill més gran) as a reference, as the index
measuring the intention to transmit a language. The graph also shows that Spanish is the
main language in the intergenerational transmission process.

At interpersonal level, 48.7% use Catalan with their fellow students (companys d’estudi),
and around 33% use Catalan in relations with work colleagues (companys de feina),
friends (amistats) and neighbours (veïns). It is also worth noting that between 19% and
16% of people use both Catalan and Spanish in such relations. The percentages are
lower in the case of writing personal notes, which coincides with greater oral than written
skills in the language.

In terms of consumption and services, Catalan is used more often in the financial sector
(bancs i caixes – banks), with doctors (metge) and in small shops (petit comerç), but less

In addition to these institutional bodies, it should be mentioned as regards private
associations that since 2002 the Generalitat has compiled a census of non-profit entities
that promote the use of the Catalan language. It has introduced a rebate on the income tax
of individuals (amounting to 15% on the amounts donated up to a maximum of 10% of the
figure for the Autonomous Community as a whole). Under the regulations for this census,
promotion of Catalan means “the carrying out of activities promoting positive attitudes to
Catalan or designed to increase the knowledge or use of Catalan in the population at large
or specific groups, as well as research on the Catalan language or its situation”.

The organisations included in the Census of entities whose purpose is to promote Catalan
are mentioned in Resolution VCP/2371/2008, of 15 July (DOGC (Official Journal of the

The Report on the situation of the Catalan language was published in 2009. This report
was prepared by the Observatory of the Catalan Language in order to monitor and assess
the Catalan language. The report was prepared in collaboration with the CRUSCAT
[acronym for Knowledge, Representations and Uses of Catalan] network of the Institute of
Catalan Studies (IEC). It draws on data from the Statistics on Language Use for 2003,

1.3.2 GALICIAN

Approximately two million people are habitual speakers of Galician and another half a
million use Galician as their second language in the Autonomous Community of Galicia.
There are also Galician speakers in the most western parts of the neighbouring provinces
of Asturias, Leon and Zamora and in three municipalities in Caceres. Due to Galician
emigration, large concentrations of Galician-speakers still live in other regions in Spain
(Madrid, Barcelona, the Basque Country and the Canary Islands), Europe (Portugal,
France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and Holland) and in America
(Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico and the United States).

As regards self-perceived language skills in the two official languages of Galicia, Galician
and Spanish, the following graphs show that Galician society has general knowledge of
Spanish because almost all the persons interviewed stated that they can write, read,
speak and understand Spanish, while command of Galician is lower, mainly in writing and
reading that language.

In the case of Galician, the lowest percentages of language knowledge correspond to
reading and writing because many people do not study Galician language at school. This
situation is slowly changing, as indicated in the following graph, which shows the evolution
of Galician writing, reading and speaking skills by age group.

As regards the results for initial language, i.e. the first language learned by individuals at
home during childhood and spoken at the beginning of their lives, the data available for the
period 2006-2008 show that Galician is still the initial language of a very large proportion of
Galicians, 57.6% of the total population of Galicia to be precise.

The following main conclusions may be drawn regarding the distribution of the initial
language:

• As regards age, clear differences were observed between the different age groups
identified, showing that Galician was less present as the initial language among younger
people. This finding may be qualified by adding that although an evident decrease was
observed in the use of Galician as the initial language among younger generations, this
trend has stagnated and even recovered slightly in the two youngest age groups (15-24
and 25-34).

• Education level also has an important influence on the initial language of the population.
Thus, the lower the education level, the larger the number of initial Galician-speakers.

• The main conclusion that may be drawn regarding place of residence is that the larger
the municipality, the smaller the number of initial Galician-speakers. Another significant
result is that the larger the municipality, the higher the number of initial bilingual persons.

Gráfico 5. Lengua habitual = Graph 5. Habitual language
Siempre en Castellano = Always in Spanish
Más castellano que gallego = More Spanish than Galician
Más gallego que castellano = More Galician than Spanish
Siempre en gallego = Always in Galician

In terms of the habitual language, the following main conclusions may be drawn, many
closely related to those regarding initial language:
• In terms of age group, some results coincide with those for initial language. The younger
the individuals, the less Galician is used as the usual language, although there has been
a clear decrease in the number of monolingual Spanish-speakers.
• By provinces, Ourense has the highest percentage of habitual monolingual Galicianspeakers, while, at the opposite extreme, Pontevedra is the province with most bilinguals
who are habitual Galicia-speakers.

31

• In terms of the size of the municipality, as occurs in the case of initial language, the
smaller the municipality, the higher the percentage of habitual Galician speakers. In
contrast, the number of habitual Castilian-speakers and bilinguals is higher in the larger
municipalities.
• As regards place of residence, it may be concluded that the presence of Galician as the
habitual language is greater in rural areas, while in urban areas Castilian is more present
than Galician. The percentage of habitual bilingual speakers is also substantially higher
in urban areas.
• As regards the educational level of the interviewees, as in the case of initial language,
Galician was associated with lower levels of education.
• In terms of income, the lowest income level (less than 1,000 euros per month per
household) included a larger number of habitual Galician speakers, whereas the higher
the income bracket, the higher the percentage of habitual Castilian and bilingual
speakers.

Lastly, the final conclusions that may be drawn from the report on the situation of the
Galician language in society (produced by the Galician Language Observatory in 2007 for
the Xunta de Galicia (Galician Government) are as follows:
•

Galician is generally the highest-percentage habitual and first language spoken by
older people with lower education, resident in rural areas and in smaller municipalities
and with lower income levels.

•

In terms of self-perceived linguistic skills, the best results are for Castilian, mainly in
reading and writing.

•

In connection with the previous point, it must be mentioned that a slight improvement
was observed in the youngest generations who had already had the opportunity to
study Galician at school. Therefore, the influence of education was positive for the
Galician language, although not as much as desired because young people continue to
be more proficient in Castilian. Also, in spite of the recognised importance of teaching
for the Galician language, it is true that schools often have a de-Galicianising effect on
Galician-speaking children.

•

The results by age reveal a slight recovery of Galician among young people, i.e.
individuals aged between 15 and 24. In contrast, the sharpest decreases in the use of
Galician occurred in the 35-44 and 45-54 age groups.

•

Given the importance of transmission for the language, the results are clearly
unfavourable for Galician in all the variables, contrasting sharply with the situation of
Castilian. In most of the areas analysed, Galician is spoken more the higher the degree
of familiarity between the actors.

1.3.3. VALENCIAN

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the socio-linguistic studies carried out on the Autonomous
Community of Valencia were not general studies but rather focused on specific areas or
populations. The studies were carried out in cities and towns with the largest populations:
Valencia, Alicante and towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants. A survey was also carried
out on the European population resident in the Community of Valencia. All the
sociolinguistic studies may be consulted on the following web page:
http://www.edu.gva.es/polin/val/sies/sies_fonum.htm

In previous reports, the Committee of Experts requested a detailed map of the linguistic
zones in the Community of Valencia and an explanation of the criteria used to determine
these zones.

The Valencian-speaking and Castilian-speaking zones were defined by the Valencian
Parliament (Cortes Valencianas) in Articles 35 and 36 of Law 4/1983, of 23 November, on
the Use and Teaching of Valencian.

The municipalities in each language zone were included using the map and list of
population centres developed by the Institute of Valencian Philology of the Literary
University of Valencia and the University of Alicante.

34

The remaining population in the Castilian-speaking municipalities, in accordance with the
criterion established in Article 36 of the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian,
represents around 14% of the total population of the Community of Valencia. These are
data from the 2007 population census. The Valencian Statistics Institute publishes the
population data for the Community of Valencia by provinces, districts and municipalities.
There is no reference to population taking into account the linguistic zones. The population
figures shown in the following table were obtained from 2007 population records. The
figures referring to the Castilian-speaking zones include the populations of municipalities
declared as such in Article 36 of the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian.

Valencian is an optional subject at schools in municipalities in the zone where Castilian is
the main language. Parents and legal tutors of students in non-university education may
ask to be exempted from studying Valencian.

In 2006 and during the first half of 2007, the Valencian Government body responsible for
language policy was the Autonomous Community Secretariat for Culture and Language
Policy of the Department of Culture, Education and Sports.

Through Regional Government Decree 92/2007, of 6 July, which establishes the basic
organic structure of the Presidency and the different Ministries of the Valencian
Government, responsibilities for language policy were assumed by the following institution:
-

Regional Ministry of Education (Consellería de Educación)
Autonomous Community Secretariat for Education
Department of Language Policy
Av. Campanar, 32
46015 Valencia

35

The Valencian Language Academy (Academia Valenciana de la Lengua - AVL) is the
Valencian Government institution responsible for language regulations governing the
Valencian language (Article 41 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia):
-

Valencian Academy of Language (Academia Valenciana de la Lengua)
Monasterio de Sant Miquel del Reis
Av. Constitució, 284
46019 Valencia

Article 3 of Law 7/1998, of 16 September, on the Creation of the Valencian Language
Academy, establishes the functions of the institution, consisting in developing linguistic
regulations and monitoring the use of Valencian. Regarding the latter function, Article 7 d)
bestows upon the AVL the responsibility for "monitoring the normal use of Valencian and
defending its denomination and entity".

In exercising the function of “monitoring the normal use of Valencian and defending its
denomination and entity”, the Academy carries out specific initiatives to promote the use of
Valencian, in line with the spirit of the preamble to the Law that is firmly committed “to
promoting the use of Valencian at very different levels”. It should be noted that the content
of the preamble, as provided by Article 4, “must inspire the actions of the Academy”.

Two groups of actions may be differentiated: actions carried out directly by the Academy,
including initiatives directly involving academics and staff working for the Institution; and
actions promoted indirectly through subsidies.

1.3.4. BASQUE
1.3.4.1. BASQUE IN THE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY
According to Article 6 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, “Euskera
[Basque], the language of the Basque Country, will have, like Spanish, the nature of official
language in Euskadi.
The socio-linguistic situation of the Basque Country is reflected in the so-called SocioLinguistic Map or Survey, which presents an overview of the situation of Euskera or the
36

Basque language in the Autonomous Community. The Map is based on data from the
census and population records of the region, which include a series of questions on the
language. The Map provides information on the situation and evolution of the Basque
language in the Autonomous Community in the total population over 5 years of age.
The following criteria were used to define the different speakers in the Basque Country:
•

Bilingual: person who understands and can easily express him/herself in Basque

•

Passive bilingual: person who understands but has difficulty expressing him/herself
in Basque

•

Erdaldun monolingual (Spanish-speaking and French-speaking): person who does
not understand and cannot express him/herself in Basque.

The Fourth Sociolinguistic Survey, published by the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy in
2009, is based on data gathered in the 2006 Population and Housing Statistics, and
covers the whole population of the Basque Autonomous Community.
The Survey provides a broad overview of the evolution of Basque in the Basque
Autonomous Community: trends in knowledge of the language over the past 25 years, in
Basque as the first language over the past 20 years, and in the use of Basque in the family
environment over the past 15 years.
The reported data and trends refer mainly to levels in the Basque Autonomous
Community, the territories of Álava, Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa, the three capitals and the
four socio-linguistic zones.
According to data for 2006, 37.5% of the population aged 5 and over is bilingual, 17.3%
are passive bilinguals, and 45.2% are Spanish-speaking monolinguals. The number of
bilinguals in the Autonomous Community is growing continuously.

The total bilingual population currently stands at 755,640 persons, almost 325,000 persons
more (324,504) than in 1981. In 1981, the population of the Autonomous Community was
distributed as follows: bilinguals, 22% (431,136 persons), passive bilinguals, 12% (240,426
persons) and Spanish-speaking monolinguals, 66% (1,297,476 persons).
It is interesting to note that the number of bilinguals has increased in a period in which the
total population has declined by 12,470 persons (0.6%).
Another noteworthy demographic indicator is the increase in the foreign immigrant
population, which has multiplied six-fold in the last decade, increasing from a total for the
Basque Autonomous Community in 1998 of 15,000 to approximately 100,000 in 2007.
Overall, foreign immigrants still account for a small percentage of the total population
(4.6%), although there are large concentrations of foreign immigrants in some age
brackets (20-40), accounting for approximately 10% of persons in that age group.
In terms of the mother tongue of immigrants, since almost half (around 47,000 persons in
2007) were from South America, most of this population are Spanish-speakers.
A significant change has also taken place in the different territories over the last 25 years.
In Guipúzcoa, the percentage of bilinguals is now 13 points higher than in 1981 (40%), in
Vizcaya it is 16 points higher (15% in 1981) and in Álava 21 points higher (4% in 1981).
In terms of the territorial capitals, Vitoria-Gasteiz follows the trend in Álava. It is important
to bear in mind that most of the population in Álava live in the provincial capital (217,596
inhabitants, 75% of the total population) and also most of the bilingual population (53,359
bilinguals, 74% of bilinguals in Álava). Therefore, according to data for 2006, 24% of
Vitoria-Gasteiz’s inhabitants are bilingual. In terms of their evolution, in 1981 only 3.5% of
Vitoria’s citizens were bilingual. Bilbao has also undergone a marked change in the last
twenty-five years, because in 1981 only 6% of the city’s residents were bilingual (24% in
2006). Lastly, Donostia-San Sebastián is the provincial capital with the highest percentage
of bilinguals (41%), having doubled in recent years (21% in 1981).
By age groups, young people account for the highest percentage of bilinguals. At present,
62% of persons aged under 30 are bilingual, i.e. 43% more than in 1981 (19% of bilinguals
in the under 30 age group). The percentage is even higher among young people aged
under 15, who account for 75% of the population, since 20% of this age group were
39

bilingual in 1981. In any case, the demographic weight of young people in the total
population is lower than it was twenty-five years ago; hence, the increase in the number of
bilinguals in the younger age brackets does not have a direct influence, in percentage
terms, on the percentage of bilinguals in the total population.

Most of the bilingual population are original Basque-speakers. The majority (59%) of
young bilinguals aged under 35 have learned Basque outside their homes, i.e. at school or
in the euskaltegi (Basque language schools for adults) and are therefore neo-Basquespeakers. In 1986, neo-Basque-speakers represented only 22.1% of bilinguals aged under
35.

By socio-linguistic zones, 65% of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community
currently live in municipalities located in Sociolinguistic Area 2, where bilinguals represent
between 20% and 49% of the total population.

Most bilinguals (51% of the bilingual population) also live in municipalities in Sociolinguistic
Area 2, compared with only 32.8% twenty-five years ago.

At present, only 9% of bilinguals live in municipalities within Sociolinguistic Area 4, where
over 80% of the population is bilingual, compared with 15.4% twenty-five years ago.

The use of Basque in the family has hardly changed in the last fifteen years. 21.4% of the
population in the Basque Autonomous Community use Basque as much as or more than
Spanish. There have been few changes in this respect in the last fifteen years, with no
increase in use of Basque within the family, although more people are making general use
of the language. The use of Basque has increased in official circles but not in the family. In
spite of this, Basque is used as much as or more than Spanish more in the family than in
general spheres: 21.4% of the population use Basque in the family and 18.6% in society in
general. Today, bilinguals do not use Basque at home as much as bilinguals did fifteen
years ago and consequently the use of the language in the family has not increased.

In percentage terms, Basque is now used more at home by young people, although it is
true that this strong growth is the result of sharp increase in the number of young
bilinguals.

The family language of bilinguals is directly determined by the sociolinguistic area and the
first language of other members of the family.

Consequently, 89% of bilinguals whose first language is Spanish use this language in the
family (only 11% use Basque in the family). In contrast, only 14% of bilinguals whose first
language is Basque use Spanish in the family (86% use Basque in the family). The more
bilingual the sociolinguistic area, the greater the use of Basque as the family language
among bilinguals, and vice-versa.

1.3.4.2 BASQUE IN THE ‘FORAL’ COMMUNITY OF NAVARRE

Basque (vascuence o euskera) in Navarre is encompassed within the general framework
of Autonomous Communities with their own languages.
44

Article 9.1 of Organic Law 13/1982, of 10 August, on the Integration and Improvement of
the ‘Foral’ System of Navarre states that Castilian shall be the official language of Navarre,
and Article 9.2 of the same law states that Basque shall also have the status of official
language in the Basque-speaking areas of Navarre, and also that a special Act (‘Foral’ or
regional law) shall determine those areas, shall regulate the official use of Basque and,
within the framework of general state legislation, shall organise the teaching of this
language.

Thus, the law in Navarre, in contrast to the Statutes of other Autonomous Communities,
limits the status of Basque as an official language to part of the territory, in response to the
social reality and the historical and cultural importance that this language has had in these
areas.

Having established the limits of the official status of the Basque language in the Law on
the Integration and Improvement of the ‘Foral’ system, in 1986 the Navarre Parliament
approved ‘Foral’ Law 18/1986, on the Basque language, which aims to regulate the normal
and official use of Basque in social spheres, as well as in education and one of its key
objectives is to: “Guarantee the use and teaching of the Basque language in accordance
with the principals of voluntary and gradual incorporation and respect, and the
sociolinguistic situation of Navarre.”

‘Foral’ Law on Basque protects the rights of all persons in Navarre to know and use
Spanish and Basque, establishing Spanish as the official language of Navarre and the coofficial status of both languages in the Basque-speaking zone, in accordance with terms
established in Article 9 of Organic Law 13/1982, of 10 August, on the Integration and
Improvement of the ‘Foral’ System (LORAFNA).
The most noteworthy characteristic of the ‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language is the
zoning, consisting of the division of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre into three zones
according to the language used by the population in each zone: the Basque-speaking
zone in the north of the territory; the mixed zone or central part, including the capital
Pamplona; and the non-Basque-speaking zone in the centre and south of the ‘Foral’
Community.
45

The Basque-speaking zone is formed by the following municipalities: Abaurrea Alta,
Abaurrea Baja, Alsasua, Anué, Araiz, Aranaz, Arano, Araqull Arbizu, Areso, Aria, Arive,
Arruazu Bacáicoa, Basaburúa Mayor, Baztán Bertizarana, Betelu, Burguete, Ciordia
Donamaria, Echalar, Echarri Aranaz Elgorriaga, Erasun, Ergoyena, Erro, Esteribar,
Ezcurra, Garayoa, Garralda Goizueta, Huarte Araquil, Imoz, Irañeta, Ituren, Iturmendi,
Labayen, Lacunza. Lanz, Larráun, Leiza, Lesaca, Oiz Olazagutia, Orbaiceta, Orbara,
Roncesvalles, Saldías, Santesteban, Sumbilla Ulzama, Urdax, Urdiáin, Urroz de
Santesteban, Valcarlos, Vera de Bidasoa Villanueva, Yanci, Zubieta and Zugarramurdi.
The mixed zone is formed by the following municipalities: Abárzuza, Ansoáin, Aoiz, Arce,
Atez, Barañáin Burgui, Burlada, Ciriza, Cizur, Echarri Echauri, Egüés, Ezcároz, Esparza,
Estella, Ezcabarte, Garde, Goñi, Güesa, Guesálaz, Huarte, Isaba, Iza, Izalzu Jaurrieta,
Juslapeña, Lezáun, Lizoáin Ochagavia, Odieta, Oláibar, Olza, Ollo Oronz, Oroz Betelu,
Pamplona, Puente la Reina, Roncal, Salinas de Oro, Sarriés, Urzainqui, Uztárroz,
Vidángoz, Vidaurreta, Villava, Yerri and Zabalza.
The non-Basque-speaking zone is formed by the remaining municipalities.
The abovementioned ‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language regulates the actions to be
carried out in relation to the normal and official use of Basque (Article I), teaching (Article
II) and social media (Article III). The Navarre Government has been acting in each
linguistic zone as established in the aforementioned Law.
In terms of the normal and official use of Basque, the Law was implemented by ‘Foral’
Decree 29/2003, of 10 February, regulating the use of Basque in the Public
Administrations of Navarre.

The Law regulates the Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre), formed by:
- The Board of Management and the Managing Director.

This Law also regulates the Navarre Basque Language Council (Euskeraren Nafar
Kontseilua), which has the following functions:
a) Provide information on general plans and draft regulations relating to linguistic
normalisation, prior to their approval.
b) Give its opinion on issues that are presented to it by the Government on linguistic
46

planning and normalisation.
c) Present proposals to the Government in relation to the use and promotion of the
Basque language.
d) Any other function attributed to it specifically by regulations currently in force.

Moreover, Article 5.3 of ‘Foral’ Law 18/1986, of 15 December, on the Basque Language,
states that the Navarre Government is obliged to prepare periodic “studies on the
sociolinguistic situation of the Basque language, which it shall present to the Basque
Parliament”.

The most recent study, entitled “The situation of Basque in the ‘Foral’

Distribución de la población por zonas

Community of Navarre. A sociolinguistic study. 2008” was prepared by
Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre); the study
population comprised persons aged over 15, representing 85.3% of the
population.

Translation of text in map:

Zona mixta = Mixed area
Zona no Vascofona = Non-Basque-speaking area

It should be highlighted that 54.9% of the study population live in the mixed area, a total of
276,647 persons aged 15 and older, followed by the non-Basque-speaking area, which
accounted for 35.4% of the total population (178,524), and the Basque-speaking area,
where Basque is a co-official language, representing 9.7% of the population in the study
area (48,791).

The study sought to analyse the situation of Basque in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre
from a quantitative standpoint. The main objective was to define the linguistic proficiency
of people in Navarre in the knowledge and use of Basque.

To achieve this goal, the main aspects regarding knowledge of a language were analysed:
understanding, speaking, reading and writing. The population of Navarre was then
47

distributed according to oral proficiency in Basque, distinguishing between euskaldunes
(Basque-speakers), quasi-Basque-speakers and Spanish-speakers.

The data show that in the Basque-speaking area, 63.7% and 57.6% of people understand
and speak Basque, respectively, but fewer, 44% and 38.4%, respectively, can read and
write the language.

It may therefore be deduced that the majority of the population in the Basque-speaking
area has a more innate command of language (understanding and speaking) but fewer are
proficient in more literary skills (reading and writing).

In the mixed area, 11.4% of the interviewed population understand Basque, and around
9% command the other aspects defining linguistic proficiency.

In the non-Basque-speaking area, the percentage of the population that understood
Basque is lower at 4.5%, while around 3% command the other linguistic skills.

Based on the analysis of the level of knowledge of Basque, it may be assumed that
different relations with the language in Navarre exist. 11.9% of the population aged over
15 and resident in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre speak Basque or are bilingual; i.e.
they speak Basque and Spanish well or fairly well. Additionally, 6.2% of the population
state that they do not speak Basque well, while the remaining 81.9% are Spanish
speakers, i.e. they do not speak Basque.

account for only 9.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Spanish-speakers account for 83.5% in the
mixed area and 92.5% in the non-Basque-speaking area.

As regards the language used most often as a habitual means of communication by the
Navarre population, 5.2% of the population use Basque in their habitual communications
and 94.1% use Spanish.

Most of the persons interviewed who use Basque more to communicate habitually are
concentrated in the Basque-speaking area, compared with less than 3% in the mixed area
and the non-Basque-speaking area.
As regards the mother tongue of Navarre citizens, the graph shows that Basque is the first
language of 7.3% of the population and Spanish or another language is the first language
of 92.7%. Basque is the mother language of 52.8% of the Basque-speakers interviewed.

These percentages vary from area to area, as follows: in the Basque-speaking area,
Basque is the mother language of 49.6% of the persons interviewed and 50% have
Spanish as their mother tongue. In the mixed and non-Basque-speaking areas, a large
majority of the population interviewed stated that Spanish is their first language (96.4%
and 98.6%, respectively), while fewer than 4% stated that Basque is their first language.

1.3.5 OCCITAN OR ARANESE

50

In the Aran Valley (Era Val d’Aran), located in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia,
the language spoken is Occitan, called Aranese in the aforementioned valley.
This language was declared an official language in Catalonia in the 2006 Statute of
Autonomy of Catalonia.
Sociolinguistic data are presented below on the knowledge of this language in terms of
understanding (entendre’l), speaking (parlar-lo), reading (llegir-lo) and writing (escriure’l).

Since this is the first official survey to gather sociolinguistic data on Occitan in the Aran
Valley, no historical data can be presented for comparison purposes.

The survey also examined the population’s knowledge of the new official status of this
language in all Catalonia and in the Aran Valley (Era Val d’Aran). The data show that most
of the population of Catalonia were unaware of this (no ho coneix) (56.9%), while in the
Aran Valley this circumstance was known by the majority (ho coneix), specifically 84.6%.

1.3.6. ASTURIAN/LEONESE

According to the historian Menéndez Pidal, Astur-Leonese is a language situated between
Galician-Portuguese and Castilian, and is linguistically encompassed within the Western
Iberian group of languages. It derives from the unusual evolution of Latin in the kingdoms
of Asturias and Leon.
52

The Astur-Leonese subgroup is subdivided into western, central and eastern AsturLeonese, and is also known as Asturian (as defined in the Statute of Autonomy of
Asturias), Leonese (as established in the Statute of Autonomy of Castille and Leon) and
Mirandese in Miranda do Douro (officially recognised by the Republic of Portugal).

Asturian is the language spoken in different municipalities of the Autonomous Community
of the Principality of Asturias, with the exception of the Galician-speaking western part of
the Community; Leonese is the language spoken in some municipalities in the provinces of
León and Zamora, in the Autonomous Community of Castille and Leon.

According to different sociolinguistic surveys carried out by the Government of the
Principality of Asturias, Asturian is spoken by around 250,000 people (one quarter of the
population of Asturias).

There are no official statistics on the number of Leonese speakers; the most favourable
estimates (Estudiu sociollingüísticu de Lleón. Identidá, conciencia d'usu y actitúes
llingüístiques de la población lleonesa) calculate the number of Leonese-speakers to be
50,000, in the provinces of León and Zamora. Other studies lower this figure to 25,000
speakers.

Certain controversy exists regarding Leonese due to lack of official regulations. Some
associations have proposed their own standard, different to existing linguistic regulations
(such as the one applicable in Asturias, regulated by the Academy of the Asturian
Language, or the Anstituto de la Lhéngua Mirandesa (Institute of the Mirandese
Language), applicable to Mirandese in Miranda do Douro), while other associations and
writers propose following the spelling rules established by the Academy of the Asturian
Language.

1.3.7

ARAGONESE

The most favourable studies estimate that Aragonese is currently spoken by around
10,000 persons in various parts of Aragon. It is spoken mainly in the north of the
Autonomous Community, in the districts of Jacetania, Alto Gállego, Sobrarbe and the
53

western part of Ribagorza, although it is also spoken, in somewhat Castilianised form, in
other districts in the north of Aragon.

1.3.8. PORTUGUESE

According to different relevant studies, in Spain Portuguese is traditionally spoken in the
municipalities of A Bouza and Alamedilla (Castilla y León), Valle del Jálama, Herrera de
Alcántara, Cedillo and the border region of Alcántara in Valencia and La Codosera and
Olivenza (Extremadura).

In the linguistic geography of Extremadura, the large border area has fostered the
appearance of different dialectal and spoken varieties strongly influenced by Portuguese,
as well as areas in which bilingualism was common until a few years ago.

RELEVANT POLITICAL, LEGISLATIVE AND PLANNING DEVELOPMENTS IN
THE LANGUAGES OF SPAIN

1.4.1 STATE ADMINISTRATION

A.

-

MINISTRY OF CULTURE

Law 11/2007, of 22 June, on reading, books and libraries.

The so-called “Law on Reading” establishes a legal framework to promote Spanish books,
which are considered to be books in Spanish or in any of the official languages in the
respective Autonomous Communities. Thus, the regulation reveals the “clear desire to
protect and protect the linguistic diversity of the Spanish State by recognising the different
official languages”.

-

Law 55/2007, of 28 December, on Cinema.

The Law on Cinema establishes the creation of a specific fund to support cinematography
in these languages. Each year, this Fund receives money from the General State Budget,
54

and these amounts are transferred integrally to the Autonomous Communities, which in
turn manage these funds in accordance with their responsibilities. The State’s contribution
to each Community is calculated by applying the principle of co-responsibility and is legally
articulated through agreements between the Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual
Arts (ICAA) and the body responsible for cinematography in each Community.

Order CUL/2834/2009, of 19 October, indicating the rules for application of Royal Decree
2062/2008, of 12 December, implementing Law 55/2007, of 28 December, on Cinema,
regarding the recognition of the cost of a film and the investment of the producer,
establishing the regulatory basis for state aid and the structure of the Administrative
register of Cinematographic and Audiovisual Companies, envisages the need for more
flexible requirements for access to supplementary aid to finance feature films, in the case
of films in which the original version is in any of the official languages other than Spanish
(Article 56 of the aforementioned Order), recognising that support for these films favours
the linguistic and cultural diversity of the audiovisual panorama in Spain.

Royal Decree 1671/2009, of 6 November, partially implementing Law 11/2007, of 22
June, on citizens’ electronic access to public services.

Article 6, section 5. (Contents and services of online offices)

“5. Electronic sites whose titleholder has authority over territories with co-official languages
shall provide for access to their contents and services in the corresponding languages.”

D) MINISTRY OF TERRITORIAL POLICY

Royal Decree 905/2007, of 6 July, established the Council of Official Languages in the
General State Administration as the collegiate body responsible for analysing, promoting
and providing technical coordination between the different General State Administration
departments in relation to the use of the official languages of the Autonomous
Communities.
Article 8 of the aforementioned Royal Decree set up the Bureau for Official Languages to
provide permanent assistance and support to the Council of Official Languages. The main
objectives of this Bureau are to study, promote, guide, plan and monitor the use of official
59

languages in both central services and the peripheral structure of the General State
Administration.
As provided in this article, the Bureau has the following specific functions:
a. Provide advice and guidance to the Council of Official Languages of the General State
Administration and carry out any delegated tasks to this effect, acting as its secretariat.
b. Draw up technical diagnostic studies and reports on the use of official languages in
Central Government and its public bodies, either under its own initiative or on request.
c. Act as a permanent body dedicated to the compilation, analysis and exchange of
quantitative and qualitative information available from different national and
international sources in relation to the use of official languages.
d. Monitor on an annual basis the levels of compliance in Central Government and its
public bodies regarding the use of official languages.
e. Promote, disseminate and distribute research projects, surveys, studies and
publications related with official languages.
f. Promote the development of translation and interpretation in order to achieve the
targets set, with the possibility of proposing agreements with autonomous regions that
have more than one official language.

During the period covered in this Third Report on compliance with the European Charter
on Regional and Minority Languages, the Council of Official Languages of the General
State Administration held different meetings that have resulted in the improvement of the
services offered, with respect to the use of Spanish regional languages, in the General
State Administration.

At its meeting on 28 January 2008, the Council of Official Languages in the General State
Administration made a positive evaluation of the degree of compliance with State
legislation relating to co-official languages, observing that significant progress that had
been made in both promoting plurilingualism and in guaranteeing the rights of citizens
residing in Autonomous Communities with co-official languages. The Bureau of Official
Languages in the General State Administration was asked to prepare a report to be
presented to the Council, in order to provide an updated diagnosis of the situation
regarding compliance with existing regulations. To this end, it was agreed that a
60

questionnaire would be prepared for presentation to the Government Delegations in the
Autonomous Communities with co-official languages in order to obtain information within
the scope of the General State Administration and, specifically, on the availability of
standardised forms, printed material, notices, road signs and publicity posters in the
different co-official languages, as well as on the ability of staff to meet citizens’ right to
communicate with State bodies based in their Autonomous Community in the respective
co-official language. The representative of the National Institute of Public Administration
expressed the institution’s commitment to broaden the offer of teaching in co-official
languages for General State Administration employees requiring such training, and to deal
with any requests for such teaching. It noted that during the 8th legislature, 19,154 civil
servants attended language training classes, representing 67,197 hours of teaching and a
total cost of 1.84 million euros. The Council agreed to increase training in co-official
languages for General State Administration employees.
The abovementioned 2008 Report, prepared by the Council of Official Languages in the
General State Administration, was presented at the meeting on 23 June 2009. The report
was compiled based on consultations with Government Delegations and Ministries and
other bodies concerned.

The report identified a series of significant improvements and advances made in 2008
regarding the use of official languages in the General State Administration and,
specifically, in the areas of legislation, language training of employees, printed material,
posters, notices and signs, and in relation to General State Administration web pages.
Noteworthy examples of best practices include actions carried out by the State Agency of
the Official State Gazette (BOE), the Directorate General for Traffic, Civil, Property and
Trade Registers, the National Institute of Public Administration, the State Tax
Administration Agency (AEAT) and Social Security administrative entities.

Specific reports were presented by the Directors of the National Institute of Public
Administration and the State Agency of the Official State Gazette, on their situation and
actions relating to co-official languages. The representatives of all the Ministerial
Departments present at the Council meeting also provided information on the degree of
compliance with Law 11/2007, of 22 June, on electronic access for citizens to public

61

services: namely, the degree to which ministerial departments’ web pages are available in
the different co-official languages as of 31 December 2009.

The Council agreed to adopt the recommendations formulated in the 2008 report
presented at the Bureau of Official Languages’ meeting. These recommendations may be
summarised as follows:
- Promote, broaden and improve co-official language training for General State
Administration employees.
- Ensure full accessibility in co-official languages for the web pages of all Ministries
and public organisations, and enforce the rights of citizens to use co-official
languages in their relations with the General State Administration through
electronic channels (Law 11/2007).
- Complete the process of translation into co-official languages of all printed
material and standardised forms used for central government services in
Autonomous Communities co-official languages.
- Compile from the Ministries the information required for the Bureau of Official

1.4.2 AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION

A. AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF CATALONIA

In recent years, many regulations presented by the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and
approved by the Catalan Parliament have, to differing extents, addressed the use of
Catalan or Occitan (Aranese). The most important regulations of this type indicated below:

-

2006

On 20 July 2006, the Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE - Official State Gazette) and the
Diario Oficial de la Generalitat de Cataluña (DOGC - Official Gazette of the Generalitat)
simultaneously published Organic Law 6/2006, of 19 July, reforming the Statute of
Autonomy of Catalonia (Estatuto de Autonomía de Cataluña - EAC). The statutory reform,
due to its general nature, entailed the replacement of all the language provisions contained
in the 1979 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia by new regulations. The 1979 Statute of
Autonomy of Catalonia established the system of two official languages and until its reform
constituted the basic legal framework in the process of normalisation of Catalan in different
sectors of society. The provisions on language contained in the 1979 Statute of Autonomy
of Catalonia (similar to other current statutes of autonomy) regulated the gradual
implementation of the linguistic system in Catalonia, initially regulated by Law 7/1983, of
18 April, for the linguistic normalisation of Catalan, and later replaced and broadened by
the system established in Law 1/1998, of 7 January, on Linguistic Policy. However,
experience gathered during this period has enabled the detection of various shortcomings
or gaps in the regulatory framework, which highlighted the importance of the need for
statutory reform in order to reformulate the bases of the linguistic system in place in
Catalonia.

The first change with respect to language issues in this statutory reform is the greater
length and complexity of the language provisions it contains when compared with the
language provisions to be found in the previous Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia
approved in 1979. Thus, while the latter contained two articles and an additional provision
devoted to language, the new 2006 Statute contains, either expressly or indirectly, some
twenty articles [5, 6, 11.2, 12, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 44.2, 50, 62.2, 65, 101.3, 102.1,
102.3, 102.4, 143, 146.3, 147, 151 and 155.2.b)], in addition to a reference in the
66

preamble. The increase in the scope of the articles on language and linguistic rights entails
a correlative increase in regulations because pre-existing language legislation, which
essentially means the Language Policy Act 1/1998, of 7 January, has been given statutory
status and also as a result of the introduction of new aspects such as the obligation to
know Catalan and the recognition of exclusive powers with respect to Catalonia’s own
language.

By way of summary, the most significant language features of the 2006 Statute of
Autonomy are as follows:
• Affording statutory status to the basic principles of pre-existing language legislation:
Articles 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 (regulating the principles of own language and official
status); Article 12 (referring to territories with historical, linguistic and cultural links with
Catalonia); Article 33 (regulating linguistic rights in dealings with public administration
bodies and state institutions); Article 34 (which deals with the linguistic rights of
consumers and users); Article 35 (which deals with language rights in the field of
education); and Article 50 (on the promotion and dissemination of Catalan).
• The inclusion of issues which are subject to statutory reserve and had not been included
in the 1979 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. These are aspects which are directly
connected with the reference made to the Statutes in Article 3.2 of the Spanish
Constitution, which previously either did not exist or had weaker regulatory bases. This
would apply to the following articles: Article 6.2 (obligation to know Catalan); Article 6.5
(official status of Aranese, the variant of Occitan, previously recognised by Law 16/1990,
of 13 July, on the special regime of the Aran Valley); Article 43 (authority in language
matters, previously established under Article 3.3 of the 1979 Statute of Autonomy of
Catalonia); and also certain provisions establishing the language system of two official
languages applicable to state institutions (Article 33 – in various sections – , 50.7, 101
and 192), in the light of the reinforcement of their grounds inherent in the dual nature of
the regulations in the State of Autonomy of Catalonia (as both an institutional regulation
in the Autonomous Community and as an organic Act of the State).
• The reinforcement of the language duties incumbent on the State’s general
administration services and on the Justice Administration and notaries and registrars,
together with the regulation of language rights vis-à-vis state-wide constitutional and
jurisdictional bodies in Articles 33, 37.1, 50.7, 101.3, 102.1 and 147.

67

• The regulation of the Catalan language skills required of personnel in the general
administration of the Spanish State, in the justice system, in notarial offices and in
registries within the terms established by law (Articles 33.3, 33.4, 102.1 and 147).
• The reference to Aranese, the variant of Occitan spoken in the Aran Valley, the
declaration of its official status throughout Catalonia (even though the Statute defers a
statement of the scope and content of this official status to future legislative provision)
and its clear connection to the language and reality of Occitan (Articles 6.5, 11.2, 36, 50
and 143.2).
• Affording statutory status to language conjunction in non-university education to prevent
language-based separation, while establishing the normal use of Catalan, the right to
receive an education in Catalan and the teaching of Catalan and Spanish (Article 35).
• The recognition of the right to language availability in establishments that are open to the
public within the terms established by law (Article 34).
• The recognition of Catalan sign language in Article 50.6.

According to Decree 568/2006, of 19 December, on the restructuring of the Department of
Education, adult training is the responsibility of the Directorate General for Vocational,
Artistic and Specialised Training, to which the Subdirectorate General for Adult Education
belongs. Catalan is the vehicular and teaching language in adult training centres and
classrooms supervised by the aforementioned Subdirectorate General; all teaching and
programmes are in Catalan, except Spanish and foreign language classes.

Following the publication of Decree 3/2006, of 17 January (DOGC no. 4554, of 19
January), amending Decree 152/2001, of 29 May, on the evaluation and certification of
proficiency in Catalan (DOGC no. 3406, of 11 June), the certification system employed by
the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy consists of five general linguistic proficiency certificates.
Thus, following the introduction of the aforementioned regulation, the Secretariat has
ceased to call tests for the obtainment of specific language proficiency certificates
(administrative language certificates, business language certificates, legal language
certificates and text correction skills). This Decree was introduced as a result of the
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy's desire to focus efforts on the assessment and certification
of general language knowledge, for which there is greatest demand and which, due to their
nature, are those that adapt best to the functions of the Secretariat, and to define the
assessment and accreditation of specialist language proficiency in bodies, institutions and
entities that habitually provide this type of training.
68

For example, universities will accredit specialist language proficiency and the ability to
correct university texts, and the Centre for Legal Studies and Specialised Training, an
autonomous body belonging to the Catalan Department of Justice, will accredit legal
language knowledge within the scope of the Judicial Authorities.

Decree 349/2006, of 5 September, regulating the activities of service companies and the
representation of consumers and users before the public administration in the application
and execution of penalty procedures, regulates the use of Catalan by such companies.

Order TRI/487/2006, of 18 October, guaranteeing information and protection of consumers
and users' rights in the process of implementation of digital terrestrial television (DTT),
establishes consumers’ right to receive all information in Catalan.

-

2007

Order VCP/13/2007, of 24 January, amending Order PRE/228/2004, of 21 June, on the
qualifications, diplomas and certificates equivalent to Catalan proficiency certificates
issued by the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy, updates the latter Order insofar as it
establishes a new equivalence with the intermediate Catalan certificate for students who
successfully complete compulsory secondary education (ESO) in Aragon, and also
removes two equivalences with the advanced Catalan certificate in the form of the
certificate for checking oral and written texts issued by the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy
and the post-graduate Catalan text correcting diploma issued by the Autonomous
University of Barcelona.

The Catalan Health Institute Act 8/2007, dated 30 July, states that personnel covered by
special health service statutes who wish to have the same status in the Catalan Health
Institute will be required to have sufficient knowledge of Catalan and Spanish.

As regards local government, Legislative Decree 2/2003, of 28 April, was approved in
2003. This is a reworking of the Municipal and Local Government Act of Catalonia and
includes the provisions of Act 1/1998 referred to above. This means that Catalan local
government legislation compels local councils in their personnel selection procedures to
require proof of both oral and written knowledge of Catalan and, in the case of local
69

entities in the Val d’Aran, of Aranese to the level required for the duties to be performed in
the post in question (Article 287.2).

Decree 142/2007, of 26 June lays down the principles of teaching in primary schools.
Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the aforementioned Decree regulate the goals of primary
education, Catalan as the core of the educational project, language immersion and
Occitan in the Aran Valley. In turn, Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Decree 143/2007 regulate the
objectives of compulsory secondary education, Catalan as the core of a multilingual
educational project and Occitan or Aranese in the Aran Valley.

Article 2 of the Catalan Broadcasting Corporation Act 11/2007, of 11 October, which
repealed Act 10/1983, of 30 May, setting up the public Catalan Radio and Television
Corporation and regulating the Generalitat’s radio and television broadcasting services,
establishes that one of the Corporation’s functions is to disseminate and promote the
Catalan language, while Article 22.3 states that the institutional language for providing
public audiovisual communication services by the Catalan Broadcasting Corporation is
Catalan.

As a further development of the duties of radio and television broadcasters with respect to
the normalisation and protection of Catalan language and culture and of Aranese as basic
principles of programming schedules in the broadcast media, and in the exercise of its
powers, the Catalan Audiovisual Council passed Decision 118/2004, of 17 November,
which contains its General Directive on the presence of Catalan language and culture and
Aranese in the audiovisual media (DOGC no. 4281, of 16 December). It has been
repealed and replaced by Decision 295/2007, of 19 December, which approved the
Catalan Audiovisual Council’s General Directive on the presence of Catalan language and
culture and Aranese in the audiovisual media.

2008

In the area of non-university education, Decree 181/2008, of 9 September, regulates the
organisation of second cycle nursery education, and Decree 142/2008, of 15 July,
regulates the organisation of Baccalaureate education. Both decrees establish that
Catalan, as the own language of Catalonia, must normally be used as the vehicular
language of teaching and learning and in the internal and external activities of the
70

educational community: written and oral activities by students and teachers, explanations
by teachers, text books and other teaching material, learning and assessment activities
and communications with families and students.

Catalan Parliamentary Law 6/2008, of 13 May, on the National Council of Culture and the
Arts, created an advisory Council of the Generalitat on cultural policy, subsidies or the
cooperation and promotion of artistic creation. Its preamble states as follows: “In areas
where language gives shape to cultural expression, the Council must take special care
with respect to culture that is expressed in Catalan and must seek to ensure preferential
relations with cultural actors in other Catalan-speaking territories.”
Resolution VCP/2951/2008, of 30 September, orders the publication of the partnership
agreement between the Generalitat and the Autonomous Community of the Balearic
Islands to implement an amendment to the Bylaws of the Ramón Llull Institute, the
consequent inclusion of the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands in this Institute
and its acceptance of the new bylaws. The Ramón Llull Foundation was created on 31
March 2008, with headquarters in Andorra, by the Generalitat through the Ramón Llull
Institute and the Government of Andorra, in order to intensify the study, promotion and
defence of the Catalan language and foster the projection of the Catalan language and
culture outside Catalonia. In this respect, it is important to remember that Catalan is the
official language of Andorra.

Order VCP/17/2008, of 14 January, as a second amendment to Order PRE/228/2004,
dated 21 June, on the qualifications, diplomas and certificates equivalent to the Catalan
knowledge certificates issued by the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy, as amended by Order
VCP/13/2007, of 24 January. The amendments include equivalences with certificates
issued by the Public Administration School of Catalonia, the Centre for Legal Studies and
Specialist Training and non-university formal education qualifications.
Decree 195/2008, of 7 October, which regulates aspects of the legal system applicable to
Spanish State civil servants employed by local authorities in Catalonia, implements skills
provided for in Article 136 of the Statute and regulates knowledge of Catalan in its Articles
15.2.j, 22.2, 26.1.f and 35.c.

On 11 June 2008, the Board of the Catalan Interuniversity Council agreed to make
providing evidence of adequate knowledge of Catalan into a requirement for teaching staff
71

at all universities in the Catalan university system. The level of knowledge that is required
and which must be demonstrated in teaching staff recruitment procedures is equivalent to
proficiency. Visiting professors, emeritus professors and unpaid lectures are exempt from
this requirement.

The Pompeu Fabra Awards were created by the Generalitat of Catalonia through Order
VCP/460/2008, of 28 October, in order to recognise and reward people, entities,
companies and organisations that have helped promote the use of Catalan in a range of
areas. Specifically, five award categories have been created: communication and new
technologies; in the socioeconomic field; for the protection and dissemination of the
Catalan language; for professional, scientific or civic careers; and for joining the Catalan
linguistic community.

In terms of the measures adopted (in accordance with Article 6 of the European Charter)
to disseminate the rights and obligations deriving from the application of the Charter, the
Catalan, Aranese (Occitan), Spanish and English versions of the aforementioned Charter,
with special mention of the articles ratified by the State of Spain, may be consulted on the
Generalitat’s

web

page

The abovementioned web page also contains previous reports on the application of the
Charter, the evaluation reports issued by the Committee of Experts, and the
recommendations of the Committee of Ministers.

The Secretariat of Linguistic Policy, the Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation and the
different departments of the Generalitat also report on the language rights deriving from
both the Charter and Catalan and Spanish legislation. Such activities include, for example,
the work of the Department of Justice of the Generalitat to widely distribute the Charter on
citizens’ language rights in courts.

Lastly, work seminars have been organised with public subsidies to promote the ECRML
(European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages) and its application in the field of
Justice, with a view to promoting the contents of the Charter and raising awareness of the
requirement to guarantee the rights contained therein.
The following noteworthy support measures and economic incentives have been applied
by the Generalitat to promote Catalan and Occitan (Aranese):

Call for funds to promote interpersonal uses of the Catalan language: The Secretariat of
Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government publishes annual calls for funds aimed at nonprofit entities to finance activities to support the social and interpersonal use of Catalan,
and also Occitan and Aranese in the Aran Valley. The following table shows the total
volume of funding granted during the years covered by the report:

2006

2007

2008

1,000,000€

1,100,100€

945,400€

Tax rebates: The tax rebate has been maintained for donations to foundations and
associations included in the census of non-profit bodies specialising in the promotion of
the Catalan language, in accordance with Article 1 of Law 21/2001, of 28 December, on
Fiscal and Administrative Measures, published on 31 December. The law sets the rebate
at 15% of the amounts donated, up to a maximum of 10% of the entire figure for the
Autonomous Community. This operation involves support to the numerous nongovernmental organisations whose objective is to defend the use of Catalan.

Promotion of Aranese in Aran: The Aranese General Council (Conselh Generau d’Aran), as
part of its duty in relation to linguistic standardisation, has promoted the creation of the
Department of Linguistics at the Institute of Aranese Studies, for the study, promotion and
standardisation of Aranese, and has created the Social Language Council, a body that
provides advice on and participates in language policies. It has also maintained policies to
support school books, adult courses and language introduction courses for immigrants,
and is preparing an on-line learning course, as well as actions to disseminate and promote
the language, such as the organisation of festivals or prizes.

B. AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY

The following regulations were approved in the period 2006/2009:
•

Linguistic criteria in recruitment: the Government Council, at its meeting on 28
February 2006, approved the linguistic requirements that had to be fulfilled when
formalising administrative contracts entered into by the Basque Government, its
regional bodies and public private law entities.

•

Decree 190/2006, of 3 October, regulating the local analogue television service (Official
Gazette of the Basque Country no. 202 – 26 October 2006). Article 22 of the
aforementioned decree establishes the linguistic criteria for the awarding of licences.
The first section states that contents offered by local television licensees will promote
the use of Basque as the preferred broadcasting language. For this purpose, when
granting licences the use of Basque above the required minimum will be valued
positively, and, in particular, contents broadcast entirely in Basque.

•

Basque Parliament Law 3/2007, of 20 April, creating the Basc Etxepare Euskal
Institutua (Basque Institute) (Official Gazette of the Basque Country no. 89 - 10 May
2007). The Etxepare Basque Institute is a private entity governed by private law with its
own legal status and belonging to the Basque Government Department of Culture. Its
aim is to disseminate and promote the Basque language and culture the world over,
therefore taking on the linguistic and cultural work previously carried out in the field by
different Basque Government authorities while working on new programmes and
activities compliant to its mission.

•

Decree 128/2007, of 31 August 2007, establishing the system governing the report
issuing procedure for the Department of Culture within the framework of the procedure
for elaborating general provisions (BOPV (Official Gazette of the Basque Country) no.
178 of 14 September 2007).

The Department of Culture is responsible for drafting the required reports on general
provisions proposed by the Basque Government. These reports must be issued within
74

a maximum of one month and their objective is to evaluate the influence that proposed
general provisions will have on the standardisation of the use of the Basque language,
and to analyse the compliance of these provisions with linguistic regulations.

Since the publication of Decree 128/2007, of 31 August, as at 31 December 2008, 187
reports had been issued in response to requests presented by the different
governmental departments.
•

Decree 176/2007, of 16 October 2007, of the Basque Language Advisory Board
(BOPV no. 204 - 23 October 2007). The Basque Language Advisory Board is the
consensus body envisaged in Article 29 of Law 10/1982, of 24 November, on the
standardisation of the use of the Basque language, established to study, channel and
coordinate the work and activities of the different public and private institutions involved
in the task of linguistic standardisation.

The Board was last reorganised in 2007 in order to renew and strengthen its structure,
by increasing the number of representatives from different sectors of society, in order
to respond to the challenges that Basque will have to tackle in the future.
•

Basque Language Plan of the Basque Government for the Fourth Planning Period
(2008-2012): In compliance with Decree 86/1997, the Government Council of 1 July
2008 approved the Basque Government’s Basque Language Plan for the Fourth
Planning Period (2008-2012). In this plan, special importance is attributed to the criteria
governing the use of official languages. The Plan includes the following new elements:
it is based on the use of the language (each worker communicates at least once in
Basque); a larger number of workers participate; the methodology changes and the
importance of the organisational structure are emphasized. In 2008, a communication
campaign was carried out in the different departments of the Basque Government and
in Autonomous Community entities to provide information on the Fourth Planning
Period.

•

Decree 123/2008, on language rights of consumers and users (BOPV no. 35 of 16 July
2008). Decree 123/2008 on language rights of consumers of users was approved in
July 2008, in order to guarantee the language rights of consumers and users. The
75

Decree affects around 5,600 companies from or based in the Basque Autonomous
Community (around 6% of companies in the Autonomous Community) and these
companies will have 4 years to adapt to this regulation, and will also receive subsidies
to do so. A Sello del Compromiso Linguistico (Commitment to Language Stamp) will
also be awarded to companies that comply with and request the aforementioned
stamp.
•

Decrees 64/2008 (BOPV no. 71 of 15 April 2008) and 48/2009 on the validation of
Basque language certificates (BOPV no. 51 of 13 March 2009). The Basque
Government approved the aforementioned decrees in 2008 and 2009 for the validation
of qualifications and certificates accrediting knowledge of Basque and their adaptation
to the Common European Framework of Reference for Language. Consequently, 34
Basque language certificates have been validated as equivalent to the 4 levels defined
in the European Language Framework (B1, B2, C1 and C2).

Many citizens will benefit from this approval process since both previous certificate
holders and persons who obtain such certificates hereinafter will not have to retake
examinations in order to accredit their level of knowledge in any of the fields in which
this is necessary. Therefore, all Basque language qualifications are now official in all
administrations in the Basque Autonomous Community. This is an essential step for
the recognition of the work carried out by the euskaltegis (Basque language schools for
adults) and the efforts of citizens who learn Basque as adults.
•

Decree 150/2008, of 29 July, creating ELEBIDE (Service to Guarantee the Language
Rights of Citizens) and establishing the consultations, suggestions and complaints
system (BOPV no. 154, Thursday 14 August 2008) ELEBIDE (Service to Guarantee
the Language Rights of Citizens), to provide citizens, whenever they request,
information and advice on the monitoring of those rights, and collaborate with the
different departments, organisations and entities concerned, in order to ensure the
effective protection of the aforementioned rights.

•

Decree 152/2008, of 29 July, regulating the process of language normalisation in the
Judicial Administration in the Basque Autonomous Community (BOPV no. 161 –
Tuesday 26 August 2008). The Decree aims to regulate the process of linguistic
76

normalisation in the Judicial Administration in the Basque Autonomous Community.
The implementation of this regulation was completed with the approval of a Plan to
normalise the use of Basque in the Judicial Administration in the Basque Country.
•

Decree 53/2009, of 3 March, regulating the Sello de Compromiso Lingüístico-Bikain
(Commitment to Language Seal) and the Language Management Quality Certificate.
(BOPV no. 35 of 16.03.09). The aforementioned Decree created the Sello de
Compromiso Lingüístico-Bikain (Commitment to Language Seal) and the Language
Management Quality Certificate (Bikain) to certify and recognise the degree of
normalisation of the use, presence and management of Basque in the socio-economic
sphere.

The Language Management Quality Certificate (Bikain) is a language management
quality evaluation and certification system open to public and private entities and
business units or official work centres operating in the Basque Autonomous
Community.
•

Decree 88/2009, of 21 April, on the authorisation of sworn translators and interpreters
(BOPV no. 81 of 4 May 2009). This Decree aims to regulate professional qualifications
for sworn translators or interpreters working from Basque to other languages and from
other languages to Basque, and to create a register of professionals authorised to work
in this profession. Certification can be obtained in four ways: successful completion of
the corresponding tests, the obtainment of a university degree in Translation and
Interpreting in compliance with specific requirements, the validation of a qualification
issued previously by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, or the accreditation of specific
professional experience.

•

Measures adopted (pursuant to Article 6 of the European Charter) to disseminate the
rights and obligations deriving from the implementation of the Charter:

The Vice-Ministry for Language Policy has included on its web page
(www.euskera.euskadi.net) the document of the Kingdom of Spain ratifying the European
Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. The document is available on its web page
in the section on international legal regulations.
77

•

Main lines of action in the period 2005-2009 of the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy.

The main lines of action of the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy are established in the
documented entitled “Future of Language Policy - Project 2005-2009” of the Vice-Ministry
for Language Policy, and the following:
a. The Basque Government and the Basque Administration must pursue even more
effectively their task of normalising Basque. For this purpose, it is necessary to
mainstream language policy and thus to regard it as transverse to all departments
within the Basque Government. Transversally in this sense means that every
Government department must allow for the language factor in its day-to-day
activities and in the design and development of its projects. The Vice-Ministry for
Language Policy (VPL) must endeavour to see that his happens. The VPL must
help other administrations to advance along this road.
b. Try to increase the commitment of political parties, trade unions and social and
economic operators to the normalisation of Basque. Offer to work with those
operators to enable them to adopt and transmit model attitudes to society.
c. Secure the involvement of the Castilian-speaking community both in the process of
normalisation of Basque and in efforts to act as a channel for information on the
world of Basque.
78

d. To bring about a shift from knowledge to use, increase the involvement of those
capable of using Basque, strengthening their link with the language and their selfesteem, promoting the priority use of Basque and creating nuclei where the use of
Basque pre-dominates.
e. Prepare and systematically transmit a unifying and attractive discourse concerning
Basque to society.
f. Under Basque Government guidance, strengthen language policy co-ordination and
co-operation between the public authorities through HAKOBA (Commission for the
Co-ordination of Public Authorities).
g. Strengthen social initiative bodies and act as a channel for their contributions,
always as a complement to the language policy devised by public authorities.
Although the design and development of language policy is the responsibility of the
public authorities, the contribution of social initiative bodies is important for
strengthening the public's support for the language.
h. Compact, expand and normalise the Basque cultural market so that a significant
part of the needs of consumers of culture can be satisfied in Basque. For this
purpose, special heed must be paid to the lines of work laid down in the Basque
Culture Plan.
i. Promote and protect, with reference to criteria of excellence, quality contributions
devised and circulated in Basque. Likewise, Basque must constitute a compulsory
across-the-board stage in the communication strategy of all research work
performed in any field, especially in research done by a university or by public or
para-public bodies. If the language is to develop, it is therefore essential for a close
link to be forged between Basque and high-level cultural and scientific production,
especially in the field of popularisation.
j. Strengthen strategies for the international dissemination of cultural products and
their creators (efficient communication policy, translation, promotion, etc.) and use
the resulting international influence to increase, within Basque society as well, the
prestige of Basque and of the culture expressed in Basque.
k. Examine possible ways of preventing normalised and street Basque from diverging
from each other, and devote special attention to informal language.
l. Without evading self-criticism and debate and with the flexibility required by social
processes, try to harmonise laws and decisions.
m. Taking as a subject for analysis the progress made in language policy and the
steps to be taken over the coming years, encourage reflection and debate,
79

redefining strategies, lines of work and priorities as and when necessary. Since
the General Plan for Promotion of the Use of Basque (EBPN) has been running
for six years, we are now at the right moment for such a debate. Reflection
should be as comprehensive as possible as regards topics for analysis and as
open as possible regarding participants. Besides the world of Basque, there
must inevitably also be room for the Castilian world in this initiative. Public
institutions, education, culture, the media, business, political parties, trade
unions, economic and social associations, Basque-related activity sectors... all
areas must be integrated in this debate. The chief purpose of this open debate
will be to discuss the past freely and dispassionately and decide on future lines
of work and priorities. The reflection process will be based mainly on
conferences, lectures, seminars, articles and reports etc. The purpose of the
debate will be to breathe fresh life into the dream by continuing to advance
along the path of Basque normalisation.
n. Promote a Basque-friendly political and social attitude and work towards a new
political and social agreement on the normalisation of Basque. Along this road
the watchwords will be flexibility as regards the pace for implementing
language policy and clarity as regards the basic principles of that policy: social
equality between the two languages must be achieved (because the current
situation is diglossic); since a bilingual society requires bilingual citizens, the
proper steps must now be taken to enable subsequent generations to
know

both languages; the Basque normalisation process must take place

without excesses, but it will have to be accepted that this cannot be done
without inconvenience; language policy must be moulded to the will and
decision of the individual, but, if choice is to be free, it is essential for social
equality between the languages to be achieved in advance; the subject of
rights is the individual, not the language, and because of this public authorities
must ensure that those who wish to live their lives in Basque can do so.
o. Tackle the immigration question from an effective and integrating viewpoint in
order to avoid, among other things, a worsening in our present diglossia. With
this objective in mind and in collaboration with the Directorate for Immigration
and immigrant associations, whatever studies and analyses necessary must be
performed to enable us to obtain a proper knowledge and description of the
phenomenon. Linguistic plans must be designed and developed to find ways of
attracting immigrants to Basque, using the network of Euskaltegis (Basque
80

language schools for adults) for this purpose in addition to the education
system.
p. Adult euskaldunización and literacy. As recognized in the General Plan for
Promotion of the Use of Basque, "adult literacy and euskaldunización,
together

with

regulated

education

in Basque, has constituted

the most

important initiative and movement for promotion of the use of Basque". The
adult literacy and euskaldunización system is therefore one of the keys to the
advance of Basque and the achievement of a balanced bilingual society. Given
all this and the report and proposals of the Basque Language Advisory Board
(EAB)

concerning

this

sector

(Bases

for

Greater

Effectiveness

and

Improvement of the Quality of Adult Literacy and Euskaldunización, VitoriaGasteiz 2003), education adapted to the needs of society and of pupils
(general education specially adapted to specific social needs) must be devised
in the field of adult literacy and euskaldunización (“Basquisation”). The learning
process must be made efficient by emphasising service quality and pupils'
results and stepping up the activity of public and State-aided euskaltegis.
q. Increase the presence of Basque in the media and promote the Basque media.
r. Promote the continuity of Basque in the family, promoting plans to strengthen
its use in relations between young people and to succeed in making Basque
the first language of children in newly formed families.
s. Promote systematic actions to increase the use of Basque in the socioeconomic field, organising the involvement and direct participation of the
following associations: chambers of commerce, business associations, trade
unions, vocational education and continuing training bodies and

Basque

Government departments connected with the labour market. Plans to increase
the business use of Basque should be promoted on the basis of a model plan
devised to match the
businesses

concerned.

typology
A

and

characteristics

likewise

be

of

the

adopted

for

systematically assessing and certifying the use of Basque in businesses
according

to

the

quality

parameters

currently

employed

by

private

organisations, creating a specific certificate for this purpose or inserting the
Basque variable into existing quality certificates.
t. Boost plans t o p r o m o t e the use of Basque by administrations. Since the
objective is to encourage use, measures must be adopted to make Basque not
only a service language but a normal work language in an increasing number
81

of administrative areas. When the time comes for the mid-term assessment of
the Third Planning Period, a special effort must be made to determine the
necessary corrections and adaptations to this criterion. Co-operation with all
government departments and communication with workers will similarly have to
be improved, and it will be necessary to ensure that every department
approves and implements its own use plan. The relationship with municipal
administrations regarding implementation of the EBPN (General Plan for
Promotion of the Use of Basque) will have to be strengthened, with the aim
of promoting the use plans of those administrations. The task of setting and,
when appropriate, redefining the criteria resulting from the legal framework
(laws and decrees) of use plans must be undertaken.
u. Devote special attention to developing measures safeguarding the future of
Basque in areas with a high density of Basque-speakers. For this purpose,
euskaldunización of the various local relationship networks must be stepped
up. In doing so, it is highly important to aim at the youth sector because this is
the most dynamic population sector as regards creation and modification of
these natural networks. For the public administration, the primary emphasis
must be on the euskaldunización ( “ B a s q u i s a t i o n ” ) of medical, nursing
and paediatric staff, welfare assistants etc, in the health and social services.
For this to be possible, specific materials must be devised to facilitate the use
of Basque by the groups mentioned (support materials, working tools in
Basque, special-purpose teaching material, textbooks for the various dialects
and Euskera batua (standard Basque), etc.).
v. Since it is the responsibility of the public authorities to offer to citizens wishing to
live their lives in Basque the opportunity to do so and preserve their linguistic
rights, a service must be organised to protect the linguistic rights of citizens
who so request. This will safeguard the citizen and enlist the collaboration of
those responsible for areas where linguistic rights are being violated so that
they can remedy the matter. Organise the linguistic rights service, defining its
tasks

and

ensuring

complementarity

with

those

of

the

Ararteko

(Ombudsman’s Office) in order to avoid duplication.
w. Develop new resources, instruments and applications in Basque for new
information and communication technologies. Likewise, increase the presence
of Basque on the Internet and create digital contents. In this framework, work
will be done on, among other things, machine translation, the potential
82

applications of voice recognition and synthesis in Basque and the various
possibilities of creating and digitising cultural products in Basque (e.g. digitising
and circulating all texts produced in Basque up to the 20th century or all
research performed in Basque in universities etc). In any case, it is considered
absolutely necessary to analyse and record the current presence of Basque in
this field and the Basque-language resources already offered by these new
technologies, as well as to define the road to be followed in the future. It must be
remembered that, although this new information and communication technology
field is highly important for Basque, this is so not just because Basque,
inasmuch as Basque-speakers are now part of the globalisation/digitisation
society, has to adapt like all languages to this phenomenon, but also
because, as shown by analyses of Internet user profiles, young people who
know

Basque possess

the

ideal

characteristics

for

figuring

among

the

greatest consumers of these technologies.
x. Boost action to promote the use of Basque throughout its geographical area,
channelling co-operation with the institutions and associations of Iparralde and
Navarre.
y. Increase the presence of Basque beyond the boundaries of our territory, for
which purpose, among other actions, collaboration with Basque firms and
the university lectureship programme must be strengthened.
z. Boost the work of the Basque Language Advisory Board (EAB) regarding
both follow-up commissions and special commissions.
aa. Strengthen links with bodies that implement policies to promote minority
languages in Spain and internationally.
bb. An assessment must be performed of grants that have already been going
for some time (Basque-related activities, EBPN and the plans of public
administrations, new technology, the media, actions on behalf of France and
Navarre). An assessment and qualitative analysis of the administrative use of
Basque must also be performed from different viewpoints.
cc. In addition to giving continuity to the work of standardising proper names,
extension of the use of

Basque in

mapping,

road

signs

and

linguistic

landscape must be encouraged in accordance with quality criteria at all times.
dd. As regards awareness-raising, draw up specific projects for the parliamentary
term with the aim of sending out a message encouraging use of the language
by those who know Basque and supply the non-Basque-speaking world with
83

attractive-sounding information on the world of Basque.
ee. With the help of the Basque Language Academy and in co-operation with
certain

associations,

plan

and

promote

tasks

connected

with

the

standardisation, modernisation and normalisation of the Basque corpus, among
which special attention must be devoted to the draft reference corpus and to
terminological work.
ff. Encourage research designed to obtain information on sociolinguistic evolution.

Special mention must be made of the Euskera 21 Initiative promoted by the Vice-Ministry
for Language Policy and carried out in 2008.

On 25 October 2007, the Basque Language Advisory Board decided in a plenary meeting
to set up a special committee to lay down the “guidelines for language policy in the 21st
century”. Its members were appointed on 14 January 2008. Later, a work group drafted a
Principal Paper on the aforementioned guidelines in order to enrich and promote the
special committee’s work and to foster debate within society.

This triggered the public debate on language policy in April 2008. This has undoubtedly
been the broadest and most in-depth debate on language policy in terms of both the
number of participants and the variety of points of view contributed to the debate.
Discussions have always conducted in a calm and respectful but also demanding and
clear manner.

The web page Euskera 21 was created as an interactive communication tool to facilitate
citizens’ participation. The web page has received 41,671 visits and more than 600
contributions (11 long contributions and 594 short contributions). A further 6,000
comments on the debate have also been submitted on other web pages and 141 articles,
comments, interviews and other publications in the press.

All these contributions and the long, in-depth discussion within the Committee have
resulted in the document entitled “Towards a renewed agreement. Paper arising from the
open debate process”, adopted unanimously by the Basque Language Advisory Board.

The priority lines for a linguistic policy identified in the final report are as follows:
1. Guarantee knowledge and use of Basque in the new generations.
84

2. Foster, strengthen and extend the vital niches and functions in which Basque is the
habitual language, in order to guarantee intergenerational transmission of Basque and
to strengthen its character as a social reference.
3. Guarantee family transmission particularly ensuring that bilingual children that are
under thirty in 25 years time use Basque as a family language.
4. Strengthen the Basque-speaking community, extending and strengthening present and
virtual networks of Basque use.
5. Increase opportunities to use Basque in large cities, giving priority to Basque-speaking
families, youths and children.
6. Promote and lend prestige to passive bilingualism amongst adults (as a minimum
objective).
7. Promote cultural consumption in Basque, from an emancipating perspective for the
Basque cultural, production and creative industries.
8. Introduce immigrants to Basque and its universes in order to facilitate ample and
enriching integration, and to bring Basque into areas of use that are demographically
dynamic.
9. Make communication standards in Basque more flexible and develop them, as a
method of favouring the expressivity of new speakers. Move from formal correction as
a sole criterion to that of communicative and expressive quality.
10. Guarantee opportunities to use Basque on the road towards respect for linguistic rights,
beyond mere acknowledgement thereof.
11. Make Basque attractive and project it in a suitable manner: Basque contains multiple
universes and has room to take in the universes of those who reach out to Basque.
The Basque universe is more plural than the image we project would lead to believe
and we should make it even more plural, so that it reaches the same level of plurality
as society.
12. Lend prestige to the image of Basque, clearly publicising the cultural and
communication achievements, on the one hand and, on the other, expressing in
practice and integrating into discourse that Basque constitutes an essential component
of Basque social adhesion.
13. Use language technologies and, in general, information and communication
technologies to develop Basque, create contents on the Internet and properly use the
virtual communication network to favour normalisation of Basque and an increase in its
possibilities of use. In effect, Basque should use information and communication
technologies as a prerequisite to reach its full development as a language.
85

14. Nourish and constantly strengthen the most ample consensus on language policy
matters, following a renewed agreement that closely links revitalisation of Basque and
social cohesion.

The Vice-Ministry for Language Policy has published the results of this open debate
process in five documents that can be consulted on the following web page:

C. AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF THE BALEARIC ISLANDS

The following regulations referring to or concerning co-official languages have been
introduced since 2006 in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands:

Organic Law 1/2007, of 28 February, reforming the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic
Islands. (BOIB (Official Gazette of the Balearic Islands) of 1/3/2007). The new Statute
regulates Catalan in a similar way to the previous Statute, but in more detail in the sector
education.

Decree 114/2008, of 17 October, approving the Regulations governing the requirement of
knowledge of Catalan in selection procedures for access to civil servant posts and to
occupy posts that are announced within the Administration in the Autonomous Community
of the Balearic Islands (BOIB no. 150 of 17 October 2008).

Decree 24/2008, regulating the requirement for knowledge of Catalan in selection
procedures governing access and mobility, relating to statutory civil servant posts and to
occupy posts that are announced in the public health sector in the Autonomous
Community of the Balearic Islands.

Resolution of the Director General of the Health Service establishing the requirement for
knowledge of Catalan in selection and mobility procedures corresponding to certain
categories of statutory and employed staff in the Balearic Islands Health Service.

Resolution of the Director General of the Health Service of 29 December 2009 establishing
the requirement for knowledge of Catalan in selection and mobility procedures
86

corresponding to certain categories of statutory and employed staff in the Balearic Islands
Health Service.

Decree 61/2008, of 16 May, amending Decree 80/2004, of 10 September, on the
assessment and certification of knowledge of Catalan.

Decree 67/2008, of 6 June, regulating pre-school, primary and compulsory secondary
education in the Balearic Islands.

Decree 71/2008, of 27 June, establishing the pre-school curriculum in the Balearic Islands.

Decree 72/2008, of 27 June, establishing the primary education curriculum in the Balearic
Islands.

Decree 73/2008, of 27 June, establishing the compulsory secondary education curriculum
in the Balearic Islands.

Decree 82/2008, of 25 July, establishing the structure and curriculum of Baccalaureate
education in the Balearic Islands.

On 27 November 2008, the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture formalised the
Balearic Islands’ adhesion to the Protocol of collaboration in language policy signed on 16
March 2007 by the Autonomous Community Governments of Galicia, the Basque Country
and Catalonia to promote, in addition to Spanish, the other official languages of Spain.

Decree 128/2008, of 28 November, amending Decree 64/2002, of 3 May, which created
the Social Council of the Catalan Language. The composition of the Council has been
adapted to the new legal status of the Balearic Islands and the number of council
members has been increased to broaden the scope of the civil society.

Resolution of the Presidency Advisor, of 25 September 2008, ordering the publication of
the partnership agreement between the Generalitat and the Autonomous Community of
the Balearic Islands to implement the amendment to the Bylaws of the Ramón Llull
Institute, the subsequent inclusion of the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands
in this Institute and its acceptance of the new Bylaws.
87

In terms of the measures adopted to improve knowledge of the rights and obligations
deriving from the application of the European Charter, the Autonomous Community of the
Balearic Islands has disseminated the contents of the Charter by incorporating the Charter
on the Community’s official web page.

As regards the maintenance and development of relations, the following actions have been
carried out in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands in the areas covered by
the Charter amongst groups that use a regional or minority language and other groups in
the same State that speak a language used in an identical or similar way, as well as the
establishment of cultural relations with other groups in the State that use different
languages.

With the change of government in the Autonomous Community in 2007, the Directorate
General for Language Policy has promoted and re-established the Social Council of the
Catalan Language, which did not meet during the previous legislature.

In a plenary session on 18 June 2009, the Council definitively approved the first General
Language Normalisation Plan for the Balearic Islands.

This Council is the advisory and consultative body on linguistic matters in the Autonomous
Community of the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Directorate General for Language
Policy of the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture, and is formed by representatives
of parliamentary groups, trade unions, local councils, citizens’ entities and figures of
recognised prestige in the process of linguistic normalisation.

The abovementioned Plan aims to strengthen and consolidate the presence of Catalan,
the language proper to the Balearic Islands in all spheres of public, social, economic,
political and cultural life. The Plan is characterised by its integrational approach, since
Catalan is treated as an element of social integration, and its programmatic character.

After its approval by the Council in the plenary session, the document must be presented
to the Government of the Balearic Islands.

The Plan proposes the development of objectives and actions in the following nine areas:
88

1. Official uses
2. Education and training
3. Media and new technologies
4. Leisure and associationism
5. Socio-economic activities
6. Health and care institutions
7. Institutional relations
8. Cultural and artistic expressions
9. Informative and promotional campaigns.

On 16 April 2009, an agreement was signed with the Generalitat of Catalonia agreeing the
reciprocity of DTT (digital terrestrial television) broadcasts between IB3 and TV3. The
agreement will be valid for five years and the parties undertake to ensure that the
programmes and contents broadcast in DTT on the channels TV3 and IB3 may be
distributed and broadcast in other territories, also guaranteeing their distribution and
broadcasting within each territory itself. The agreement envisages that this reciprocity may
also be applied to a second channel in Catalonia or the Balearic Islands. The
Governments of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands undertake to respect the broadcasting
rights that the respective communities acquire or have acquired for their television
channels.

Both governments also undertook to study the feasibility of creating a joint Internet
television channel (IPTV) broadcasting the own productions of Catalonia and the Balearic
Islands, with a view to this becoming a space for jointly broadcasting the audiovisual
production of Catalan-speaking territories.

In order to establish a stable framework for cooperation between public television
companies in Catalan-speaking territories, both governments will promote the creation of
an association of public radio, television and other audiovisual media entities broadcasting
in Catalan to facilitate the production, dubbing, sale-purchase and exchange of audiovisual
products in Catalan and to promote the acquisition of rights to broadcast in Catalan for
external productions.

Under the agreement, both governments created a bilateral commission to share
audiovisual policies and actions to promote audiovisual production.
89

It is worthwhile highlighting that the Directorate General for Language Policy is striving to
adapt the levels of knowledge of Catalan to the parameters established in the Common
European Framework of Reference for Languages. To do so, it maintains regular contacts
with experts who have prepared the adaptation process for the Generalitat.

The Governments of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have offered to exchange
language technology programmes and instruments on numerous occasions. Since the
Generalitat has more resources available than the Government of the Balearic Islands, the
latter recently asked the former for access to the “Indexplà” web page, a computer
programme for assessing the degree of normalisation of Catalan in an organisation. The
Generalitat accepted its request.

The adoption of special measures to support regional or minority languages, designed to
promote equality among the speakers of these languages and the rest of the population,
taking into account their unique situations, will not be considered an act of discrimination
against speakers of more widely-spoken languages.

The most important measures to support and provide economic incentives to the
promotion of Catalan implemented by the Autonomous Government of the Balearic Islands
are as follows:

The following types of grants/aid have been announced:

1. Public notification of aid for actions to promote language and integrate new citizens.
2. Invitation to apply for two grants for onomastic training on placement at the University
of the Balearic Islands.
3. Invitation to apply for aid for newspapers written entirely in Catalan.
4. Public notification of aid to promote fixed signs and notices in Catalan in public
establishments.
5. Public notification of aid for actions to incorporate and normalise the Catalan language
in the areas of computer technology, office systems and information and
communication technologies.
6. Public notification of aid to promote visits by school groups to films in Catalan in 2009.
7. Public notification of aid to promote the screening of films in Catalan.
90

8. Public notification of aid for artists from Catalonia and the Balearic Islands to travel
abroad.
9. Public notification of aid for writers to travel outside their linguistic area.
10. Public invitation to apply for grants for innovative educational projects for the teaching
of Catalan as a foreign language and Catalan culture.
11. Public notification of aid for activities to promote and disseminate Catalan literature
abroad.
12. Public notification of aid for the translation of original literary and philosophical works in
Catalan.
13. Public notification of aid for the resident posts for translators of Catalan literature.

These grants are supplemented by others promoted by other entities, such as the Balearic
Islands councils.

Awareness-raising campaigns

-

Different awareness-raising campaigns have been carried out. The first, entitled Fes
del català la teva eina de feina (“Make Catalan your work tool”), in 2007, aimed at
Public Administration employees, in application of the provisions contained in Decree
100/1990 regulating the use of official languages in the Administration of the
Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands.

-

Another awareness-raising campaign launched jointly by the Directorate General for
Language Policy, the COFUC (Consortium for the Promotion of the Catalan Language
and Culture), the Island Council of Mallorca and Palma City Council to raise the public
awareness came under the general slogan Ara és la teva (Your time is now). The
campaign was launched in 2008 and different actions have been carried out: an initial
diversified publicity campaign: Ara és la teva, parla en català (“Your time is now, speak
in Catalan”); Ara és la teva, atén en català (“Your time is now, serve in Catalan”),
aimed at restaurants; Ara és la teva, estiu en català (“Your time is now, summer in
Catalan”); Ara és la teva, juga en català (“Your time is now, play in Catalan”), cinema
en català (“Film in Catalan”), teatre en català (“Theatre in Catalan”), etc. A commercial
signage campaign was launched recently using the same slogan, aimed at bars, cafés
and restaurants. This campaign uses comical figures that transmit a modern and close
image of the Catalan language. More information is available at www.araeslateva.cat.
91

-

The Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands adopted the linguistic and cultural
domain .Cat on its web page: www.illesbalears.cat.

Linguistic volunteering

The Directorate General for Language Policy collaborates in the campaign Amb tu, en
català (With you, in Catalan) launched by the Paraula Language Services Centre. This
campaign provides communication spots in Catalan and its core activity is linguistic
volunteering. Its launch could not have been more successful, with the participation of 400
couples, revealing the low number of Catalan-speaking couples in Palma.

Catalan courses

The Consortium for the Promotion of the Catalan Language and Culture (COFUC)
provides linguistic guidance to immigrants’ associations, the port authorities and other
collectives. It has published terminology for the health sector and sports federations.

One of the Consortium’s main actions consists in organising Catalan language courses for
adults, courses for non-Catalan-speakers, and courses for parents. These courses are
organised at their children’s schools.

Another alternative for learning Catalan are self-learning centres and points, belonging to
the COFUC, and located in different parts of the islands.

Linguistic integration plans

In 2009, the Parliament of the Balearic Islands approved a resolution to carry out a pilot
linguistic normalisation plan in Elvissa. In the last year, a group of persons of recognised
standing have been preparing this document, focusing, during the initial phase, on the
world of sports associations.

The aim of the presentation on Immigration and Linguistic Integration of the Social Council
of the Catalan Language is to prepare a linguistic and cultural integration plan for new
citizens in the Balearic Islands.
92

Language rights

The Directorate General for Language Policy receives complaints and contributes
information on guarantees and language rights to citizens through the Qssi system or its
web page.

D. AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF GALICIA

The main regulations introduced in the Autonomous Community of Galicia in the period
2006-2008 were the following:
•

Decree 124/2007, of 28 June, regulating the use and promotion of Galician in the
educational system.

•

Order of 16 July 2007 regulating official certificates accrediting levels of knowledge of
Galician (CELGA – Galician Language Certification System).

•

Legislative Decree 1/2008, of 13 March, approving the revised text of the Public
Service Law of Galicia, Article 35 of which incorporates new regulations on language
matters.

The measures adopted (in accordance with Article 6 of the Charter) to promote the rights
and obligations deriving from the application of the Charter are presented below.

The Secretariat General for Language Policy of the Galician Government (Xunta de
Galicia) includes legal information on the Galician language on its web page, including all
information relating to the Charter (ratification instrument, periodical reports of the Spanish
State, final reports issued by the Council of Europe). This information is available at:
http://www.xunta.es/linguagalega/lexislacion_0. The Secretariat General for Language
Policy also periodically publishes books and informative leaflets promoting the rights and
obligations deriving from the application of the Charter.

During the period covered in this report, measures were introduced to promote equality
between speakers of Galician and Spanish. These measures are not considered an act of
discrimination against Spanish-speakers.

93

E. AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF VALENCIA

The regulations introduced since 2006 in the Autonomous Community of Valencia referring
to or affecting co-official languages are indicated below.

In education matters, the Valencian Department of Education has changed the curricula of
Compulsory Secondary Education and Baccalaureate Education. As a result, new
regulations have been introduced on the curriculum for the Valencian language (language
and literature at the aforementioned levels), as well as for other subjects. The following
regulations have been introduced in this respect:
-

Regional Ministry of Education Decree 112/2007, of 20 July, establishing the
curriculum for Compulsory Secondary Education in the Autonomous Community of
Valencia (DOCV (Official Gazette of the Valencian Community) no. 5.562 of 24 July
2007).
https://www.docv.gva.es/portal/portal/2007/07/24/pdf/2007_9717.pdf

-

Regional Ministry of Education Decree 102/2008, of 11 July, establishing the
curriculum for Baccalaureate Education in the Autonomous Community of Valencia
(DOCV no. 5.806 of 15.07.2008).
https://www.docv.gva.es/portal/portal/2008/07/15/pdf/2008_8761.pdf

Language teaching provided at Official Language Schools has been adapted to basic
regulations governing language teaching, regulated in Ministry of Education and Science
Royal Decree 1629/2006, of 29 December. The following provisions have been adopted
governing the teaching of Valencian in schools in the Community of Valencia:
-

The Regional Ministry of Education has updated the regulation governing the qualifications
required by non-university teachers to teach in and from Valencian:
-

Order of 5 October 2009, regulating the Technical Language Training Plan in
languages of non-university teachers and the obtainment of the administrative
qualifications necessary for the vehicular use of languages at all levels of nonuniversity teaching (DOCV no. 6,132, of 28 October).
https://www.docv.gva.es/portal/portal/2009/10/28/pdf/2009_12156.pdf

The Regional Ministry of Education requires candidates for non-university teaching posts
to have knowledge of both official languages. This requirement is governed by the
regulation on access to non-university teaching departments. For example, the admission
programmes in 2009 for teachers, professors and department heads:

F. ‘FORAL’ COMMUNITY OF NAVARRE

The following regulations have been introduced since 2006 in the ‘Foral’ Community of
Navarre in relation to, or concerning, co-official languages:

A new specific regulation on Basque has been published, ‘Foral’ Decree 55/2009, of 15
June, regulating the consideration of knowledge of Basque of organic civil servants in the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and in bodies of the Autonomous Community of Navarre
(BON (Official Gazette of Navarre) no. 81, of 3 July). The Decree establishes the
provisions regulating the adaptation of existing scales of merit to the ‘Foral’ Decree and
expressly repeals Articles 21 and 23 of ‘Foral’ Decree 29/2003, of 10 February, regulating
the use of Basque in the Public Administrations of Navarre.

Mention may also be made of ‘Foral’ Law 11/2007, of 4 April, governing the
implementation of Electronic Government in the Administration of the ‘Foral’ Community of
Navarre (BON no. 48, of 18 April); Article 4.b) which recognises citizens’ right to use
Spanish and Basque in electronic procedures in the terms established in legislation
regulating the use of Basque.

96

Changes have also been introduced in vacancies for organic civil servants (regarding
knowledge of Basque), or determination of official names of local entities (e.g. DF 55/2006.
BON 106/2006).

The Navarre Government, through ‘Foral’ Decree 183/2007, of 10 September, created the
Autonomous Community body Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre)
(BON no. 118 of 21 September). The regulation on the statutes includes a section on the
Basque Language Council of Navarre (Euskeraren Nafar Kontseilua):

The Basque Language Council of Navarre (Euskeraren Nafar Kontseilua) is the
participative body of the Basque Language Institute of Navarre (Euskeraren Nafar
Institutua) and the body responsible for counselling and presenting proposals to the
Navarre Government on matters relating to the planning and promotion of the Basque
Language.

1. The following are members of the Council:
a) The Regional Minister of Education, as President of the Council.
b) The Managing Director of Euskeraren Nafar Institutua (Basque Language Institute
of Navarre), as Vice-President of the Council.
c) The Director of the Basque Language Advisory and Research Service.
d) The Managing Director of Occupational Training and Universities.
e) The Managing Director of Planning, Quality and Innovation.
f) The President of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language (Euskaltzaindia).
g) One member, proposed by each of the following institutions and entities:
-

Public University of Navarre.

-

University of Navarre.

-

Royal Academy of the Basque Language (Euskaltzaindia)

-

Society of Basque Studies (Eusko Ikaskuntza).

-

Navarre Federation of Municipalities and Councils.

-

Navarre Federation of Ikastolas.

-

Navarre Press Association.

h) Two members proposed by the cultural associations or social-initiative entities that
have included the promotion of the Basque language in their statutes.

Its most important functions are to:
97

a) Provide information on the general plans and regulatory projects relating to
linguistic normalisation, prior to their approval.
b) Give its opinion on issues raised by the Government on language planning and
normalisation.
c) Present proposals to the Government in relation to the use and promotion of
Basque.

‘Foral’ Decree 183/2007, of 10 September, created the Autonomous Community body
Euskeraren Nafar Institutua (Basque Language Institute of Navarre).

Subsequently, ‘Foral’ Decree 55/2008, of 26 May, modified ‘Foral’ Decree 183/2007, of 10
September, which created the Autonomous Community entity Euskeraren Nafar Institutua
(Basque Language Institute of Navarre) (ENAI/INAV).

More recently, ‘Foral’ Decree 107/2008, of 3 November, amended the Statutes of the
Autonomous Community body Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre),
approved by ‘Foral’ Decree’ 183/2007, of 10 September, creating the Autonomous
Community body Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre).

The Navarre Government Agreement of 14 April 2008 appointed the members of the
Basque Language Council of Navarre (Euskeraren Nafar Kontseilua).

‘Foral’ Decree 24/2007, of 19 March, establishing the primary education curriculum in the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre (BON of 23 May). Regarding the development of knowledge
of the natural, social and cultural environment, it establishes that the subject ‘Foral’
Community of Navarre is taught in the Second Cycle of Block 8; this consists in the study
of one of the Autonomous Community’s official languages under the title “Cultural diversity:
1. The Basque language.”.

Similarly, the Compulsory Secondary Education curriculum in Navarre establishes the
following:

‘Foral’ Decree 25/2007, of 19 March, establishing the Compulsory Secondary Education
curriculum in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre (BON of 25 May). The provisions contained
98

in this decree relating to social sciences, geography and history in the Second Year
include the Block 2 subject “Population and society”, and Basque is studied under the
subject title of “Unity in diversity: - The Basque language: Origin. Navarre dialects. Certain
Navarre toponyms and their meaning”.

Since the creation of Euskerabidea (Basque Language Institute of Navarre), the Navarre
Government and the Basque Government have collaborated in this area. As a result of this
collaboration, a Declaration of Intention was signed on 26 January 2009 between both
governments to promote and boost the heritage importance of Basque as a cultural link,
mutually adopting a series of commitments, including the following:
1.

Strengthen links to drive the promotion, research, planning and linguistic policy of the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and the Autonomous Community of the Basque
Country, in order to improve cooperation and inter-relationships in the area of the
linguistic normalisation of Basque.

2.

One priority objective of the joint actions carried out by virtue of the present
Declaration of Intentions shall be to promote technical cooperation links in the area of
linguistic policy that entail the exchange of information and knowledge, and
coordination of actions in the area of “euskaldunización” (Basquisation) and adult
literacy. All the foregoing in order to establish a basic and common curriculum for the
teaching of Basque to adults that complies with the provisions established in the
Common European Framework of Reference for Languages in order to establish
accreditations and qualifications that may be certified by both Administrations.

The collaboration that existed previously has intensified since the signing of the
aforementioned declaration.

Euskerabidea has initiated a round of contacts and visits with other institutions working in
the same or similar areas in their respective communities.

In this connection, in December 2008, Institute representatives visited the General
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Xunta. A work meeting was held with representatives
of the aforementioned Secretariat in which the work lines of each institution were
presented in order to learn about the situation of Galician and Basque in Navarre.

99

In October 2008, a work session was held with the representatives of the Basque
Language Office in Bayonne. Each institution was presented and future field of
collaboration were analysed.

The following measures to support and provide economic incentives to promote Basque
adopted by the Autonomous Government of Navarre may be highlighted:

Cultural publications on the Basque language published by the Navarre Government or
which receive support for their publication:

In Navarre there are two specific periodic publications on Basque, one scientific and the
other eminently informative:
-

Fontes, lingua vasconum. A four-monthly publication by the Prince of Viana Institute
(Regional Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Navarre Government) that first
appeared in 1969. Purpose: publish studies and documentation on the Basque
language.

-

Ze berri? Magazine disseminating and
promoting Basque in the mixed and nonBasque-speaking area. This quarterly
magazine reached its 60th edition this
year. In recent years, funding from the
Navarre Government has varied. In
principle, funding was granted under a collaboration agreement, later through an
invitation for aid in the media, as well as a campaign under the “Agreement between
the Navarre Government and certain Local Entities for the normalisation of the Basque
language at municipal level”; this agreement will be renewed in 2009.

This informative publication aims to provide information on Basque in an attractive and
friendly manner in order to reach the non-Basque-speaking public. Most of its contents
are published in Spanish and some in Basque. It is mainly distributed in households in
municipalities in the mixed area and is managed by the Services Association of Huarte
and Esteribar.

The publication’s budget has evolved as follows:

The Navarre Government also organises an annual aid programme for social media in
order to promote the use of Basque in all media (written press, radio, television and
Internet).

Finally, some language policy actions carried out by the Navarre Government are
supported by funds approved by the Navarre Parliament for Euskerabidea, as detailed in

SECOND PART: NON-OFFICIAL REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES

102

To report about the regional or minority languages considered in this second part of the
Report, attention is essentially and as far as possible paid to the objectives and principles
set out in article 7 of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, explicitly
referencing the pertinent objectives and principles for which data is available. Also
included for each language is a general introduction on the situation of same in its context.

2.1 EXTERIOR GALICIAN (EXTREMADURA, CASTILLA Y LEÓN AND ASTURIAS)

Exterior Galician is considered to be the Galician spoken in Spain outside the Autonomous
Community of Galicia, i.e., the Galician spoken in three municipalities of the Autonomous
Community of Extremadura, in various municipalities of the provinces of León and Zamora
in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León, and in the western fringe of the
Autonomous Community of the Principality of Asturias.

To report on this language the autonomous governments of Galicia (the Xunta),
Extremadura (Junta), Castilla y León (Junta) and the Principality of Asturias (Government)
were consulted (regional administration), along with the respective ministries (state
administration) and the Royal Galician Academy (institution in which exterior Galician
speakers are represented).

2.1.1. GALICIAN IN EXTREMADURA

INTRODUCTION.

Galician in Extremedura (also known as Fala – “speech”) is spoken in three localities in the
Gata Mountains in northwest Cáceres province. The three towns (Valverde do
Fresno/Valverde del Fresno, As Ellas/Eljas and San Martín de Trebello/San Martín de
Trevejo) count about 5,000 inhabitants in 251.71 km2 (6,000 inhabitants according to the
Junta of Extremadura, 4,500 according to the Xunta of Galicia or 4,617 according to the
Royal Galician Academy).

Transmitted orally from generation to generation, Fala is the language mode habitually
used for communication by the inhabitants of these three localities in northern
103

Extremadura, constituting an existing bilingual community in the Extremadura region. Its
inhabitants are able to express themselves fluently in both Castilian [Spanish] and Fala,
automatically and without effort, although when communicating among each other in or
outside of their places of origin their minds think in Fala, which they use to communicate.

According to the Royal Galician Academy, according to the 1999 study by Costas
González, the level of Galician use in Extremadura is very high in the family and social
context. However, an accelerated process of aging and depopulation is occurring,
especially in non-urban areas.

The subject of Fala’s origin is not without controversy. The May 1999 Congress on Fala
brought to light diverse opinions – for one major group it derives from Galician, for others
from Astur-Leonese, while for others it is a dialect of Portuguese.

Based on these scientific discrepancies regarding its origin the public authorities have
taken different stances on the language spoken those three locations in Cáceres. The
Junta of Extremadura holds that it is a language which derives, due to repopulation, from a
medieval Galician-Portuguese branch, though with later influences from León, Castile,
Extremadura and Portugal, asserting that Fala has significant linguistic differences
compared to to all these languages and dialects. This Autonomous Community affirms that
Fala speakers have a particularly strong sense of identity very far removed from
identification with other languages.

The Xunta of Galicia holds that in those Cáceres districts a linguistic variety is spoken,
which according to various academic sources derives from Galician and is called Fala; in
its report the Xunta nevertheless refers to it as “Galician in Extremadura”.
For its part, the Royal Galician Academy, which counts among its academics a
representative of Fala, defends the Galician nature of this language by stating that in those
three places in northern Extremadura what is used is a “falar também essencialmente
galego” [“speech also essentially Galician”], in the words of the Portuguese philologist Luís
F. Lindley Cintra (1959).

104

This report does not seek to take any position on this still open question and has opted to
use “Galician in Extremadura” because it is so designated in Council of Europe
documents, although the name Fala is also used indistinctly.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

The Junta of Extremadura recognises Fala as a native modality and has statutory powers
to promote the particular traits of the Extremaduran people, strengthen the Extremaduran
identity and foster culture and defend the right of Extremadurans to their particular cultural
traits; it declared Fala to be an Asset of Cultural Interest by Decree 45/2001 of 20 March
2001.

This language mode was given a major boost after the First Congress on Fala held in May
1999; the Congress’s echo in the press enhanced the inhabitants’ own awareness and
feelings about the real value of their language and that the rest of the region was
interested in the particularities of this part of Extremadura. Rural and research tourism also
increased considerably.

THE RESPECT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF EACH REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT EXISTING OR NEW ADMINISTRATIVE
DIVISIONS DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN OBSTACLE TO THE PROMOTION OF THE
REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGE IN QUESTION

In collaboration with the Autonomous Community of Galicia, the University of Extremadura
has maintained a Galician Studies Centre since 1999, the result of institutional cooperation
between the University of Extremadura and the Regional Ministry of Education and
University Planning of the Xunta of Galicia.

These relations resulted in a summer course held by the Universities of Extremadura and
Vigo in July 2007 in San Martín de Trevejo, with high student attendance.

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGAUGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM
105

According to the Junta of Extremadura, since late 2008 a project has been under way for a
Fala Museum in San Martín de Trevejo, approved by Resolution of the Junta of
Extramadura dated 21 November 2008.

The placement of bilingual street signs and information labels has also intensified in
collaboration with the local authorities and ADISGATA.

Lastly, a 25-minute documentary about Cáceres Galician was produced by Pasaca and
directed by Rubén Pardiñas. Its title was “A terceira póla” [The third pole].

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

According to the Junta of Extremadura, the Office of Cross-border Initiatives (in copublication with the Regional Publisher of Extremadura) has put out about a half-dozen
titles concerning Fala. Activities have also been undertaken such as the staging of a wellreceived theatre work on Fala.

On the other hand, the Royal Galician Academy indicates that there is no presence of Fala
in any media, not even those of the Autonomous Community itself, and that the presence
of the Galician language in the administration, if it exists, is incidental.

In the territories where exterior Galician is spoken (mainly in Asturias and León) there are
cultural associations, some of which are exclusively for defending that language. In
Extremadura, the Royal Academy highlights the Fala i Cultura Association.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

According to the Junta of Extremadura numerous educational actions are undertaken in
Fala’s area of influence, for both teachers and students, as well as summer courses,
attention to cultural associations whose aim is to preserve that linguistic heritage, signage
106

in Castilian and Fala, etc... Standing out among them is the project “A fala na escuela”
[Fala in school], whose basic goals were to:
a) Integrate Fala in the regulated education given in the three localities;
b) Disseminate Fala as a spoken and written language among young people of the three
municipalities. The active participation of youths residing in these places ensures
continuity;
c) Develop new tools, using new technologies and educative multimedia, to study Fala.
For its part the Royal Galician Academy argues that “Fala” receives no regulated school
attention.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

A Congress or Course was conducted by the universities of Extremadura and Vigo in July
2007 in San Martín de Trevejo, with a large number of students attending, most of them
from Galicia and the three localities in Extremadura.
The 1st Congress on Fala held in May 1999 was the first occasion in which the topics of
the origins and current situation could be debated. It no doubt served as an incentive for
the residents of the places themselves to verify the importance of its preservation.

THE PROMOTION OF APPROPRIATE TYPES OF TRANSNATIONAL EXCHANGES, IN
THE FIELDS COVERED BY THIS CHARTER, FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES USED IN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR FORM IN TWO OR MORE STATES
A summer course (inter-comarca border area course) was held in Valverde offered by the
University of Extremadura and conducted by the professors Eduardo Alvarado Corrales
and Francisco Sánchez Lomba, who sought to investigate the traces of its Portuguese
neighbours in Fala.

Regarding the other objectives and principles considered in article 7 of the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

107

2.1.2. GALICIAN IN CASTILLA Y LEÓN

INTRODUCTION

According to information provided by the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León, in
that Autonomous Community Galician is spoken in the western part of the provinces of
León and Zamora in a total of 24 town hall areas pertaining to the comarcas
[administrative regions] of El Bierzo (19) and Sanabria (5). Both El Bierzo, since 2001 the
only comarca legally constituted in the Autonomous Community, and Sanabria were
historically and culturally linked to Galicia and hence a linguistic attachment to Galicia still
persists – a linguistic trunk of which it is a part.

Although there are no demographic or socio-linguistic studies providing reliable information
on the exact number of Galician speakers in El Bierzo and Sanabria, it is estimated that in
the former there are about 30,000 Galician speakers (around 40 percent of the total
population), while in the latter thare are about 1,200. Regarding the speakers’ profile, the
most numerous group of Galician speakers are on the fringes of old age, especially people
more than 60 years old, for the majority of whom Galician is their mother tongue.

The Royal Galician Academy adds to the above that it must be kept in mind that in the
municipality of Ponferrada (61,829 inh.) there are some Galician-speaking areas (San
Pedro de Devesas and Fontesnovas); in the city of Ponferrada itself there is also an
undetermined number of Galician-speakers from regions of El Bierzo and also neospeakers mindful of the social recovery of Galician in León.

The Royal Galician Academy has noted that an accelerated process of aging and
depopulation is occurring, especially in non-urban areas. The depopulation is alarming in
the case of four council districts of Zamora: in 1981 the actual population was 2,031
inhabitants; on 1 January 2001 only 1,397 were registered. There has also been a strong
intergenerational decline in the use of Galician, especially in León.

The Royal Galician Academy conducted a survey between October and August 2004 of
470 people between 15 and 54 years old in the Galician-speaking territories that are the
subject of this report: Asturias, 217 respondents in the concejos [municipalities] of
Castropol, El Franco, Navia and Tapia; in León, 248, in Cacabelos, Ponferrada, Veiga de
108

Espiñaredo, Viladecais and Vilafranca; and in Zamora, 5, in Hermisende. From this as yet
unpublished study we can advance some overall figures for Asturias, León and Zamora.

Joining the answers “only Galician” and “more Galician (than Castilian)”, the percentage of
(spoken) use is extremely low:
a) in initial language, 8.2%;
b) in habitual language, 6.6%;
c) in family interactions, with father 7.3%, mother 7.7%, siblings 7.1%, sentimental
companion 5.6% and children 6. %;
b) in school: language that the respondent spoke with companions from primary 5.9%,
secondary 3.8%, primary teachers 4.8; secondary teachers 2%;
c) at work: habitual language 3.4%; with companions 4.3%; superiors 4.6%;
subordinates 3.6% and customers/clients 2.9%;
d) in other communication situations: with neighbours 3.6%, friends 5.4%, habitual
shopping language 2.5%, non-habitual shopping language 2.2%, in town hall offices
2%, with assigned doctor 1.5%, with specialist doctor 1.4%.

When we consider written usage, the percentages are even lower.

In exchange, regarding linguistic skills in Galician, the percentages are not so
discouraging, because joining the answers “good” and “very good”, the figures are the
following (always as estimated by the respondent):
a) the respondent him/herself: oral comprehension 67.4%, oral expression 31.5%, written
comprehension 25.1%, written expression 15.3%;
b) father of the respondent: oral comprehension 61.2%, oral expression 34% written
comprehension 30.4%, written expression 26.3%;
c) mother of the respondent: oral comprehension 56.2%, oral expression 30.4% written
comprehension 26.2%, written expression 23.7%.
Regarding the place where Galician is learned: in family 28.2%, in school 8.2%, with
friends 12%, with neighbours 7.5%, at work 3.9%, in media 39.3%, other means 3.5%.
According to more recent data from the Xarmenta Report (2010), which had access to
information from cultural bodies and civic associations, and which considers that the
estimated number of Galician-speakers in El Bierzo (León) is 23,500, Galician is the
109

majority language of the elderly inhabitants, around 75%. However, usage falls sharply in
adult speakers (aged 30-60) at 40%, while in the under 30 group the percentage is only
5%.
The figures shown in the previous paragraphs show that the native language of these
territories has reached a situation of serious decline. There are multiple causes, some
shared by Galician within the Autonomous Community of Galicia. But in 19th century
Galicia a literary renaissance began using the native language, which produced some
charismatic figures with whom the people identified.
As these territories belong to areas which are not part of Galicia, they do not identify (or
little identify) with those figures and the movement they represented, and this has reflected
on the lack of recovered pride as a language group.
This meant that when democracy was restored in Spain language claims in this respect
were very low and legal recognition in different laws was reduced almost to rhetorical
declarations. Indeed, there have been no effective language policies, because there was
also no insistent social demand.
THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH
The Statute of Autonomy of Castilla y León (Organic Law 4/1983, reformed by Organic
Law 14/2007) establishes in its article 5.3 that “the Galician language shall enjoy respect
and protection in the places where it is habitually used”.

The Education and Culture Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved
on 9 April 1997 a non-binding resolution whereby the Government of the State was urged,
in collaboration with the Xunta of Galicia and the Junta of Castilla y León, to enable the
Galician language to be taught in non-university institutions in the western part of the El
Bierzo comarca.

The Education and Culture Committee of the Legislature of Castilla y León approved in a
session held on 30 November 2000 a non-binding resolution whereby the Junta of Castilla
y León was urged to allow the Galician language to be taught as optional course matter in
110

public institutions offering primary or secondary school education in the territories of
Castilla y León bordering on the Autonomous Community of Galicia where majority
Galician language usage is found.

As a consequence of the signing on 30 August 2006 in Ponferrada of the new General
Collaboration Protocol between the Xunta of Galicia and the Community of Castilla y León
for promotion of the Galician Language in territories bordering the Autonomous
Communities (El Bierzo and Sanabria) and to guarantee teaching quality, the Regional
Ministry of Education regulated the offer of the Programme for the Promotion of the
Galician Language, by means of “Instruction of 26 September 2006 from the Directorate
General of Educational Organisation and Planning, determining the promotion of the
Galician language in non-university institutions beginning in the 2006-2007 academic
year”.

We must highlight Order EDU/1190/2007 of 28 June, which establishes as optional
baccalaureate course matter “Galician Language and Culture” and approves its
curriculum. The offering of this optional material is conceived as a continuation of that set
out in the 4th year of ESO [Obligatory Secondary Education].

The Royal Galician Academy comments that despite this mention in the Statute of
Autonomy, Galicia is still far from the condition of official language. An example of this is
what is set out in Law 1/1998 concerning the Local System of Castilla y León, whose
article 24.1 establishes that “the denomination of municipalities must be in the Castilian
language, respecting the existing denominations when this law takes effect, without
coinciding or causing confusion with others of the territory of the State”.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

According to the Xunta of Galicia, the Galician language’s presence in social, cultural and
media life is far from significant. In the cultural context the existence of associations
making continual efforts to encourage the use of Galician language in Galician-speaking
areas of the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León must be stressed. To cite a
concrete example, since 2005, the year it began to take its first steps, the “Xarmenta”
Bercian Language Association has undertaken a wide range of activities (cinema cycles,
111

theatre performances, school activities, prizes, etc) with this aim, counting economic
support from the General Secretariat for Language Policy of the Xunta of Galicia.

On the other hand, transmissions from Galician Television and Galician Radio are
received in a large part of both comarcas and have high audience ratings. As for the print
media, the general-interest dailies with the most distribution in said areas barely make use
of Galician, though they do pay some attention to news items concerning the language.
The presence of Galician is also poor in the publishing world and on web-pages with
content concerning both comarcas.

For its part, the Royal Galician Academy comments that the presence of Galician in the
administrative sphere, if it exists, is incidental.

According to the Xarmenta Report (2010), Galician is not promoted in any news media
(radio, TV or press) established in El Bierzo and in Zamora. The little which may exist is of
Galician origin. Of the written media, in this area the Galician edition of El País is available
along with the Ourense edition of La Voz de Galicia, which insert some information and
contributions in Galician. Galician Radio, which transmits 24 hours a day in Galician, is
received in this area. Until the digital switch-off (29 January 2010), Galician Television
could be received, with high audience ratings. The switch to the DTT system will
henceforth prevent free reception of this channel.

In the territories where exterior Galician is spoken (mainly in Asturias and León) there are
cultural associations, some exclusively dedicated to defending the language. Among the
most active we recorded during this report’s analysis period were Fala Ceibe and
Xarmenta, Asociación Berciana da Lingua in El Bierzo; and Asociación Xente Nova das
Portelas in Zamora.

THE MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LINKS, IN THE FIELDS COVERED BY
THIS CHARTER, BETWEEN GROUPS USING A REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGE
AND OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE EMPLOYING A LANGUAGE USED IN
112

IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR FORM, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CULTURAL
RELATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE USING DIFFERENT LANGUAGES

According to the Xunta of Galicia and the Royal Galician Academy, the Cooperation
Agreement for promotion of the Galician language in the territories bordering the
Autonomous Communities (El Bierzo and Sanabria), signed in Vilafranca on 18 July 2001
by the Regional Ministry of Education and University Planning of the Xunta of Galicia and
the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture of the Junta of Castilla y León, was
extended to a General protocol for collaboration between the Xunta of Galicia and the
Community of Castilla y León for promotion of the Galician language in the territories
bordering the Autonomous Communities (El Bierzo and Sanabria). This protocol was
signed in Ponferrada on 30 August 2006, to be valid for five years. It establishes the
political guidelines for collaboration between both entities regarding promotion of the
Galician language in León and Zamora in non-university institutions. The possibility of
studying Galician in subsidised private institutions was also broadened.

On 4 May 2009 the Junta of Castilla y León and the Comarca Council of Bierzo signed a
four-year Framework Agreement to establish the general framework for cooperation
between the two entities. This agreement explicitly mentions in its Appendix III, in the
section on Education, “promotion of the Galician language in its territory by means of
attending meetings of the Committee for accompanying the General Collaboration Protocol
existing for that purpose between the Junta of Castilla y León and the Xunta of Galicia,
and the subsequent study of full participation of the Comarca Council of Bierzo in future
protocols after the current one expires in August 2011”.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

According to the Junta of Castilla y León, since academic year 2001/2002 the programme
for teaching Galician in El Bierzo and Sanabria (whereby those students who so desire
can learn the Galician language) has been undertaken in various educational institutions in
El Bierzo. The cited General Collaboration Protocol signed on 30 August 2006 by the
Xunta of Galicia and the Community of Castilla y León to promote the Galician language in
the territories bordering the Autonomous Communities (El Bierzo and Sanabria) assures
continuity of said programme. Under this programme, primary education offers the
113

possibility of taking the course on Knowledge of the Environment or Arts and Crafts in
Galician for one hour each week, using the same content as the students who only study
in Castilian. Secondary education likewise offers the possibility of studying the Social
Sciences course in Galician throughout the ESO [Obligatory Secondary Education], also
with the same content as the students studying in Castilian. There is also an option for
Galician Language and Culture in the 4th year of ESO and in the 1st and 2nd of
baccalaureate.

Measures taken in Primary Education

The timely dissemination of the Collaboration Protocol (as done in its time with the
previous agreement) so that all interested teaching institutions in León and Zamora could
be informed about the possibility of offering Galician language teaching led to a rapid
expansion of the network of institutions. In primary education (in León) the number grew
from the initial three institutions in the 2001-02 year to the current 12.

Noteworthy for its novelty was the extension in 2007-08 of the network of institutions
offering Galician language in the province of Zamora. The said programme was effectively
started with that course at the “Tuela-Bibey” Public College in Lubián, a locality in the
comarca of Alta Sanabria in Zamora province.

Contrasting with what has occurred at institutions in El Bierzo, to date no Zamora college
has asked to offer the Galician Language Promotion Programme.

Measures taken in Secondary Education

Order EDU/965/2005 of 14 June is extremely important, as it establishes the optional
course “Galician Culture and Language” in Obligatory Secondary Education and approves
its curriculum. It is an optional course prepared in collaboration with the Xunta of Galicia
which opens the possibility of obtaining a certificate recognising basic level linguistic
competence.

Likewise important was Order EDU/1190/2007 of 28 July, establishing the optional
baccalaureate subject of “Galician Language and Culture” and approves its curriculum.
114

The teaching of this subject is conceived as being a continuation of that implemented in
the 4th year of ESO.

Measures taken regarding Language Schools

Due to its proximity to the Autonomous Community of Galicia, Galician has been taught in
the Official Language School of Ponferrada since the 2002-2003 academic year. There are
currently 65 students studying Galician in courses covering three levels: basic,
intermediate and advanced.

Measures taken regarding teacher training

The Junta of Castilla y León and the Xunta of Galicia organised and held the “Initiation
Level Galician Language Course” from 31 January to 28 April 2005 at the CFIE of
Ponferrada. Some 26 teachers participated in the 2004-05 course, of which 22 obtained
the corresponding certificate.

During the 2005-06 course, between 17 January and 2 March the 75-hour “Perfecting
Level Galician Language Course” was held at the CFIE of Ponferrada (60 hours
attendance required), in which 15 masters were admitted and enrolled, of whom 14
obtained the corresponding certificate.

Evolution of enrolment of Galician language students:

During the 2001-2002 course there were three Pre-school and Primary Education
institutions which began offering Galician Language per the Cooperation Agreement, for a
total of 156 participating students; in 2008-2009 there were 13 Pre-school and Primary
Education institutions which offered Galician Language, for a total of 884 participating
students and a human resources outlay comprising the hiring of eight masters.

Galician Language was also offered in four Secondary Education Institutes (IES), for a
total of 147 students and 4.5 teachers. At the Official Languages School of Ponferrada,
there are, as indicated, 65 students enrolled in this course and two teachers hired. All in all
this results in a total of 1,096 students studying the various teaching levels of Galician
Language in 2009-10, and 14.5 contracted teachers.
115

The school institutions in the El Bierzo comarca in León which offer the Programme have
received various prizes annually awarded by the Regional Ministry of Education of the
Xunta of Galicia.

Regarding the Official Languages School of Ponferrada and its teaching of the Galician
language, the Xunta of Galicia indicates that the curriculum was set for the basic and
intermediate levels in 2007 and for the superior level in 2008. The Xunta asserts that the
signing of the General Collaboration Protocol in 2006 implied, among other improvements
with respect to the previous protocol signed in 2001, extending the educational offer to
subsidised private institutions. It must nevertheless be noted that in the 2006-2008 period
none of these institutions joined the programme. Another advance partly made possible by
signing the 2006 protocol was that Galician language was included as an optional course
in the 4th year of ESO (2006-2007 academic year) and in the two baccalaureate years
(2007-2008 academic year), as opposed to the period prior to 2006, when Galician was
only used as a teaching language in the subjects of Arts and Crafts and Knowledge of the
Environment in pre-school and primary education, and in Social Sciences in secondary
education. The results obtained may be said to be positive, as shown by the progressive
increase in the number of students choosing to study the “Galician Language and Culture”
subject each year since it began to be taught in 2006-2007.

The Royal Galician Academy specifies that Galician language is taught as an option at 13
primary institutions; in secondary it is offered at three institutions. In various institutions
there is also the option to take non-linguistic subjects (Knowledge of the Environment) in
Galician.

In academic year 2006-2007 925 students were taking Galician and in 2007-2008 999
students. In 2008-2009 the number of students took Galician in León was 1,038, in Preschool and Primary Education, Secondary Education and at the Official Languages School
(EOI) of Ponferrada. In 2009-2010 the number of enrolled students is 1,096 (2010
Xarmenta Report), indicating a slight upward trend.

In Zamora, the Royal Galician Academy specifies that Galician is offered at a Primary
institution (Lubián, 19 students, 2008-2009 academic year, according to the Xarmenta
report). At the Institute in Puebla de Sanabria the subject of Galician is not offered, even
116

though envisaged in the aforementioned Agreement. The number of students taught in
Galician is tending to drop due to the non-existence of school-age population.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

Regarding publications, there is a large amount of linguistic research (including some
theses) on Galician on the peripheral fringe, as well as the publication of texts by authors
pertaining to this area such as Antolín Sánchez Mediante 1880-1944 (from Vegadeo),
Antonio Fernández y Morales 1817-1896 (from El Bierzo), among others.

The language’s identity and its socio-linguistic situation has also been the subject of
scientific meetings and congresses such as the 2nd Permanent School Fermín Penzol
(held on 27-29 October 2006 by the University of Vigo in Villafranca and Cacabelos,
whose town halls collaborated) and the 3rd Permanent School Fermín Penzol (held on 2527 January 2008 by the University of Vigo in Puebla de Sanabria, Lubián and Hermisente,
whose town halls collaborated).

Regarding the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter
for Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

2.1.3 GALICIAN IN ASTURIAS
INTRODUCTION

According to the Government of the Principality of Asturias, Galician in Asturias, Asturian
Galician, Asturian-Galaic, Fala, western Asturias Fala or Astur-Galician is spoken by some
41,083 people in the rural part of western Asturias. The Xunta of Galicia, which says it has
no reliable data regarding the Galician language’s socio-linguistic situation in the territory
of the Principality of Asturias, due to a lack of corresponding studies, estimates that about
40,000 people either speak Galician as their initial language or habitually use it in social
interactions. For its part, the Royal Galician Academy indicates that a variety of Galician is
spoken in 18 municipalities in far western Asturias with 44,916 inhabitants. It nevertheless
explains that in the eastern parishes of four concejos [munipalities] (Navia, Allande,
Villaión and Ibias) varieties of western Asturian and not eastern Galician are spoken,
although it may contain traces of Galician (as opposed to Asturian).
According to data from the 2nd Socio-linguistic Study of Asturias – 2002 by Francisco J.
Llera Ramo and Pablo San Martín Antuña (published by the Asturian Language Academy
in 2003), seven of every ten people surveyed (72%) say they speak Asturian Galician, one
of every five (24%) say they can read it and one of every six (16%) say they can write it,
while the level of passive comprehension reaches 22%. As for language use, one in four of
those interviewed (24%) say they are more at home expressing themselves in Galician
than in Castilian and one in three (34%) say they use both languages equally well. Only
7% said they expressed themselves better in Castilian. In any case, Galician in Asturias is
preferred for more personal or family situations, with Castilian reserved for more formal
uses.

Asturian Galician is also the mother tongue of the majority, for two of every three people
(67%) use it as a first language, either alone (50%) or along with Castilian (17%). One of
every three people (32%) uses Castilian as mother tongue. The generational decline is
evident, as nearly six of every ten people use Asturian Galician with their parents and no
more than three in ten use it also with their children.

As indicated previously in this report, the Royal Galician Academy conducted a survey
between October and August 2004 of 460 people between 15 and 54 years old in
118

Galician-speaking territories covered by this report: Asturias, 217 respondents in the
concejos of Castropol, El Franco, Navia and Tapia. We refer to the results of that survey in
the section on Galician in León.

The said Royal Academy nevertheless points out some conclusions regarding the study in
comparison with previous ones. The studies reflect the same tendency for the number of
speakers to decline; indeed, in the ten years between the two surveys, in overall terms the
number of habitual speakers dropped from 75% to 67%. When these figures are broken
down by age the percentages for the minor age group are much lower. The causes for this
decline are multiple. On the one hand, as these territories administratively pertain to other
provinces, they do not identify (or little identify) with the renaissance and defence of
Galician and this has impacted the lack of restored pride as a language group. This meant
that when democracy resumed in Spain the language claim was very low and the legal
recognition in various laws practically limited to rhetorical statements.

There have been no effective linguistic policies, because there has also been no insistent
social demand. According to the Royal Galician Academy, in the case of Asturias the issue
is aggravated by the fact that institutions do not recognise the speech types used in the
western fringe bordering on Galicia as a variety of the Galician language and reject any
kind of cross-border cooperation; it considers that the creation of a separate spelling and
morphological standard is even being developed.

That academy, which defines itself in article 1 of its Statutes as being a “scientific
institution whose fundamental aim is the study of Galician culture and especially the
learning, defence and promotion of the Galician language”, and in article 4 declares that
“Galician language is understood to be that proper to Galicia as well as its variants spoken
in exterior territories” (among which Asturias is listed), views with concern the grave
situation of decline among Galician language speakers in the territories outside the
Autonomous Community of Galicia.

Regarding the name of the language spoken in Asturias, although majority doctrine holds
that Galician is the language spoken by those inhabitants, its designation is not a peaceful
subject among the distinct public authorities. Hence the Government of the Principality of
Asturias and Asturian legislation label it Asturian Galician, considering that it has a neutral
and strictly philological nature. The Xunta of Galicia and the Royal Galician Academy,
119

which counts among its academics a representative of Galician in Asturias, defends on the
contrary the Galician nature of this language and calls it “Galician in Asturias”.

As this report does not seek to take any position on this unresolved question, the
designations “Galician in Asturias” and “Asturian Galician” are used, as that is how it is
used in writing by the Council of Europe, although it also indistinctly uses “Galician”.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

The Government of the Principality of Asturias asserts that Castilian or Spanish is the only
official language in Asturias. Asturian Galician (like Asturian) enjoys legal recognition and
a protection system set out in various legal texts: the Statute of Autonomy; the Law on the
Use and Promotion of Asturian (which places Asturian Galician on a par with Asturian); the
decrees on teaching curriculums; and the decrees to restore and officialise place names.
In this way Galician is transversally dealt with the measures concerning usage in
administration, place names and teaching, etc. That is, the legislation is common for
Asturian and Asturian Galician, not specific for each modality. Both enjoy the same
protection and support framework. Asturian Galician’s legal framework specifically
includes:
•

The Statute of Autonomy of the Principality of Asturias (Organic Law 7/1981 of 30
December, reformed by Organic Law 1/1999 of 5 February), which generically
covers oversight of the linguistic modalities of Asturias under the label “local
variants”;

•

Law 1/1998 of 23 March on the Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian, which
establishes in its article 2: “The system for the protection, respect, oversight and
development set out in this law for Bable/Asturian shall be extended, by special
regulation, to Galician/Asturian in the areas where it has the nature of specific
linguistic modality”;

•

Decree 38/2002 of 4 April, regulating the Advisory Council on Place Names of the
Principality of Asturias;

•

Decree 98/2002 of 18 July, establishing the procedure used when restoring and
establishing Asturian place names;

•

The 2005-2007 Asturian social normalisation plan;
120

•

Decree 56/2007 of 24 May, which regulates planning and establishes the primary
education curriculum in the Principality of Asturias;

•

Decree 74/2007 of 14 June, which regulates planning and establishes the
obligatory secondary education curriculum in the Principality of Asturias;

•

Decree 75/2008 of 6 August, which establishes the planning and curriculum for the
baccalaureate;

•

Decree 85/2008 of 3 September, which establishes the curriculum of the second
cycle of pre-school education;

•

Resolution of 29 December 2008 of the Regional Ministry of Education and
Science, which reorganises the teaching and curriculum of secondary education for
adults and regulates the test for directly obtaining the title of Graduate in Obligatory
Secondary Education;

•

Decree 123/2008 of 27 November, concerning the organic structure of the Regional
Ministry of Culture and Tourism: creation of the General Directorate of Language
Policy.

For its part the Xunta of Galicia affirms that Galician is not ranked as an official language
in the Principality of Asturias, and that Organic Law 7/1981 of 30 December, the Statute of
Autonomy of Asturias, makes no mention whatsoever of the Galician language. But it is
mentioned under the label “Galician/Asturian” in Law 1/98 of 23 March on the use and
promotion of Bable/Asturian, whose article 2 states that “The system for the protection,
respect, oversight and development set out in this law for Bable/Asturian shall be
extended, by special regulation, to Galician/Asturian in the areas where it has the nature of
specific linguistic modality”. According to the Xunta of Galicia, the “special regulation”
referred to there has never been developed by the Principality of Asturias.

Finally, the Royal Galician Academy comments that the Government of the Principality
approved on 24 February 2005 a Social Normalisation Plan for Asturian (2005-2007),
which treats Galician (in the plan called Asturian Galician or Fala in western Asturias)
similarly to Bable or Asturian. These were measures meant to promote use of the specific
language in administration, media and teaching, and to establish traditional place names
and make them official; etc.

121

The Royal Academy nevertheless recalls that in its second report on Spain the Committee
of Experts describes the situation of Galician in Asturias (par. 94) in these terms:
“However, during the “on-the-spot” visit several non-governmental sources underlined that
in practice very little value is attached to this language and that in several instances its
specificity compared to Asturian is denied. Although the competent authorities show a
commitment in principle to promote this language, a greater effort to promote the specific
identity of Galician in the Asturias seems to be necessary”. The aforementioned Royal
Academy considers that the situation described by the experts in the second report
continues and is getting worse.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

The Government of Asturias affirms that its goal is to promote and increase the visibility of
Asturian Galician in its territory, encouraging respect and public presence. The vitality of
Asturian Galician among the population is a positive factor in this endeavour, while the
area’s number of inhabitants (just over 40,000) is a limitation. Specific measures have
thereby been established to promote its use in public life, always respecting the principles
of freedom and voluntary use by citizens. Specifically, the normalisation and use of
Galician is supported: in the scope of the municipalities and communities in the Eo-Navia
region; in the publication of books; in usage by companies operating in the area; in local
media; and in the activities of cultural and citizens associations.

In recent years efforts have been made to standardise Asturian Galician to facilitate its
usage and dissemination. Regardless of its philological affiliation, Asturian Galician is
endowed with its own linguistic rules and spelling, set out in the Spelling Standards for
Asturian Galician published by the Asturian Language Academy in 2007, based in turn on
the Proposed Spelling and Morphological Standards for Asturian Galician, published in
1993 by the Government of Asturias. Said standards are generally used in written Asturian
Galician (official place names, for instance, use that spelling).

Various dialectal studies and lexical monographs on the region are also available (without
being exhaustive the following can be cited: El habla de El Franco (una variedad
lingüística del Occidente de Asturias), by José García García – 1983; Vocabulario d’A
Roda (Tapia), by Jacinto Díaz López and Manuel García Galano – 1994, with a second
122

improved version in 1996; Vocabulario de Mántaras (Tapia) Aportacióis al léxico del
galego-asturiano, by Xosé Miguel Suárez Fernández – 1996; Vocabulario da Veiga, by
José Antonio Fernández Vior – 1998; and El habla de A Veiga, by the same author),
although a standard-setting dictionary has yet to be produced.

Below we review the most outstanding aspects concerning the use and promotion of
Asturian Galician in public life:
•

Article 4 of Law 1/98 of 23 March on the Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian
establishes in its point 1 that all citizens have the right to use Bable/Asturian (and
Asturian Galician, per the provisions of its article 2) and to express themselves in
same, orally and in writing; in point 2 it explains that the use of Bable/Asturian is valid
for all effects in oral or written communications by citizens vis-à-vis the Principality of
Asturias.
If a citizen presents a document written in Asturian or Galician Asturian, if not directly
dealt with it may be forwarded to the Office of Language Policy and since 2009 to the
dependent Translation Unit of the General Directorate of Language Policy for its
translation, so that the corresponding administrative process can continue.
So until 2008 the Principality’s Office of Language Policy actually served as an official
translation service until creation of a specific body as envisaged in the Law on the Use
and Promotion of Asturian. A body of administrative texts in Asturian was hence
compiled and made available for the various respective entities.
Per an agreement dated 18 March 2009 the Asturian Government created a
Translation Unit depending directly on the General Directorate of Language Policy of
the Regional Ministry for Culture and Tourism. This new translation department, as set
out in Law 1/1998 of 23 March on the use and promotion of Bable/Asturian, is
responsible for ensuring the correctness and legal equivalence of translations of
Bable/Asturian or Asturian Galician and Castilian, providing public authorities with the
respective services of translation, interpretation and terminology. It uses a simple
procedure, an ordered operational mechanism and the speed necessary for proper
functioning of the corresponding administrative process. The duties of this Translation
Unit are: to translate or certify validity, depending on the case, of any texts to be
published in Asturian in the Official Gazettes of the Principality of Astrurias and the
General Council of the Principality of Asturias; to undertake any Bable/Asturian /
123

Castilian or Asturian Galician / Castilian translations required by either public powers
exercising their responsibilities or by advisory or assessment bodies of the Principality
of Asturias in matters concerning the use and promotion of Bable; and for any other
function in which the translation material is requested by legal order. The translation
unit also assumes all functions concerning the translation, interpretation and
terminology of Asturian Galician;
•

The signing in 2009 of a Protocol to the Framework Collaboration Agreement between
the Administration of the Principality of Asturias and the University of Oviedo for the
Asturian/Castilian Translation of Writings and Documents Presented in the General
Registry or in the Auxiliary Registries of the University of Oviedo, in which Asturian and
Asturian Galician are treated equally. This protocol functions under the aegis of the
Framework Agreement signed in September 1996 by the Principality of Asturias and
the University of Oviedo with the aim of facilitating permanent collaboration between
both institutions in matters of an academic, scientific and cultural nature of interest for
Asturian society. Specifically, this protocol establishes the framework and conditions
governing collaboration between the Regional Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the
Principality of Asturias and the University of Oviedo for translating (via the Translation
Unit of the Principality’s administration) into Castilian writings received by the University
of Oviedo in Asturian, as well as other related translations or consultations agreed to by
either institution;

•

Regarding local authorities a number of town halls and communities have in recent
years added services or offices for language normalisation, promoted and economically
backed by the Government of Asturias. Specifically and with respect to the Asturian
Galician area, in 2008 an Office for the Coordination of Cultural and Language
Activities opened in the Navia Historical Park, which groups nine town halls (Boal,
Coaña, El Franco, Grandas de Salime, Illano, Navia, Pesoz, Tapia de Casariego and
Villayón). Another Office for the Coordination of Cultural and Language Activities
opened in the Community of Oscos-Eo, which groups the municipalities of Castropol,
Vegadeo, San Tirso de Abres, Taramundi, Villanueva de Oscos, San Martín de Oscos
and Santa Eulalia de Oscos.
The opening of these two offices means that the Asturian Government virtually covers
all the territory where Asturian Galician is spoken;

•

Use of Asturian Galician by institutional representatives: the Asturian Government,
especially via the Directorate General of Language Policy, uses Asturian Galician in
124

oral and written communications addressed to the territory of Navia-Eo. The
(autonomous and municipal) institutional representatives frequently use Asturian
Galician in public acts;
•

Cultural production: in recent years its use has been consolidated in cultural
expression, for a large number of musicians, writers, theatre groups, etc, chose to use
this language modality, thus contributing to its prestige and social standing. Keep in
mind that we are talking about a small population (41,000 inhabitants in the region) with
a logically limited number of creators, albeit with a notable vitality encouraged by public
institutions – for example, in organisation of the October 2008 “1st Meeting of Asturian
Galician Writers” in A Veiga and in publication of the first literary magazine, Trabatel,
now issuing its second edition;

•

Recovery and standardisation of place names: the Government has worked to recover
and officialise place names in various municipalities. In those concejos whose place
names have already been officialised by the Government of Asturias, a public
information campaign was undertaken to increase awareness of traditional names,
explaining why it is necessary to make them official and use them. The campaign was
conducted by the Government in collaboration with the town halls and provided
neighbours, institutions, teaching institutions and companies with a foldout guide
containing the list of official names and a map;

•

Training: organisation of basic Asturian Galician courses promoted by town halls in
collaboration with the Government of the Principality and addressed to citizens,
municipal employees and journalists;

•

Implementation of language awareness campaigns:

Year 2006: Radio advertising campaign to promote the presence of Asturian culture
in the company and business context. The campaign took place during
the Christmas period with a view to encouraging purchases of native
language books and music, using the text: “Nestas Navidades, fai el
que máis presta. Regala un libro y un disco na túa fala. Á xente que
queres, regálayes un pedacín da túa terra. Oficina de Política
Llingüística. Conseyeiría de Cultura del Principao d’Asturias” [This
Christmas do something useful. Give a book and record in your
language. Give those you love a piece of your land. Office of Language
Policy. Regional Ministry of the Principality of Asturias];
125

Year 2006: Campaign on use of Asturian in business. The campaign offered
merchants shop window labels with the word “Rebaxas” (Sale) and
signs for the business’s entrance with the words “Aberto/Pechao”
(Open/Closed).
•

Use of the language in news media: by the annual award of subsidies to the news media
for the social normalisation of Asturian and, in its context, of Asturian Galician economic
assistance budgeted at €380,000 is granted to news, radio, television or Internet outlets to
cover expenses deriving from the production of spaces where Asturian (or Asturian
Galician as appropriate) is used habitually in general information, in periodical and
established spaces or in extraordinary programmes of special interest; such use must
however always contribute to the normalisation and enhanced standing of the language’s
social use and be in spaces pertaining to the respective news media and assumed by
same;
Specifically, the two subsidised spaces for Asturian Galician are:
Television programme “Cousas nosas” on Localia ORT (4,000 euros).
Radio programme “Falando a xeito” on Cadena SER (2,800 euros).

The “Rapalacóis” Cultural Association also maintains the website
http://www.falaviva.net, which includes news items exclusively in Asturian Galician;
•

Programme of subsidies for the normalisation and use of Asturian Galician: several
town halls in the region regularly receive subsidies to standardise Asturian Galician in
various activities. Also subsidised are associations’ activities, the publication of books
in Asturian Galician, studies about Asturian Galician and literary prizes, etc. Overall, a
total of 85,151.26 euros was laid out in the 2006-2008 period to subsidise activities in
Asturian Galician;
a) Book Publication: In 2006, 2007 and 2008 90% of the projects presented in Asturian
Galician were subsidised.

Also, in 2007 the “Best Song Prize” was created for works in Asturian or Asturian
Galician and has since been awarded annually with a view to acknowledging and
boosting creative work by the musicians of Asturias. The prize’s goal is to distinguish
the best song whose lyrics are in Asturian or Galician Asturian language, per criteria of
musical, literary and linguistic quality. The requirements are that it be a song
commercialised during the year before the call for applications, be published and
recorded for the first time and be an originally created musical work in any genre, and
not be existing traditional works or versions or adaptations of creative works originally
published in any other language. The prize announcement and award ceremony take
place during a gala held each year on 21 February. In 2008 the group Dulcamara won
with the Asturian Galician song “Nosh”.

g) Literary creation in Asturian Galician: With a view to enhancing the practical
possibilities of dedication to creative activity, subsidies are offered to promote literary
creation in Asturian Galician in the poetry, narrative, theatre and essay modalities. All
applications in the 2006-2008 period were subsidised:

For its part, the Xunta of Galicia holds that the presence of Galician in public news media
is virtually non-existent. Barring Galicia Television and Galician Radio, which extend their
broacasts to several municipalities in the Eo-Navia border area, no other public media
uses the Galician language, not even occasionally. The same can be said about the most
widely distributed print media in the region. Some citizens groups, such as the Abertal

128

Association, have undertaken activities meant to raise awareness, achieve political
recognition and promote the use of Galician in the Eo-Navia region.

The Royal Galician Academy adds that the Television of the Principality of Asturias (TPA)
has been functioning since January 2006 and nowadays about 20% of its broadcasts are
in Asturian (the other 80% in Castilian), and that since it began it has never used the
Asturian variety of Galician. Until late 2009 viewers in the Galician-speaking region could
tune into Galician Television [TVG], which broadcasts continually in the Galician language,
despite the opposition of some official institutions and media in Asturias. But with the end
of analogue emissions in 2010 there is no free coverage for digital terrestrial TVG.

There is a digital daily (at http://www.vieiros.com/edicions/17/terra-eonavia/) which has a
special section for the Eo-Navia region in the Galician of Asturias. Forums and blogs, etc,
on the internet which use ordinary Galician or its Asturian variety are rare but do exist.

There is a discrete presence of literary and essay creation in publications on both paper
and electronic supports, in the variety called “Galician from Asturias” and the officially
denominated “Asturian Galician”.

Among the publications are a large number of language research works (including some
theses) about Galician in the exterior fringe, as well as editions of texts by writers from that
region.

Regarding cultural creations, noteworthy is production of the documentary titled Fronteiras.
Un percorrido polos límites xeográficos e culturais de Galicia [Frontiers – a trip through the
geographic and cultural limits of Galicia] (2007), focusing on the social and language
problems of Galician-speaking areas in Asturias, León and Zamora.

In areas where exterior Galician is spoken (mainly in Asturias and León) some cultural
associations exist solely to defend the language. Among the most active during the period
covered in this report are, for Asturian territory, “Abertal” (which defends and uses the
Galician of Asturias) and “Xeira” (which defends this language variety as Asturian Galician,
on the fringes of ordinary Galician).

129

THE MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LINKS, IN THE FIELDS COVERED BY
THIS CHARTER, BETWEEN GROUPS USING A REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGE AND OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE EMPLOYING A LANGUAGE USED
IN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR FORM, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE USING DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES

The Government of Asturias states that the governments of Asturias and Galicia have held
nine official summits to date (the last in April 2008), which include sector-related boards
set up to discuss different aspects affecting both Autonomous Communities. Yet none of
them have dealt with the language question and there are no agreements or draft
agreements by both Communities concerning Asturian Galician.

Note that Galicia and Asturias are neighbouring Autonomous Communities sharing many
cultural and historic ties, a link all the more evident in border areas of Asturias and Lugo
province. Yet in the Eo-Navia concejos [municipalities] the Government of Asturias holds
exclusive powers for language policies. This exclusive power derives from current
legislation and plans: the Statute of Autonomy, Law for the Use and Promotion of Asturian
and Decrees concerning place names, etc.

For its part, the Xunta of Galicia reports that in the 2006-2008 period no collaboration
agreement on language matters was signed by the Autonomous Communities of Galicia
and of the Principality of Asturias.

The General Plan for Normalisation of the Galician Language (approved by the Galician
Legislature on 7 September 2004) considered cross-border cooperation in language policy
matters. This cooperation has taken place between the governments of Galicia and
Castilla y León – a Protocol was signed in August 2006 (valid until 2011) between the two
Communities’ Regional Ministers for Education, consolidated on 20 January 2010 in a new
Protocol signed by the Presidents of the two Communities.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES
130

For the Government of Asturias, Law 1/1998 of 23 March on the Use and Promotion of
Bable/Asturian provides the legal framework for developing the policy of promoting said
language, which is extended to Asturian Galician in the areas where it is a native language
variety. That Law contains a chapter dedicated to teaching.

There is no doubt that the teaching of Asturian Galician is one of the most important
supports for the process of language normalisation. As established in the aforementioned
law, the subject of Asturian Galician is compulsorily in all of the region’s educational
institutions; its learning is voluntary and it is taught within the academic schedule and
considered an integral part of the curriculum.

The Government of the Principality of Asturias, aware of language promotion’s importance
in the educational system, has also been offering through its Regional Ministry for
Education and Science the tools it deems the most appropriate for ensuring that the
process of Asturian Galician schooling is offered with the same criteria as for other
subjects. In recent years steps have been taken to ensure standardised and quality
schooling:
-

The publication of Asturian Galician curriculums for all educational levels: Pre-school,
Primary, Secondary, Baccalaureate and Adults. Its references are as follows: Decree
85/2008 of 3 September, establishing the curriculum for the second cycle of Pre-school
Education; Decree 56/2007 of 24 May, regulating the planning and establishing the
curriculum for Primary Education in the Principality of Asturias; Decree 74/2007 of 14
June, regulating the planning and establishing the curriculum for Obligatory Secondary
Education in the Principality of Asturias; Decree 75/2008 of 6 August, establishing the
planning and curriculum for the Baccalaureate; Resolution of 29 December 2008 of the
Regional Ministry for Education and Science, which organises the teaching and
curriculum for Secondary Education for Adults;

-

Holding of activities to support the teaching of Asturian Galician: the area’s educational
institutions organise didactic concerts, literary workshops and theatre performances in
Asturian Galician, jointly promoted by the Regional Ministries of Culture and Tourism,
and Education and Science, of the Principality of Asturias;

-

Distribution of bibliographical material to support the teaching/learning process:
dictionaries, readers, methodological and didactic support material, didactic games,
etc;

-

Specific plan for continual training within the Regional Teacher Training Plan;
131

-

Supervision by the Educational Inspection Service of the schooling process;

-

Development of an information campaign on enrolment in the Asturian Galician course;

-

Website supporting teachers of Asturian Galician;

-

Proposed formation of a Working Group to produce manuals for teaching/learning
Asturian Galician.

The benefits of implementing this policy to support the Asturian Galician schooling process
have resulted in maintaining the number of institutions offering the subject, the number of
students who choose it and the number of teachers hired to teach it.

In all levels and stages at primary and secondary schools in the Principality of Asturias, the
subject of Asturian Language or Asturian Galician, depending on the institution’s location,
is compulsorily offered by the institution; for the students it is a voluntary option. Since
academic year 2005-2006 the Regional Ministry for Education and Science has counted
an employee responsible for coordinating and monitoring schooling in the subject of
Asturian Language or Asturian Galician, holding periodical meetings with teachers and
backing training courses, etc.

The aforementioned teacher training is an action of major importance within the process of
teaching the Asturian Language and Asturian Galician. After an initial period in which
training was undertaken by institutions such as the Asturian Language Academy and the
Regional Ministry for Education and Culture, since 1994 the University of Oviedo has been
offering for separate titles courses to become an expert and specialist in Asturian
Language. On the other hand, in the framework of the Regional Teacher Training Plan, the
Regional Ministry for Education and Science works with the Asturian Language Academy
to offer courses meant to develop teacher training. This collaboration has been developed
for the authorisation and capacity-building of teachers who teach Asturian Galician in
educational institutions in the Navia-Eo area. Also, and per the Regional Teacher Training
Plan, the Regional Ministry for Education and Science has conceived a specific
programme for teachers of Asturian language and Asturian Galician. Courses, seminars,
working groups and symposiums, etc are offered and held, to ensure continual training of
the teachers teaching this subject in the different stages of the educational system.
The Royal Galician Academy notes that during the period covered by this report the
Regional Ministry of Culture, News Media and Tourism of the Government of the
Principality of Asturias conducted (simultaneously with those for Asturian) information
campaigns meant to encourage primary and secondary school students to sign up for the
optional subject of “Asturian Galician”. In the academic year 2005-2006 campaign, it was
indicated that the number of students enrolled in this subject during the previous academic
year had been 256 at “Schools” and 184 at “Institutes”. According to reports not broken
down the trend is downward.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS
133

In Asturias there is only one university, that of Oviedo, which in its Statutes (approved by
Decree 233/2003 of 28 November of the Principality of Asturias and published in the
Official Gazette of the Principality on the date 17 December 2003) centres its study and
research efforts in Asturian and not Galician.

Regarding usage strictly in the scopes of research, the University of Oviedo nevertheless
modified in 2009 its regulations to include the possibility that citizens can address
themselves to same in Asturian (or Asturian Galician).

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

134

2.2. ASTURIAN AND LEONESE (ASTURIAS AND CASTILLA Y LEÓN)

Asturian is the language spoken in different municipalities of the Autonomous Community
of the Principality of Asturias, except on the Community’s western fringe, where Galician is
spoken. Leonese is what is spoken in several municipalities of the principalities of León
and Zamora of the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León.
These languages shall be reported, separating by epigraphs those spoken in the

Principality of Asturias and in the Autonomous Community of Castilla y León, in
accordance with what is set out in article 7 of the European Charter for Regional or
Minority Languages, with an introduction providing general information on the language’s
situation in each of those two Autonomous Communities.
The reason for giving these two languages a separate treatment within a same epigraph of
the report derives from examination of the doctrine of the historian Menéndez Pidal, who
defined Astur-Leonese as being a linguistic domain between Galician-Portuguese and
Castilian, linguistically placed in the West Iberian group and arising due to the particular
evolution Latin underwent in the kingdoms of Asturias and León. The Astur-Leonese
subgroup is subdivided into occidental, central and oriental Astur-Leonese, and is at the
same time called Asturian (as in the Statute of Autonomy of Asturias), Leonese (as in the
Statute of Autonomy of Castilla y León) and Mirandese in Miranda do Douro (officially
recognised by the Portuguese Republic).
To report on these languages the Junta of Castilla y León and the Government of the
Principality of Asturias (regional administrations) have been consulted. Also consulted
were the respective ministries (state administration).
2.2.1 ASTURIAN IN ASTURIAS
INTRODUCTION
According to various socio-linguistic surveys produced by the Government of the
Principality of Asturias, some 250,000 people speak Asturian (a fourth of the population of
Asturias), a significant minority.

135

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

The legal framework for this development is on the one hand the Statute of Autonomy and
on the other Law 1/1998 on the Use and Promotion of Bable/Asturian.

Language policy in Asturias was implemented in the very first legislature of the Asturian
Autonomous Community in response to the demand by a part of society which sought
concrete measures for language promotion and protection.

There has since been a tacit consensus regarding that language policy, which has
determined the action lines all these years, almost independently of the political parties
forming the government and with the active principle of promotion and voluntariness.
These guidelines for language policy are sustained on four pillars: fomenting use,
teaching, news media and place names, which also correspond to chapters II and V of the
aforesaid Law on the Use and Promotion.

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

The Government of the Principality of Asturias created in 2003 the Public Communication
Entity of the Principality of Asturias, a public service contributing to the political, territorial,
linguistic and social cohesion of Asturias. Two multimedia companies depend on this
entity: Televisión del Principado de Asturias S.A. (TPA S.A.) and Radio del Principado de
Asturias S.A. (RPA S.A.).

Since its creation, Radio Televisión del Principado de Asturias (RTPA) has met the media
demand of Asturian society as a faithful reflection of the pluralistic reality of the
Autonomous Community. In this regard, and bearing in mind the news media’s influence
on the behaviour of speakers, RTPA has ensured that its programming maintains an
attitude of special respect and support for the Asturian language, promoting its use and
where necessary its maintenance – all in compliance with current legislation.

There are thus specific programmes in the Asturian language, on both public radio and
television. Some of these programmes are backed by the Regional Ministry of Tourism of
136

the Principality of Asturias, which endorsed the Asturian language’s presence in the Public
Communication Entity of the Principality of Asturias:
Year 2007:
Instruction to manage material, technical and service-related actions required to
dub in Asturian the television programme titled “El Cuentacuentos de Presta
Asgaya”, comprising 145 chapters. An amount of €39,886.60 was set aside for this
agreement.
Years 2007 and 2008:
Instruction to manage material, technical and service-related actions needed to
produce the television programme “Camín de Cantares”, whose aim is to preserve
the extensive oral tradition of Asturian culture vis-à-vis traditional music with songs
and ballads, as well as dance, with a total of 26 30-minute chapters. This
audiovisual work is broadcast by Televisión del Principado de Asturias SA; an
amount of 114,336.88 euros (14,300 euros in 2007; 100,036.88 euros in 2008) was
set aside for this agreement;
Instruction to manage the material, technical and service-related actions needed to
produce the television programme “Pieces”, which is meant to disseminate and
promote use of the Asturian language among citizens, with a total of 47 30-minute
chapters. This audiovisual work is broadcast by Televisión del Principado de
Asturias SA; an amount of 210,690 euros (22,000 euros in 2007; 188,690 euros in
2008) was set aside for this agreement.

The Government of the Principality of Asturias contributes to the dissemination of Asturian
in the news media by drawing up economic support plans to ensure that news media
habitually use the native language. Through the annual award of subsidies to the news
media for the social normalisation of Asturian and, in its context, of Asturian Galician
economic assistance is thus granted to periodical, radio, television or internet companies to
cover expenses deriving from the production of spaces where Asturian (or Asturian Galician
in its context) is used habitually in general information, in periodical and established spaces
or in extraordinary programmes of special interest; such use must however always contribute
to the normalisation and enhanced standing of the language’s social use and be in spaces
configured as pertaining to the respective media and assumed by same.

The annual award of subsidies to the media facilitates the broadcast of a good number of
radio programmes in Asturian or Asturian Galician. Specifically, between 2006 and 2008 a
137

total of 28 actions were financed, including cultural, musical and informative programmes
of a regional nature, sports broadcasts and those addressed to children and young people.
Three of the subsidised media outlets broadcast entirely in Asturian.

The annual award of subsidies to news media likewise facilitates the broadcast of a good
number of television programmes and spaces in Asturian or Asturian Galician. Specifically,
between 2006 and 2008 a total of 12 actions were financed, including informative, cultural
or school programmes; documentaries; and cartoon video clips.

The Television of the Principality of Asturias also offers varied television programming in
the Asturian language with the production and broadcast of the following programmes:
Pieces, Camín de Cantares, Nos, Al Aldu and Presta Asgaya.

Subsidies are annually awarded to companies for the production of music, cinema and
videos in the Asturian language or Asturian Galician, for an overall outlay in the 2006-2008
period of €230,000 (130,000 for musical production + 100,000 for cinema and video
productions).

The annual award of subsidies to news media is open to the participation of companies
holding news media in the Asturian context and enables economic support for the regular
publication of press articles in the Asturian language or in Asturian Galician. Specifically, a
total of 38 actions were financed, for both periodicals and magazines (digital or print)
published entirely in the native language, and others in Castilian which include pages in
Asturian language or Asturian Galician. Due to this support, Asturian and Asturian Galician
count an exclusive media outlet (the weekly Les Noticies) and are present in the most
widely distributed Asturian dailies (La Nueva España, El Comercio and La Voz de
Asturias), as well as in other medium-sized or small periodicals.

An “Advanced Asturian Language Course for Information Professionals” was taught in
2006 – a natural continuation of the basic level course offered in 2005.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

138

The autonomous administration counted in 2006, 2007 and up to November 2008 a
Language Policy Office dependent on the Directorate General for Cultural Promotion and
Language Policy of the Regional Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Said Office’s duties
involved the implementation, coordination with other administrations, control and
evaluation of the programmes needed to develop a language policy which socially
normalises and guarantees the use of Bable/Asturian, as well as those necessary for its
protection, promotion and dissemination.

By Decree 123/2008 of 27 November, of organic structure of the Regional Ministry of
Culture and Tourism (BOPA of 28-XI-2008), a Directorate General of Language Policy was
created, responsible for “the planning, implementation, coordination with other
administrations, control and evaluation of the programmes needed to develop a language
policy which socially normalises and guarantees the use of Bable/Asturian, as well as its
protection, promotion and dissemination. It will also carry out the Regional Ministry’s duties
with respect to the Advisory Council on Place Names”. The Language Policy Service and
an administrative translation unit depend on the Directorate General for Language Policy.

Regarding local administration, a number of town halls and communities have in recent
years set up Language Normalisation Offices or Services. In 2006 and 2007 there were a
total of 10 such services, covering 16 Asturian municipalities: Avilés, Cangas del Narcea,
Lena, Langreo, Mieres, San Martín del Rey Aurelio, Siero, Community of Cabo Peñas
(Carreño and Gozón), Community of Comarca de la Sidra (Nava, Villaviciosa, Colunga,
Sariego, Cabranes and Bimenes) and Gijón. Normalisation services thus cover the
population of all these concejos, which stands at 564,369 people. Also, in 2008 three new
services opened in the municipalities of Corvera, Laviana and the supra-municipal scope
of the Navia Historical Park which groups nine town halls (Boal, Coaña, El Franco,
Grandas de Salime, Eilao, Navia, Pesoz, Tapia de Casariego and Villayón), covering
56,357 personas. In sum, the services distributed throughout Asturian territory cover
620,726 people, well over half the Asturian population.

The Regional Ministry of Culture and Tourism considers it worthwhile, within the
framework of its support policy for town halls, to enable the implementation and functioning
of the Language Normalisation Services in the municipal context. For this reason it
annually grants via its Language Policy Office a subsidy to each of those town halls to hire
139

personnel to staff those services, besides also subsidising specific projects and activities
developed by same.

Endowing local authorities with Language Normalisation Services furthers development of
a broad range of activities which, always respecting the principles of freedom and
voluntary use by citizens, contribute to social dissemination of the Asturian language.

Language Normalisation in the municipal context implies a number of measures which can
be gradually applied per the criteria of each concejo: the use of Asturian in municipal
documents, in advertisements, in official announcements, in municipal news media, in
public street signs and labels, respect for traditional place names, names of municipal
dependencies, use of Asturian by part of the municipal authorities and employees, right of
citizens to freely use the Asturian language in their relations with municipal institutions,
language training for citizens, promotion of Asturian’s use in company and business life, as
well as in cultural undertakings, etc.

The Language Normalisation Services are technically coordinated by the Language Policy
Office and function as administrative units which resolve all language needs at internal
level and work externally with a view to achieving widespread use of Asturian. They offer a
public service to citizens, ensure that the residents’ language rights are respected, and
assume that the Asturian language pertains to the municipality, as it is the one used by
part of its population. It must be kept in mind that the town halls play a large role in
ensuring the widespread use of Asturian, due to their strategic placement in the
administrative hierarchy and their closeness to citizens and to the diverse socio-economic
and cultural activities in the territories they administer.
The Asturian government and its institutions support the Language Normalisation
measures promoted by the concejos and communities of concejos by financing the
functioning of their Language Normalisation Offices or Services, so that the latter can
implement all those measures to ensure the widespread use of Asturian. The following
table details the amounts of the subsidies granted by the Regional Ministry of Culture and
Tourism via its Language Policy Office to the various local bodies endowed with
Normalisation Services between 2006 and 2008.

Due to their respective responsibilities, most institutional activities concerning minority
languages are developed in the Regional Ministries of Education and Science, and of
Culture and Tourism. For example:
-

In the Regional Ministry of Education and Science:
o The Regional Minister of Education, and where pertinent the person delegated by
him/her, uses Asturian in all acts associated to the Asturian Language or to
teaching of the Asturian Language.
Literature Week;
Institutional Act of Letters Day of the Regional Ministry of Education;
Presentations of books and reports associated to teaching of the Asturian
language;
Acts to present and inaugurate courses associated to teaching of the Asturian
language;
Acts to present activities associated to teaching of the Asturian language, etc.
141

-

In the Regional Ministry of Culture and Tourism:
o Use of the Asturian language and Asturian Galician in signs, activity programmes
and radio spots prepared to publicise Asturias Day (8 September), with the
Language Policy Office charged with overseeing the necessary translations;
o Systematic use of the Asturian language and Asturian Galician to promote in the
press and on the radio the acts organised to commemorate each month of May the
“Asturian Literature Week” and the “Asturian and Asturian Galician Book Day”.

Also noteworthy is an institutional act which since 2004 has been annually undertaken as
part of the “Literature Week” commemorations: the General Council of the Principality of
Asturias (Asturian Parliament) organises a public institutional reading of texts written in
Asturian or Asturian Galician, with participation by ministers from the autonomous
government, national deputies and senators, autonomous deputies and figures from
Asturian public life (rector of the University, Síndico Mayor, Chairman of the Council of
Asturian Communities, head of the Language Academy, etc). For this occasion the
General Council produces a commemorative book of short stories in Asturian or Asturian
Galician in which numerous writers from the current Asturian literary panorama take part.
THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

In all levels and stages at primary and secondary education institutions in the Principality
of Asturias the subject of Asturian Language is compulsorily offered by the institution; for
students it is a voluntary option.
In primary education the course is chosen on a voluntary basis. Students may choose
Asturian Language or an alternative. The alternative to studying Asturian Language is
educational attention and should not imply the teaching of curricular content. In secondary
education the subject is optional. Students choose among various subjects (Asturian
Language, French, etc). The schooling figures and percentages are as follows:

In secondary teaching, as the subject is optional the schooling figures are different, but
have remained stable in recent years.

Teacher training is an action of major importance in the process of teaching Asturian
Language. After an initial period in which training was undertaken by institutions such as
the Asturian Language Academy and the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture,
since 1994 the University of Oviedo has been offering with specific titles courses to
become an expert and specialist in Asturian Language, respectively addressed to those
with diploma qualifications and degrees. These are the titles required to enrol in the
General Registry of Training which is in turn an indispensable requisite for teaching
Asturian Language classes. One more step was taken in 2008, when in the process of
reworking the university study plans to adjust them to the Bologna Plan, the creation of an
Asturian Language minor in the study plans of the Faculty of Philology and a mention in
the plans of the Teaching School were envisaged. They will serve to train future primary
143

and secondary school teachers, implying the definitive inclusion of Asturian in regulated
university teaching.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

In Asturias there is only one university, that of Oviedo, whose Statutes (approved by
Decree 233/2003 of 28 November of the Principality of Asturias and published in the
Official Gazette of the Principality on the date of 17 December 2003) establish in their
point 6.2:

The Asturian language shall be the subject of study, teaching and research in the
corresponding contexts. Its use shall also be treated as established by the Statute of
Autonomy and complementary legislation, guaranteeing that those who use it will not
be discriminated against.

On 30 September 2009 the Cloister of the University of Oviedo approved new statutes,
whose approval by the Council of the Government of the Principality of Asturias took place
in the month of February 2010. In these new statutes (in which point 6.2 was not modified)
a point 6.3 is added, whose content is as follows:

The University of Oviedo shall promote in the framework of its responsibilities the
actions needed for normalisation and development of the Asturian language.

Various actions undertaken by the University of Oviedo and the Government of the
Principality of Asturias to promote fulfilment of this precept can be highlighted:

A. Training offered by the University of Oviedo

In the study plans currently in effect at the University of Oviedo (not yet adjusted to the
European Area), the subjects of Asturian Language are included in the following titles:
a) Degree in Hispanic Philology
b) Degree in Romance Philology
c) Degree in Teaching: Foreign Language Specialty
144

On the other hand, the University offers two titles of its own in the framework of this theme.
These specific titles of the University of Oviedo complement the set of official curricular
teachings and along with them comprise the structure of the university’s teaching and
advanced training. Specifically, the University of Oviedo offers four categories of its own
titles, and two of them include Asturian Philology:

1) University Specialist in Asturian Philology: this title provides to holders of degrees in
Philology a scientific and specialised training in Asturian Philology (Language and
Literature) and enables them to teach the discipline of Asturian Language in secondary
education. The studies involve 56 credits (= 560 hours) and the following subjects:
•

Asturian and other peninsular linguistic domains

•

History of Asturian language I

•

History of Asturian language II

•

Asturian language I

•

Asturian language II

•

Asturian literature

•

Socio-linguistics of Asturian

•

Medieval Asturian texts

•

Asturian linguistic texts (modern and contemporary)

2) University Expert in Asturian Philology: this study programme enables degree holders
of Masters and Diploma qualifications in Teaching to teach the subject of Asturian
Language in primary education. It involves 42 credits (= 420 hours) distributed in the
following subjects:
•

Didactics of the Asturian language I

•

Didactics of the Asturian language II

•

History of the Asturian language

•

History of Asturian literature

•

Asturian language I

•

Asturian language II

This was the training offered by the University of Oviedo in Asturian language studies
during the 2006-2008 period covered by this report and which, as stated above, remains in
effect. The University of Oviedo has nevertheless programmed for the new titles adjusted
145

to the European Higher Education Space the following specialties, mentions and minors in
Asturian Language:

1) There are five University of Oviedo degrees which offer teaching of Asturian within their
study plans (all pending verification). All students of the four degrees taught at the
current Faculty of Philology (Classical and Romance Studies, English Studies, Spanish
Language and its Literature, and Modern Languages and their Literature) are thus
offered the possibility of taking a minor of 48 ECTS (8 subjects of 6 ECTS each) in
Asturian. The minor includes three study areas: Asturian Language, Asturian Literature
and History of the Asturian Language. On the other hand, the future Faculty of Teacher
Training and Education will offer students of the Master’s degree in Primary Education
the possibility of taking a mention of 30 ECTS (5 subjects of 6 ECTS) in Asturian;
2) University Master’s in Teacher Training for Obligatory Secondary Education,
Baccalaureate and Vocational Training: a specialty in Asturian is offered in this
master’s.

B. Accomplishment of studies and work

At the University of Oviedo, the departments in charge of teaching the different subjects
included in the studies described above (Sciences of Education, Classical and Romance
Philology, and Spanish Philology) are also endowed with teams of experts and
researchers in Asturian language able to direct research work in this area of knowledge.

The Asturian Government moreover specifically supports diverse studies and research
work on Asturian Philology (language and literature in Asturian or Asturian Galician). The
following studies were under way in the 2006-2008 period:

On the other hand, the research group “Seminariu de Filoloxía Asturiana”, attached to the
Spanish Philology Department of the University of Oviedo, assumes as a research field
anything associated to the study of Asturian language and literature; since its
establishment in 2003 it has promoted various projects:
•

History of Asturian Literature, coordinated by Xuan Carlos Busto Cortina (financed by
the Regional Ministry of Culture of the Principality and FICYT);

•

Variation Study on the Language in Asturias, coordinated by Ramón d’Andrés Díaz and
Xulio Viejo Fernández (financed by the University of Oviedo);

•

ETLEN (Study on the Linguistic Transition in Eo-Navia) coordinated by Ramón
d’Andrés Díaz (currently financed under the R&D Plan of the Spanish Ministry of
Science and Innovation);

•

Eslema. General Corpus of the Asturian Language, coordinated by Xulio Viejo
Fernández (borne by the 2006-2008 National R&D Plan of the Ministries of Education
and of Science and Innovation, and in collaboration with Brandeis and Georgetown
Universities in the USA);

•

PRESEEA (Project of Socio-linguistic Study of Spanish in Spain and America),
coordinated in Asturias by Álvaro Arias Cabal (with financing from the Spanish Agency
for International Cooperation);

•

CODA (Asturias Oral Corpus), coordinated by Álvaro Arias Cabal (financing from the
Regional Ministry of Culture of the Principality of Asturias);
147

•

Study Project on the legal and social status of European unofficial minority languages,
emerging project of international nature coordinated from Asturias by José Manuel
Pérez, Full Professor of Administrative Law (in which the “Seminariu de Filoloxía
Asturiana” will be in charge of all aspects associated to Asturian linguistics and sociolinguistics);

•

Agreement with the Regional Ministry of Culture of the Principality of Asturias to
produce a Asturian-Castilian/Castilian Asturian digital translator coordinated by Ángel
Neira García (Computer Department) and Xulio Viejo Fernández.

C. Use of Asturian at the University.

Besides usage strictly in research contexts, the University of Oviedo modified its
regulations in 2009 to include the possibility that citizens can address themselves to same
in Asturian.
a) Approval of the Regulation on presentation and reception of writings in
Bable/Asturian in the registry of the University of Oviedo. This regulation was
approved by the university’s governing council on 28 May 2009; it establishes that
the university’s General Registry and Auxiliary Registries shall register writings
written in Asturian language or Asturian Galician personally presented in the
framework of administrative procedures begun at the request of the interested
party;
b) The new Regulation’s development is undertaken in accordance with the Protocol
to the Framework Collaboration Agreement between the Administration of the
Principality of Asturias and the University of Oviedo for the Asturian/Castilian
Translation of Writings and Documents Presented in the General Registry or
Auxiliary Registries of the University of Oviedo, signed in 2009. This protocol is
sustained by the Framework Agreement signed in 1996 by the Principality of
Asturias and the University of Oviedo to facilitate permanent collaboration between
both institutions in matters of an academic, scientific and cultural nature of interest
for Asturian society.

Specifically, this protocol establishes the context and conditions in which collaboration
between the Regional Ministry of Culture of the Principality of Asturias and the
University of Oviedo is developed, with a view to undertaking (via the Translation Unit
148

of the Principality’s Administration) the translation into Castilian of writings received by
the University of Oviedo in Asturian or Asturian Galician, as well as other translations
or consultations in this area per agreement by both institutions.

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

2.2.2. LEONESE IN CASTILLA Y LEÓN

INTRODUCTION

There are no official figures on the number of Leonese speakers, though the most reliable
estimates (Estudiu sociollingüísticu de Lleón. Identidá, conciencia d'usu y actitúes
llingüístiques de la población lleonesa.) put the number of speakers at 50,000, situating
them in the provinces of León and Zamora. Other studies lower that figure to 25,000
speakers.

There is a certain amount of controversy regarding Leonese, as it lacks the officially
envisaged written norms. Some associations have proposed a standard of its own,
different from those already existing in the language domain (such as the one applied in
Asturias, regulated by the Asturian Language Academy, or the Mirandese Language
Institute, for the Mirandese used in Miranda do Douro), while other associations and
writers have proposed following the spelling rules of the Asturian Language Academy.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

This Leonese language is acknowledged in the new Statute of Autonomy of Castilla y
León. Article 5.2 of the Statute of Autonomy of Castilla y León, approved by Organic Law
14/2007, establishes that “Leonese will be subjected to specific protection by the
institutions due to its particular value in the Community’s linguistic heritage. Its protection,
use and promotion shall be subject to regulation.”

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

According to the Junta of Castilla y León, actions to protect and promote Leonese are
undertaken by the Directorate General of Cultural Institutions and Promotion via the
Castilla y León Institute of Language. In this regard, the following actions have been
carried out:
150

“Ramón Menéndez Pidal and the Leonese dialect 1906-2006”, symposia held on 2931 March 2006 at the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of León, which paved the
way to revising Menéndez Pidal’s contributions to dialectological studies, describing
two different language states: on the one hand the linguistic reality as found, and on
the other what is seen nowadays in the same territory. The meeting was divided into
six working sessions, in which professors from the four public universities of Castilla y
León, the University of Oviedo, the University of A Coruña and the University of Trásos-Montes e Alto Douro took part, all experts on the figure of Pidal and the Leonese
domain, among other subjects;
Presentation of the book “El dialecto leonés” on 14 February 2008 at the Castilla y
León Institute of Culture. This book contains minutes of the congress on Ramón
Menéndez Pidal which the Castilla y León Institute of Language organised in 2006 to
commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the publication of Menéndez Pidal’s
article “El dialect leonés”. This book’s presentation continues the efforts of various
specialists who considered the situation of Leonese, studying in detail the changes
that have affected the language over time in the Leonese domain’s various territories;
Congress-symposium on “Leonese in the 21st century” held on 6-7 May 2008. This
congress followed the line begun in 2006 with the symposium on Menéndez Pidal
and publication of the minutes of same the following year, in which specialists sought
to show the situation of Leonese in our time. Presentations were given on the
linguistic normalisation of Leonese and its recovery and role in the current world; this
was explained from the scientific standpoint and by the various associations that
support and defend its study and integration.

The Castilla y León Institute of Language is also preparing a symposium on Leonese to
take place in 2010. These congresses are arranged to take place every two years, with the
proceedings published in the interim period. The proceedings from the previous year’s
symposium were published over the course of 2009. The object of these symposia is none
other than to gather specialists to explain the situation of Leonese in our time.

On the other hand, the Castilla y León Institute of Language plans to produce publications
on the oral tradition of León province, in which the particular features of the different
modalities of Leonese are examined.

151

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

The use of Leonese/Asturian in citizens’ relations with state services in Castilla y León has
not been occurring; despite this, no demands, complaints, suggestions or use have been
presented to those services.

152

2.3.

PORTUGUESE IN CASTILLA Y LEÓN AND EXTREMADURA

To report on this language, the Junta of Extremadura and the Junta of Castilla y León
(regional administrations) were consulted. The “Alem Guadiana” Association was also
consulted via the Junta of Extremadura, which has actively and intensely collaborated with
the former, particularly by sponsoring with 10,000 euros in 2009 the holding in Olivenza of
symposia on Portuguese in Extremadura organised by that association.

INTRODUCTION

According to doctrinal studies in Spain, Portuguese is traditionally spoken in the districts of
A Bouza and Alamedilla (Castilla y León), the Jálama valley, Herrera de Alcántara, Cedilla
and the border fringe of Valencia de Alcántara and La Codosera and Olivenza
(Extremadura).

In Extremaduran linguistic geography, the extensive border area facilitated the appearance
of different dialectal varieties and speeches with strong Portuguese influence, as well as
areas where bilingualism was the norm until recent years.

Also according to said doctrinal studies, in the border raya [frontier region] of Extremadura
with Portugal, the Extremaduran speeches can be classified in four groups:
-

Group 1: the Jálama valley;

-

Group 2: Herrera de Alcántara;

-

Group 3: Cedillo and the border fringe of Valencia de Alcántara and La Codosera;

-

Group 4: Olivenza.

In those groups surviving usage is not the same. Groups 1 and 2 (Jálama valley and
Herrera de Alcántara in Cáceres province) have practically disappeared; an author
described them as a sort of archaic Portuguese, with medieval traits later influenced by
modern Spanish. The archaism would fundamentally be due to the localities’ isolation from
neighbouring Portuguese populations, which prevented subsequent evolutions of
Portuguese from reaching that dialectal modality.

153

On the contrary, groups 3 and 4 represent modern varieties of Portuguese. The basic
differences between these two groups primordially centre on the Portuguese dialectal area
with which they converge and with which they have historically maintained relations.

In the group comprising Cedilla and the area of Valencia de Alcántara and La Codosera
the available analyses to date are not sufficient. It is a group arising from the 18th century
on, due to Portuguese immigration from neighbouring regions of the Alentejo and in
Cedillo’s case from Beira.

In Olivenza’s case the historical reasons causing it to change hands from Portugal to
Spain in the early 19th century are well known. A significant number of qualitative studies
on “Oliventino” have considered that this particular speech of Olivenza is in a precarious
situation, for it has been subject to strong influence from Spanish and is nowadays limited
to elderly speakers.

Lastly, it must be noted that there is little available data on the use of Portuguese in
Leonese territory.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

The Junta of Extremadura is aware of the importance of boosting Portuguese language
knowledge as a first step towards greater mutual respect and understanding, and provides
numerous aid grants for Portuguese courses in the region.

The Office of Cross-border Initiatives (GIT) has financed Portuguese courses annually
since 1998. The number of applications has increased each year and the GIT has been
meeting society’s demands. At first the emphasis was on beginner’s courses; in
subsequent years the offer was extended to 40 and 90-hour courses for beginners and for
perfecting use. In recent years priority has been given to courses addressed to specific
groups and sectors: personnel from exporters, merchants, health professionals, police,
and employees of hotels, restaurants and public services. To offer the courses the
following are valued, among others: the teacher’s training, the course’s specialisation and
co-financing by entities. Private non-profit bodies, town halls and minor local bodies may
154

request such aid. Given the existing demand throughout the region, the course offer has
been diversified to facilitate learning at the greatest possible number of locations.

For its part, every year the Regional Ministry of Education of the Junta of Extremadura
grants assistance to the Peoples’ Universities to carry out training actions for adults; in
recent years a large number of Portuguese courses benefited from such grants.

During academic year 2005/2006 20 Extremaduran institutions therefore took part in the
Portuguese Language and Culture Programme, six in Cáceres province and the remaining
14 in Badajoz province. This is an official international programme developed since
academic year 1998-99 in collaboration with the Embassy of Portugal in Spain. For these
institutions the Regional Ministry of Education, Science and Technology of the Junta of
Extremadura requests native teachers from the respective section of the Portuguese
embassy in Madrid. These are integrated courses in which the subject professor and
native teacher make use of the didactic unity being practiced to transmit Portuguese
vocabulary, grammar and customs. The institutions must pertain to a place that is close to
Portugal and which contain a significant Portuguese resident community and a large
number of students who are Portuguese descendants. Complementary activities are
developed at these institutions, such as student exchanges, study visits to both countries,
cultural weeks about Portugal and Portuguese clubs, etc, in which all students and
teachers are involved.

In general, the Portuguese language’s presence in colleges and institutes is still not very
widespread, although it has grown year after year and there are increasingly more
secondary schools which offer Portuguese as a second foreign language. Whether by
means of assistance from the Junta of Extremadura or via the Portuguese Language and
Culture Programme mentioned above, the language is taught in one or another primary or

On the other hand, in various institutes which periodically make exchanges with Portugal
the teachers attend Portuguese courses in order to facilitate contact with their colleagues;
various schools also count the presence of Portuguese lecturers.
Regarding teaching personnel, there are periodical cross-border meetings of teachers
meant to enhance teacher training in foreign languages, encourage acquaintance and
social contact among teachers and enable cultural approaches in matters of innovation. In
2004 Badajoz hosted the 1st Symposia on Portuguese language teaching for foreigners,
which gathered in Badajoz a large number of the Portuguese teachers working in
Extremadura; in April 2006 the Association of Portuguese Professors in Extremadura
(APPEX) held the 1st Symposia on Portuguese Language and Culture of the Portuguesespeaking Countries. The CPRs (Teacher and Resource Centres) are also increasing their
Portugal-related activities and in recent years offered Portuguese language courses,
Portuguese culture courses and cross-border symposia for teachers.
Extremadura currently counts nearly 30,000 students of Portuguese and is the
Autonomous Community with the highest number of students of this language. This
situation should be studied in a broader context vis-à-vis the presence, preservation and
study of Portuguese throughout the Community.
For its part, the Junta of Castilla y León reports the following with respect to the
Portuguese language and regarding non-university education:
Portuguese language and culture programme in primary education
The Portuguese Language and Culture Programme is offered at five schools in three
localities in the province of Salamanca, in which a total of 492 students participate.

Official language schools

Portuguese has been taught at the Official School of Languages of Salamanca since the
2001-2002 academic year. In the current 2009-2010 academic year there are 214 students
grouped in ten groups encompassing all years of the three current levels.

For its part the Ciudad Rodrigo Section, which depends on the Official School of
Languages of Salamanca, has offered since it was established in academic year 20052006 the possibility of studying Portuguese language; figures for the current academic
year indicate the number of 45 students distributed in four groups, having completed the
basic and intermediate levels to date.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

In the university context major advances have also occurred; in 2004 the first promotion of
students with degrees in Portuguese philology graduated from the University of
Extremadura. Portuguese Philology was introduced in the framework of an ambitious
Junta de Extremadura programme to renew and enhance university studies in this region.

This is doubtless a consequence of the Extremaduran authorities’ decisive commitment to
Portugal, its language and culture. With more than 80 students currently enrolled, a
158

number which has grown ever year, there are more students of Portuguese Philology at
the University of Extremadura than anywhere else in Spain. Portuguese Philology is thus
helping Extremadura become the natural bridge joining the two Iberian cultures. For this
reason and due to the huge efforts made by the Portuguese Department’s teachers since
it was established, the Office of Cross-border Initiatives [GIT] in 2004 granted the degree
in Portuguese at the University of Extremadura the 2nd GIT Prize for PortugueseExtremaduran Cooperation.

Besides the said degree in Portuguese, the University of Extremadura teaches that
language in other specialty areas such as tourism, business and teacher training, etc. The
University of Extremadura counts a total of more than 700 students receiving Portuguese
language training.

Since it assumed responsibility for educational matters, the Junta of Extremadura has
supported efforts by the Official Language Schools to offer new Portuguese classes.
Portuguese was the language which saw the biggest increase in the number of students in
academic year 2000-01. In 2002-03 the number of official schools offering Portuguese
grew considerably and the student body reached a total of 1,049 students. Since 2004 it
has been possible to study Portuguese in all Official Language Schools in the region and it
has become the language most in demand after English.

The Public Administration School of the Regional Ministry of the Presidency has offered
Portuguese courses since 2000 within the programme for Public Employee Training of the
Junta of Extremadura; the number of applicants has risen significantly each year.

THE PROMOTION OF APPROPRIATE TYPES OF TRANSNATIONAL EXCHANGES, IN
THE FIELDS COVERED BY THIS CHARTER, FOR REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES USED IN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR FORM IN TWO OR MORE STATES

On 13 July 2009 the Junta of Extremadura hosted the signing of the Memorandum of
Understanding agreed to in Mérida (Badajoz) by Spanish Education Minister Ángel
Gabilondo and his Portuguese counterpart Maria Lurdes Rodrigues, whereby both
countries committed themselves to boosting the study of Spanish and Portuguese.
159

Extremadura was the first Community to adhere to the memorandum after it was signed,
via a collaboration agreement signed by the president of the regional government,
Guillermo Fernández Vara, which in the collaboration framework will later be extended to
other Spanish and Portuguese educational administrations.
To achieve this promotion of Spanish in Portuguese classes and vice versa, the
agreement thus also establishes the development of programmes meant to establish the
respective official languages as optional foreign languages in their corresponding
educational systems. The Education Ministries of Spain and Portugal will work together to
promote the learning of Spanish and Portuguese in the neighbouring country, so that they
can be offered as optional curriculum evaluation languages at schools in both states, as
well as training actions addressed to teachers.

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

2.4.

ARAGONESE IN ARAGON

To report on this language the Government of Aragon (regional administration) and the
affected Ministries (state administration) were consulted.

INTRODUCTION

The most reliable studies estimate that Aragonese is currently spoken by about 10,000
people in various areas of Aragon. It is mainly spoken in the north of the Autonomous
Community, in the comarcas [administrative regions] of Jacetania, Alto Gállego, El
Sobrarbe and the western part of Ribagorza, although it is also spoken in somewhat
Castilianised form in other comarcas of northern Aragon.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

The latest reform of the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon, per Organic Law 5/2007 of 20
April, established in its article 7, under the title of native languages and linguistic
modalities, the following:

“1. The languages and linguistic modalities native to Aragon constitute one of the most
outstanding expressions of Aragonese cultural and historical heritage and a social value
of respect, coexistence and understanding.

2. A law from the Legislature of Aragon shall establish predominant use of the
languages and modalities native to Aragon, regulate the legal framework, the usage
rights of the speakers from those territories, promote the protection, recovery, teaching,
promotion and dissemination of Aragon’s linguistic heritage and encourage in the areas
of predominant usage the use of the native languages in citizens’ relations with the
Aragonese public administrations.

3. No-one can be discriminated against on grounds of language”.

The approval in the Aragonese Legislature of Law 10/2009 of 22 December on the use,
protection and promotion of Aragon’s native languages complies with the aforesaid
161

mandate of article 7.2 of the Statute of Autonomy. The Government of Aragon is working
to determine the steps it should take to implement said law, which took effect the month
after it was published.

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

The literary creation prizes established by the Government of Aragon, such as the Arnal
Cavero Prize to promote literary creation and esteem among Aragonese language
speakers, have been annually consolidated.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

The Government of Aragon annually publishes collections such as “Pa de casa” “O pan de
casa nuestra” and “Temas educativos”, which contribute towards a more active presence
of this language.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

Public schools have offered Aragonese classes since 1997 on a voluntary basis in those
localities that request them. There are now more than 4,000 Aragonese students who can
exercise that right.

The Directorate General of Culture of the Government of Aragon has also promoted
cultural activities in educational institutions in the bilingual areas which request same
under the “Aragonese Languages Campaign” programme, a stage and musical arts circuit
for schools.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY

2.5. CATALAN IN ARAGON

To report on this language the Government of Aragon and the Generalitat of Catalonia
(regional administrations) and the pertinent Ministries (state administration) were
consulted.

INTRODUCTION

The consulted administrations contributed no updated figures on the number of speakers
or their geographic distribution.

In 2004 two surveys on linguistic usage of the Catalan language on the periphery of
Aragon were conducted, one by the Aragonese Statistics Institute and the other by the
Language Policy Secretariat of the Generalitat [Government] of Catalonia. The two studies
covered different areas, with the Generalitat’s survey focusing solely on municipalities
considered to be Catalan-speaking, while the Aragonese Statistics Institute studied all
municipalities in the five comarcas (la Ribagorza, La Litera, Bajo Cinca, Bajo AragonCaspe and Matarraña) where Catalan is present, even in municipalities considered
monolingual in Castilian (or almost so).

According to the Generalitat of Catalonia, Catalan is the habitual language of 73.6% of the
population of the municipalities where Catalan is present, Castilian is for 22.3% and 3.5%
of the population use both as habitual language. Extrapolating the figures to the population
field, some 29,023 people use Catalan as habitual language, 8,819 Castilian and 1,363
both equally.

According to the Aragonese Statistics Institute, Castilian in the habitual language of 49.0%
of the population of the eastern comarcas, Catalan is for 47.1% and 3.1% of the population
use both languages habitually. Extrapolating the figures to the population field, some
32.092 people use Castilian as habitual language, 30,860 Catalan and 2,004 both equally.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH
165

Here should be repeated what was indicated previously in the epigraph on Aragonese
regarding what is envisaged with respect to the new Statute of Autonomy of Aragon and
Aragonese Law 10/2009 which develops same in this linguistic matter.

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

The Government of Aragon has annually consolidated a number of literary creation prizes,
such as the Guillem Nicolau award to encourage literary creation and the speakers’
esteem for the Catalan language in Aragon.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

The Directorate General of Culture of the Government of Aragon promotes cultural
activities at educational institutions in bilingual areas which request same under the
“Aragonese Languages Campaign” programme, a stage and musical arts circuit for
schools.

THE MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LINKS, IN THE FIELDS COVERED BY
THIS CHARTER, BETWEEN GROUPS USING A REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGE AND OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE EMPLOYING A LANGUAGE USED
IN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR FORM, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE USING DIFFERENT
LANGUAGES

No agreements or pacts have been formalised by Aragon and Catalonia regarding the use
of Catalan in Aragon. The Generalitat of Catalonia has nevertheless recognised and
validated studies done in Catalan at primary and secondary schools in Aragon vis-à-vis the
certificates issued by the Language Policy Secretariat of the Generalitat of Catalonia which
accredit levels of Catalan knowledge for access to civil service posts in Catalonia.
166

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE
STAGES;

The Government of Aragon indicates that public schools have been able to offer Catalan
classes since 1984 on a voluntary basis in those localities which request same. There are
currently more than 4,000 Aragonese students who can exercise this right.

The Generalitat of Catalonia otherwise reports the approval of Order VCP/13/2007 of 24
January, modifying Order PRE/228/2004 of 21 June, concerning the titles, diplomas and
certificates equivalent to the certificates for Catalan knowledge of the Language Policy
Secretariat. The latter is updated to include a new equivalence with the intermediate level
Catalan certificate for the titles of secondary education (ESO) graduate issued in Aragon.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

The Government of Aragon mentions the University of Zaragoza as one of the Spanish
universities where studies can be pursued in Catalan. In fact, at this university proposed
research projects are annually studied to select those complying with the requisites of
urgency, necessity and quality. The projects undertaken in the financial years from 2006 to
2008 are the following:
•

AC Matarraña: Homage to the Romance scholar Artur Quintana. Research and
trilingual publication. Xandra. Estudios aragoneses de lengua y literatura.

•

Demo linguistic surveys of the Aragonese languages.

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

2.6

VALENCIAN IN MURCIA

To report on this language the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Region
of Murcia and the Government of the Valencian Community (regional administration) were
consulted.

INTRODUCTION

Valencian is used in Murcia in an area called “Carche” (Carxe), a comarca [administrative
region] bordering the Valencian Community which comprises 22 villages administratively
pertaining to the town halls of Yecla, Jumilla and Abanilla. They include settlements where
part of the population speaks Valencian, due to the arrival of several dozen families from
the neighbouring province of Alicante in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The Autonomous Community of the Region of Murcia (regional administration), the
Valencian Community (regional administration), the National Statistics Institute (state
administration) and the respective town halls (municipal administration) were consulted, to
the effect that there is no registry of Valencian speakers in the Autonomous Community. It
is therefore not possible to specify how many residents of El Carxe are Valencian
speakers, although it may be conjectured that in the total population of that comarca,
Valencian is only used among them and residually.

Regarding the number and geographic distribution of the main population centres in the El
Carche area, 2008 figures from the National Statistics Institute (INE) indicate that the
population is 674 inhabitants (in the municipalities of Jumilla, Yecla and Abanilla). This El
Carche comarca has gradually lost population due to the strong emigration caused above
all by the agricultural crisis, as agriculture is a fundamental activity in this comarca. In
some districts there are almost no permanent inhabitants. Although still registered in
districts of El Carche, most of the population lives in the villages of Yecla and Jumilla.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

168

Valencian is not officially recognised in the Autonomous Community of the Region of
Murcia.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

Regarding the use of Valencian in public life and in public news media in Murcia, as it is
not officially recognised in the Autonomous Community of the Region of Murcia, along with
the fact that the few inhabitants who use it live most of the year in municipalities where
Valencian is not used, means that Valencian is not used publicly in the Autonomous
Community.

There have nevertheless been initiatives to disseminate Valencian in this area of the
Region of Murcia, with the Valencian Language Academy offering Valencian classes in
Yecla on the respective town hall’s request until June 2008.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

There have been initiatives to disseminate Valencian in this area of the Region of Murcia.
As indicated above, the Valencian Language Academy offered Valencian classes in Yecla
at the respective town hall’s request until June 2008. A first Valencian course was
organised in this Murcian locality in 2005. It is organised by the People’s University (a
body depending on the town hall) and the Valencian Language Academy, which provides
the teacher and pays the teaching fees. The courses have been held without a break since
then, every year.
These courses are an example of collaboration between the Valencian Community and the
Region of Murcia to ensure the presence of Valencian in municipalities which have
Valencian-speaking minorities.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS
169

In 2008 the Valencian Language Academy (AVL), along with researchers from the
University of Alicante, conducted field work to ascertain Valencian place names in the
three Murcian municipalities comprising the comarca of El Carche.

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

2.7.

DARIJA IN CEUTA

To report on this language the Government of the City of Ceuta (local administration) and
the Government Delegation in the City of Ceuta (state administration) were consulted.

INTRODUCTION

a) Population structure of the city of Ceuta.

Very briefly, it must be stressed that Ceuta has an area of approximately 19.8 sq. km, with
a population of about 80,000 legal inhabitants. Its most characteristic feature is the
peaceful coexistence and convergence of different races and cultures, as well as its role
as a bridge for crossing or joining and point for meeting and communication between the
two continents of Europe and Africa.

The European population is currently still a majority, accounting for 55%; the remaining
45% of the population is comprised by the Arab, Jewish (2.5%), Hindu (1%) and Roma
(0.5%) populations, almost all immigrants.

b) Is Darija a regional or minority language?

Article 1 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages establishes that for
the purposes of the Charter “regional or minority languages” should be understood as
being languages:
“i) traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who
form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and
ii) different from the official language(s) of that State; it does not include either
dialects of the official language(s) of the State or the languages of migrants;

This legal definition of “regional or minority language” would a priori include the Arabic
dialect variety called Darija. A number of observations must nevertheless be made in this
regard:

1.- First of all, in the instrument ratifying the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages, “Spain declares that, for the purposes of the mentioned articles, are
171

considered as regional or minority languages, the languages recognised as official
languages in the Statutes of Autonomy of the Autonomous Communities of the Basque
Country, Catalonia, Balearic Islands, Galicia, Valencia and Navarre”. “For the same
purposes, Spain also declares that the languages protected by the Statutes of
Autonomy in the territories where they are traditionally spoken are also considered as
regional or minority languages. (...)”.

Thus, given that the Statute of Autonomy of Ceuta neither recognises as official nor
establishes any kind of special protection or support for Darija, that dialect would not be
deemed included in the scope of protection of the European Charter.

2.- Second, in the Preamble of the European Charter, a true synthesis of the causes and
ideals driving the signing of that international commitment, the second “considering”
clause refers to “protection of the historical or regional minority languages of Europe,
some of which are in danger of eventual extinction”.

Darija is obviously not a part of this historic European cultural acquis which runs the
risk of disappearing due to a gradual continental linguistic standardisation. It is actually
not properly a European language “in danger of eventual extinction”; indeed, as shall
be seen below, it is a “new” language on the territory of a European state and not an
“old” language running the risk of disappearing.

3.- Third, and largely to reinforce the previous observation, Darija is a language which has
arisen in Ceuta as a language originating with immigration and therefore, in
accordance with article 1 ii) of the European Charter, cannot be considered as a
regional or minority language.

In sum, Darija is not at present considered a Spanish or European regional or minority
language, all the more so because, as shall be explained in greater detail below, in the
specific territory of the Autonomous City of Ceuta it is not in any way endangered.

c. Current situation and historic presence of Arabic (Darija) in Ceuta.

In this regard, it must be made clear beforehand that due to the personal nature of the
respective data regarding this question, it is not possible to obtain overly precise sources;
172

it is nevertheless appropriate to put forward some arguments and considerations on the
question at hand.

Regarding the current situation, it must first be stated that most of the Europeans are
monolingual, while the Muslims possess varying degrees of bilingualism. The varied
degrees of bilingualism in Ceuta accentuate the complexity of studying the socio-cultural
variants affecting same. The degree of characterisation of a bilingual speaker therefore
depends on a number of variables ranging from the psychological (including at cognitive
and psycho-linguistic levels) to the social, socio-cultural or socio-linguistic. In Ceuta it is as
easy to hear a phrase in Spanish as another in Darija, given that the latter dialect of Arabic
is the mother tongue of a large segment of the population – in the children’s age groups it
may reach 65% of the total population.

Using ethnic characteristics, two sociolects or ethnolects can be distinguished within
Ceutan speech: first there is Castilian Spanish which is the non-exclusive speech of the
Europeans (which may also include members of the Jewish culture and almost all the
Hindus) and, second, Darija Arabic, which is an Arabic dialect (pertaining to the Maghreb
type) with features of its own from the speech used in the mountains of northern Morocco
and with a large number of Hispanic influences in its lexical heritage. Darija presents
diatopic differences in the city – important differences can be established between the
Ceutan Arabic of Benzú (more rural and socially less valued) and that of the Príncipe
Alfonso district or the Recinto Sur area, for example. Ceutan Arabic is also undergoing the
simplification of features of rural origin, while at the same time the already numerous
Hispanic expressions are increasing. In the city it is thus possible to find people whose
way of speaking proceeds from other regions such as Rif and Sus, though in fewer
numbers than that of Darija.

Spanish and Ceutan Arabic are thus the two languages in contact in the city of Ceuta,
which counts a high percentage of bilingual individuals, who:

a) Possess two language systems;
b) Keep the two systems separate, although there is interference;
c) Can switch (and do so continually) systems quickly and with no effort;
d) Are able to translate a message from one language to the other.
173

On the other hand, in the current socio-linguistic context, the bilingualism of some of the
speakers is characterised as subtractive or loss-related, whereby the degree of skill with
the Spanish language is in detriment to Ceutan Arabic (it must also be kept in mind that
the dominance and use of the languages is not the same, nor is it as intense in all cases).
Besides the subtractive nature, Ceutan bilingualism can be defined as being as affiliated or
early, bicultural (there is a double cultural identity), secondary (the second language is
learned in academic institutions) and on many occasions, balanced.

According to the usage contexts examined, it is clearly observed that there is a social and
contextual conditioning which governs use of the languages; for this reason, one may
speak of diglossia in Ceuta. That is, in the Ceutan context, where there is a prestigious
variety (the Spanish language) and another with less prestige (Darija), the situation of
contact of languages in Ceuta may be considered as diglossic or, more precisely, doubly
diglossic.

According to the traditional concept of diglossia (Ferguson, 1996), classical Arabic (al‘arabiyyah al-fus-ha) is thus the old variety with a literary tradition, grammatically more
complex and used for elevated purposes, while the vernacular Arabic (Ceutan Darija) is
used in the family context, on the street, etc. In the particular case of Ceuta this first
diglossia is more theoretical than practical, as classical Arabic is an unknown language for
not a few bilingual Ceutans. With respect to the second diglossia, it occurs when Spanish
is used as official language and Arabic as family language.

As for the repercussions of the languages’ contact, certain linguistic phenomena can be
cited, such as interference, transfer, loan and code-switching, etc, which depend on
factors such as the speaker’s skill level. These are linguistic mechanisms which try to
resolve the gaps produced in either of the languages in contact, not only due to ignorance,
but also to suit the communication circumstances.

Moreover, code switching (code mixing is also commonly used) has arisen in a new
linguistic and cultural communication system (institutionalised code) for a large part of the
bilingual population, which thereby attempts to consolidate an identity of its own. This
phenomenon is observed and documented more clearly among the young population,
although it must be pointed out that many code switching cases are labelled “language
mixing” or “speech mixing” by the speakers themselves and by the monolingual
174

inhabitants. By means of this communication strategy, common in border areas, Ceuta’s
bilingual citizens are situated as a collective different from both the non-Muslim Spaniards
and the Muslim Moroccans. As a logical consequence of the multicultural, multiethnic and
multilingual coexistence characteristic of border areas, code switching thus becomes a
code which marks and reinforces identity.

In code switching, the languages in contact do not participate to the same extent within the
communicative process to refer to the morpho-syntactic framework in which a bilingual
enunciation is included. In Ceuta’s case, the enunciations and communicative intentions
and situations are so varied that it is hard to make generalisations, although in most of the
linguistic productions analysed it may be concluded that Arabic functions as mother
tongue.

In any case, it is worth recalling that language switching at all these levels can only be
produced if the speaker dominates both languages equally. The monolingual population of
Ceuta has therefore traditionally considered that language switching shows deficiencies in
both the Arabic dialect and the Spanish language.

Regarding the question of whether or not there has been a traditional presence of Arabic
in Ceuta, only in recent times could a growing presence of Darija be observed,
corresponding to growth of the population of Maghrebi origin for whom the dialect is their
mother tongue. To wit, in 1970, the population of Maghrebi origin was no more than 10%
while it is currently more than 40%.

The above considerations with respect to the language’s current situation and its almost
exclusive use by the population of Maghrebi origin, along with the noted evolution of this
population, is what enables the assertion that there is a clear and direct association
between the arrival and presence of Darija and the arrival and presence of the population
of Maghrebi origin. It may consequently be concluded that the presence of that dialect is
not traditional but rather the result of a relatively recent and very numerous influx of people
from another country.

To finish this introductory part, various conclusions can be drawn from the above
information and considerations: first of all, Darija cannot be considered a regional or
minority language according to the current legal concept for same set out in the European
175

Charter and in the respective declaration by the Kingdom of Spain; second, it is not a
language which geographically and humanly contextualised (with extensive local
implantation, of foreign origin and ongoing numerical growth) can be considered
endangered; and third and last, it is not strictly a language with a traditional or historical
presence in Ceuta, but rather as recent as the influx of immigrants of Maghrebi origin.

Despite this, based on the information obtained and on a merely informative basis, two
aspects with respect to article 7 of the Charter are detailed below.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

According to information supplied by the Local Ministry of Education, Culture and Women
of the City of Ceuta (local administration), Darija, Sindhi and Hebrew are recognised in
Ceuta on 21 February of each year in an act in which the city commemorates the mother
tongues of migrants to Ceuta.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

According to information supplied by the Local Ministry of Education, Culture and Women
of the City of Ceuta (local administration), the following stand out among the actions
undertaken by the City of Ceuta with respect to application of the Charter, vis-à-vis the
teaching and study of Arabic:
1ª. Arabic courses in the Continuing Education Plan of the City of Ceuta addressed to
personnel who provide services in same. During the last four years two Arabic courses
have been offered per year (level 1 and level 2), with 20 students per course, each
lasting 80 hours, for a total of 160 participants;
2ª. Arabic courses at the Language Institute of the City of Ceuta;
3ª. Arabic courses are also offered at the Official Language School of the Education
Ministry in Ceuta. Figures provided by that Ministry’s Provincial Directorate in Ceuta
indicate that in academic year 2009-2010 the following levels of Arabic are offered, with
the corresponding students and teachers, as shown:

2.8. TAMAZIGHT IN MELILLA

To report on this language the Government of the City of Melilla (local administration), the
Institute of Cultures (local administration) and the Government Delegation in the City of
Melilla (state administration) were consulted.
INTRODUCTION

a) Population structure of the City of Melilla.
No complete figures on Melilla’s population are available, although according to
information supplied by the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizens Participation
of the City of Melilla, the number of Melillan Tamazight speakers, at their various levels,
may be over 20,000 people. For its part, the Government Delegation in Melilla (state
administration) indicates that the Tamazight-speaking population in Melilla accounts for
40% of the total, i.e., around 35,000 people, and that it is the language of 60% of the
primary school population.

b) Is Tamazight a regional or minority language?
According to the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizens Participation and the
Government Delegation in Melilla there is no traditional presence of Arabic in Melilla,
as the Tamazight language pertaining to the Berbers is what a significant sector of the
Melillan population speaks, corresponding to the Maghrebi-origin population who
immigrated in recent years to the city.
c. Current situation and historic presence of Tamazight in Melilla.
The Tamazight language is a Hamitic-Semitic (or Afro-Asiatic) language with phonetic
and morphological similarities with the Semitic languages (such as Hebrew or Arabic)
but very different in lexical aspects and the morphemes used.

The Tamazight language is generally non-literate, not standardised and not official, neither
in Morocco nor in Melilla (which does not prevent its written use in some Moroccan
periodicals such as TWIZA, which is published in French, Arabic and Tamazight using
Latin characters). Despite this, the Imazighen have always learned aurally and speak
absolutely naturally.
178

The Imazighen are the native pre-Phoenician inhabitants of North Africa before the 7th
century Arab expansion through the area. Their territory ranged from the Canary Islands
and Atlantic Ocean to the western bounds of Egypt, and from the Mediterranean in the
north to the Senegal and Niger Rivers and Tibesti Massif in the south. This vast
geographical area is nowadays inhabited by people who speak Tamazight and Arabic
(considered Tamazight population linguistically Arabicised). The total number of Tamazight
speakers has been calculated to be around 20 million: up to 50% of the Moroccans, 30%
of the Algerians and 2% of the Tunisians. To this list we may add Spain, where more than
40% of the Spaniards in the city of Melilla are Imazighen.

The historic intent of these countries has been to coordinate a homogeneous reality
around the signs of identity of the Arabic language.

The four factors indicated (remote antiquity, large geographic extent, co-existence with
other languages as official languages and absence of standards) have resulted in
Tamazight branching into distinct regional variants. The one which interests us in the case
of Melilla is that spoken in the north: Tamazight Tarifit (Rifian), spoken by more than 2
million people in northern Morocco. It is the language of the Rif Mountains, Melilla and the
surrounding area. It must be noted that this is the area which has given the most
immigrants to Europe. More specifically, the speech of the area of Melilla and Nador
(Kelaya region) is Taqer’act. (Tilmantine et al., 1998).

In Melilla the situation of Tamazight with respect to Spanish is quite similar to what it has
experienced with Arabic in other territories. It was the language of those who populated
the territory before it became part of the Kingdom of Spain and, as in the Moroccan
environment of Melilla, it was maintained for periods alongside Spanish as the language of
domestic and daily use by the population of Imazighen origin. The documental
regularisation process begun in 1986 led the Melillan population of Rifian origin to acquire
Spanish nationality; the Imazighen of Melilla thus became full-fledged Spanish citizens
with their own language and traditions.

Although there are no official figures, according to different estimates, and as indicated
above, the Tamazight-speaking population of Melilla is more than 40% of the total, i.e., we
can put it at about 35,000 people; it is the language of 60% of the primary school
179

population. Despite the widespread presence of Tamazight in the city, Melilla’s sociolinguistic situation cannot be defined as “bilingual” but rather as “diglossic”, i.e., the
Castilian language occupies the place of official language and is what is used in the news
media, academic contexts and in administration. The Tamazight language is not official, its
written codification is limited to the intellectual context of studying the language, its use is
limited to family and interpersonal relationships and it is almost exclusively used orally.

The profile of Melilla’s Tamazight-speaking population is of Imazighen origin. Although
there is no statistical data broken down by cultures of origin, it can be inferred that in city
districts with higher concentrations of Imazighen-origin population the birth and growth
rates are substantially higher than those of the population originating in Peninsular Spain;
it is therefore a population younger than the average in Melilla. These zones also
concentrate higher rates of joblessness and lower levels of education and income.

To finish this introductory section, various conclusions can be drawn from the above data
and considerations: in first place, Tamazight cannot be considered a regional or minority
language according to the current legal concept for same set out in the European Charter
and in the respective declaration by the Kingdom of Spain; second, it is not a language
which geographically and humanly contextualised (with extensive local implantation, of
foreign origin and ongoing numerical growth) can be considered endangered; and third
and last, it is not strictly a language with a traditional or historical presence in Melilla,
without prejudicing the antecedents before incorporation into the Kingdom of Spain, but
rather its current use derives from the significant influx of Maghrebi immigrants in the last
three decades who use this exogenous language.

Despite this, based on the information obtained and on a merely informative basis,
reference will be made below to two aspects associated to article 7 of the Charter.

THE RECOGNITION OF THE REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AS AN
EXPRESSION OF CULTURAL WEALTH

180

Although Tamazight is not expressly mentioned in the Statute of Autonomy of Melilla, it
can be deemed to be implicitly considered in point 2 (h) of article 5 of Organic Law 2/1995
of 13 March, on the Statute of Autonomy of Melilla, which reads as follows:

“The institutions of the city of Melilla, within the framework of their responsibilities, shall
exercise their powers with the following basic objectives:
h) The promotion and encouragement of the values of understanding, respect and
appreciation of the cultural and linguistic plurality of the Melillan population”.

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

The Permanent Seminar on Tamazight Language and Culture was recently established
and is integrated in the Institute of the Cultures of the Autonomous City of Melilla, an
autonomous body attached to the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizen
Participation.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE
STAGES;

According to information supplied by the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizen
Participation, the following stand out among the actions the City of Melilla has taken with
respect to the teaching and study of Tamazight:

The aforementioned creation of the Permanent Seminar on Tamazight Language and
Culture is integrated in the Institute of the Cultures of the Autonomous City of Melilla, an
autonomous body attached to the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizen
Participation. This seminar has for years been offering classes in the Tamazight language
used by the Berbers of Melilla, during the period coinciding with the academic year. Also,
in 2009 an intensive 30-hour course was offered in collaboration with the University of
Granada, which will be continued in coming years in both cases, with the possibility of
academic recognition of credits of free configuration by that university. Beyond enabling
181

citizens who know that language to improve their knowledge of same, such activities also
provide measures for non-speakers to learn it.

With the same goal, the Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizen Participation has
been working with the Institute and the National University of Distance Education to offer
the teaching of Tamazight at the University Centre for Distance Language learning (CUID),
which will involve the provision of appropriate means for teaching and study at all levels.

Lastly, local and state administration is financing multimedia courses for learning
Tamazight

(elementary,

intermediate

and

advanced

levels)

on

the

website

www.melillatamazight.es.

The provision of facilities enabling non-speakers of a regional or minority language
living in the area where it is used to learn it if they so desire

The Local Ministry of the Presidency and Citizen Participation highlights the following
among the actions the City of Melilla has undertaken with respect to this section:

-

Tamazight training courses for civil servants (local and state);

-

Trainer training course in Tamazight language, taught in December 2009; will
continue in coming years.

THE PROMOTION OF STUDY AND RESEARCH ON REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES AT UNIVERSITIES OR EQUIVALENT INSTITUTIONS

The award of research grants by the Institute of the Cultures is planned in the near future;
Tamazight is one of the areas of investigation. Plans also call for the creation of a
“Research Centre for the Tamazight Language and Culture” within the Institute of the
Cultures.

As for the other objectives and principles set out in article 7 of the European Charter for
Regional or Minority Languages, no relevant information is noted.

182

2.9. ROMANI AND CALÓ (WITHOUT TERRITORY)

To report on these languages the Ministries of Culture and Education (state
administration), the Governments of the Autonomous Communities with a significant
presence of Roma populations (regional administration), the Roma Culture Institute (public
foundation created by the Ministry of Culture), the State Council of the Roma People
(linked to the state administration) and the Fundación Secretariado Gitano/FGS (private
NGO) were consulted.

INTRODUCTION
The Roma community has been present in our country since the early 15th century. At
present, it is calculated that the Spanish Roma population comprises around 650,000
people. The Autonomous Community with the most Roma is Andalusia (with a population
estimated at 270,000), followed by other Autonomous Communities such as Catalonia
(80,000), Madrid (60,000), the Valencian Community (estimated at 52,000) and
Extremadura.

The Spanish Roma population is very young compared to the non-Roma population. Some
45% are under 16 years old and the birth rate is 64 per thousand, while that of the nonRoma population is 14 per thousand. In recent times a gradual decline in the birth rate and
number of children per family has been occurring. The average marriage age is rising,
although it is lower than that of non-Roma. For female Roma that age is 16-20 years old;
for male Roma it is 18-22 years old.

The Roma population’s education level is now lower than any other social group of similar
size and composition. Few Roma from the older generations have regularly attended
school; a high percentage of Roma more than 18 years old have a level of total and/or
very high functional illiteracy (according to a recent FSG study, about 70% of Roma over
16 years old do not have the obligatory basic studies). Illiteracy is even greater among
women. Despite this, the FSG study titled “Evaluation of Educational Normalisation of
Roma Students in Primary Education” indicates that the enrolment of Roma children in
school has become widespread throughout the country (94% of Roma children attend
school at 6 years old or earlier).
183

Given the lack of updated demographic or linguistic studies about the Spanish Roma
population, the current situation of the Romani and Kale in Spain can only be portrayed
along general lines, without including numerical data, which are unknown:

-

Practically the entire Roma population resident in Spain speaks Castilian;

-

In the Autonomous Communities where there are regional languages, many Roma are
bilingual in Castilian and the corresponding regional language. The specific situation
varies from one region to another depending on the regional language’s prevalence;

-

A dialectal variant of Romani called Caló has traditionally existed in Spain, although
some Spanish Roma communities (mainly residing in both Castiles), have historically
also called it “Romanó”;

-

Caló is recognised by most Spanish Roma as the community’s own language.
Although its use is limited to increasingly reduced contexts (family, family celebrations,
social interactions with other members of the respective community, etc), it is no less
certain that it is still strongly valued as an emotional and identity-related reference;

-

Use of Caló is more frequent among people over 40 years old, although young people
also use it, even on the Internet (chatting, social networks);

-

Given that Caló is a mixed speech which arose in Spain, interaction with languages in
the surrounding area has led to distinct variants of Caló, among which the general
Spanish Caló and Catalan Caló are the ones that have received the most attention by
scholars;

-

In Spain there is also a variant of Caló strongly influenced by Basque called
Erromintxela. It is used by a part of the Roma population residing in the Autonomous
Community of the Basque Country, who also call themselves Erromintxela;

-

Romani strictly speaking is spoken in Spain by about 30,000 people above all from
Romania, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Macedonia, therefore not Spanish citizens. Most of
these people are trilingual;

-

In recent years there has been growing interest by young Spanish Roma activists in
learning Romani, to the point that in Spain there may currently be around a thousand
Romani speakers scattered throughout the national geography. The participation of
these young people in international activities (where they have been able to gain
firsthand knowledge of this language’s linguistic reality) or in the Filadelfia Evangelical
Church (to which a large portion of the Spanish and foreign Roma population belong
(many Romanian and Bulgarian Roma worship with Spanish Roma) and within which
184

international exchanges are also promoted) have been the main incentive behind the
interest in Romani in Spain.

The recognition of the regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural
wealth

At state level the following milestones stand out with respect to the recognition of Roma
culture:
•

Creation of the State Council of the Roma People (Royal Decree 891/2005 of 22 July)
as an inter-ministerial collegiate consultative and advisory body, which institutionalises
cooperation between the Roma associative movement and the General State
Administration, for the development of social welfare policies based on the integral
promotion and development of the Roma population;

•

Approval by the Chamber of Deputies of a non-binding proposition on 27 September
2005 whereby the government was urged to promote the culture, history, identity and
language of the Roma population;

•

Creation of the Institute of Roma Culture (2007) by the Ministry of Culture as a
foundation with the aim of developing and promoting the history, culture and language
of the Roma and their recognition as an integral part of Spanish culture;

•

Creation of the Council for the Promotion of Equal Treatment and Non-Discrimination
(Royal Decree 1262/2007 of 21 September, regulating the composition, responsibilities
and system of functioning); and the change of affiliation of this body to the Directorate
General against Discrimination of the Ministry of Equality (Royal Decree 1135/2008 of
4 July). Said Council’s aim is to promote the principle of equal treatment and nondiscrimination of people due to their racial or ethnic origin in very diverse contexts
(education, health, social services, housing, job access, etc).

At regional level the following milestones stand out with respect to the recognition of Roma
culture:
•

Resolution 105/VI, following on non-binding Proposition 255/VI (PNL-280) of 9
November 2006, whereby the Junta of Extremadura is urged to enhance recognition of
Roma culture and its value for Extremaduran society, and to prevent and identify
discriminatory practices due to racial or ethnic origin, whereby the Assembly of
Extremadura urges the Junta of Extremadura to enhance recognition of Roma culture
185

and its value for Extramaduran society, so that this recognition of their culture and
value is accomplished via policies consistent with the development of the Roma
people, preventing and identifying practices which discriminate due to racial or ethnic
origin, and to place at the service of intercultural society the recognition of the identity
of the Roma people;
•

Decree of the Junta of Extremadura 179/2001 of 20 November, establishing the
Regional Council for the Roma Community as a collegiate and participatory body in
matters of the real equality of the Roma collective;

•

Creation of the Board for the Integration and Promotion of the Roma People of the
Community of Madrid;

•

Creation of the Council for the Integral Promotion and Social Participation of the Roma
People in the Basque Country (Decree 289/2003 of 25 November).

THE NEED FOR RESOLUTE ACTION TO PROMOTE REGIONAL OR MINORITY
LANGUAGES IN ORDER TO SAFEGUARD THEM

At state level the following actions to promote Roma culture stand out:

A translation of the Spanish Constitution has been published in Romanó-Caló, as well
as a large number of articles in the periodical “Nevipens Romaní”, various Caló
dictionaries, some Biblical translations and several translations of national and
international legal texts;
Several didactic works have been disseminated, whose impact has been very limited
due to the lack of structures and teachers;
Some initiatives by Roma NGOs have enabled introductory Romanó courses to be
offered, taught in different places in Spain;
Romani awareness activities have been carried out (conferences, articles, etc);
Widespread Internet access has enabled a growing number of young Spanish Roma to
have contact with Romani in its various forms, particularly via music;
The Ministry of Education and the Fundación Secretariado Gitano signed a
collaboration agreement for the 2005-2009 period covering various actions meant to
boost the knowledge and dissemination of Roma culture, including: to undertake and
disseminate actions and materials associated to this population and to work together to
186

develop actions addressed to this collective and to prevent school truancy;
Regarding dissemination of the Romani language and Caló, the Ministry of Education
published in 2003, via the Education Commission of the Development Programme for
the Roma People, an educational CD on the Roma people and their culture called
“MAJ KHETANE” (closer together). This material is arranged in seven sections: history,
culture, story, comics, conversations, activities and appendices. It must be stressed
that the comics are based on scenes from the real life of Roma and that the characters
and narration of same have the option of being heard in the international language of
the Roma, Romani, and with the lexicon used by the Spanish Roma, Caló. In 2008 the
document on the Roma Development Programme was published in Romani;
For its part, the Roma Culture Institute has carried out the following actions:
•

Project Sar san (How are you?) One of the priority goals is to raise awareness that
Romani is an important part of the cultural heritage of all the world’s Roma and also
all the Spanish. The linguistic team of the Roma Culture Institute began in 2007 a
48-page pilot exercise book as a publishing advance. Sar San? is a globally
pioneering publication, as in other countries courses have been published which do
not deal specifically with standard Romani. In 2008 the project’s general design was
undertaken and the contracting completed;

•

The colours in school. This project began in 2007 with publication of a first didactic
primary unit on “romipen” (Roma culture). In 2008 an exercise book was published
for the third cycle of primary school, forming part of the curricular areas of language,
knowledge of the environment and English. The first notebook has already been
reprinted. In 2009 a third small exercise book was produced for secondary school
students;

•

Cuadernos Gitanos. This is the reference publication of the Institute of Roma
Culture. As in previous years, in 2009 plans called for two issues (nos. 4 and 5), to
be published in June and November, respectively. Issue no. 4 would include the CD
“Roma Singer-Songwriters”, which began to be recorded in 2008. To extend its
distribution in libraries and universities, membership in the Spanish Association of
Cultural Magazines (ARCE) will be requested and contacts made with the
Cervantes Institute to assure its international dissemination;

•

José Heredia Maya poetry anthology. The poet and playwright José Heredia Maya
was awarded the Roma Culture Prize in 2008 in the literature modality. His
important poetic work (currently dispersed in different editions) will be gathered into
187

a single edition which will count collaboration from the Institute of Roma Culture.
Contacts have been made with several publishers with a view to co-publishing the
book;
•

Videos. Plans call for various videos summarising the activities to be made, to be
shown during presentations by the Institute of Roma Culture in different
Autonomous Communities and in the acts, symposia and courses in which the
Institute participates. The audiovisual material can be viewed and downloaded from
the Institute’s website. The envisaged projects include production of a documentary
on the honorary doctorate awarded by the University of Cadiz to Don Juan de Dios
Ramírez Heredia, the first Roma distinguished with this important academic
recognition;

•

Roma Documentation Centre. Since financial year 2007 efforts have been made to
compile documentary material – bibliographies, films, photographs, recordings, etc,
associated to Roma history and culture. In 2009 a four-year development plan and
a strategy plan were implemented with a view to setting up a documentation centre
based on the new technologies. The work begun in 2008 to compile and digitalise
old photographs from private donations will likewise continue in order to create a
graphic archive that reflects the daily life and historic memory of Spanish Roma in
the 20th century;

•

Library of the Roma People. Efforts to purchase, catalogue and archive books
continue. Plans call for the Library of the Roma People to open in the spring of
2010;

•

Website. The Foundation Institute of Roma Culture has created a website with
various goals: to compile the Roma historic memory, provide information about the
current and future situation of the Institute and to offer training.

At regional level the following actions to promote Roma culture stand out:

The Regional Council for the Roma Community of Extremadura, a collegiate and
participative body in matters affecting the real equality of the Roma collective, as a
result of consensus between Roma organisations and the administration, unanimously
approved at its 1 March 2007 session the Extremaduran plan for the social participation
and promotion of the Roma People, to be in effect until 2012. The plan covers the
activities and initiatives undertaken in the areas of culture, education and social
188

participation;
The Generalitat [Government] of Catalonia envisaged in the framework of the 20052008 Integral Plan for the Roma People, among others, actions with respect to the
Romani language and culture. This plan can be consulted in Romani and in Catalan,
Castilian

and

English,

at

http://www.gencat.cat/governacio-

ap/ACCIO_CIUTADANA/DOCS-FORMULARIS/Pla_poble_gitano.pdf.

The aim of the Plan is the integration and cohesion of the Roma people. Among the
measures it contains, and precisely as an instrument of social cohesion, are those
associated to the language – those which guarantee access to training in the host
language, Catalan, and those associated to the promotion of their language of origin. It
must be kept in mind that although Romani is a language with a broad social base in
Europe, in Catalonia very few are familiar with it, even in the Roma community.

Given this situation of practical disappearance of the Caló-Romani language in
Catalonia, the action taken by the Generalitat of Catalonia has not been to educate
students but rather to train future educators, so the effort has fundamentally been
addressed to more participative elements of the Roma community, thereby attracting
strongly motivated candidates. With this aim, training action has been carried out with
the following goals:
•

recovery of the Romani language;

•

awareness of the right of linguistic difference;

•

creation of a network to disseminate the Romani language;

•

training offered to educators to exponentially increase the future provision of
Romani teaching.

This planning led to the holding in 2008 of the first standard Romani course, Rromani
Skòla, in 32 3-hour sessions for a total of 96 training hours. Backed by the Integral Plan
for the Roma People corresponding to the 2009-2013 three-year period, and given the
success of the aforementioned first Romani course, plans were made to offer it a
second time in 2009.

The Generalitat of Catalonia also collaborated on publishing the textbook put out by the
“Lacho Baji Cali” Roma Association, Curs de Romaní”, by Prof. Alexandre Queraltó.
189

This manual serves as the basis for the class taught by its author, who teaches the
Kalderash variant of Romani. The course consists of an hour-and-a-half per week and
is taught in the classrooms of the Faculty of Philology of the University of Barcelona.
This is the first course which offers in Spanish (and Catalan) a very complete
description of the Kalderash dialect.

On the other hand, and complementing the linguistic training in Romani language,
various actions have been undertaken to disseminate this language, among which we
highlight the round table held on the International Day of the Roma People with the
theme topic of “The Roma language in Catalonia and the world”. It dealt with the sociolinguistic situation of Romani in Catalonia, Spain and the international context, as well
as its condition as an element of social cohesion and supranational and transnational
identity for the Roma people.

Lastly, note that since 2006 various studies, websites, plans and books have been
translated into Romani to promote the dissemination and use of that language. The
translated documents include the following:
•

First integral plan for the Roma people in Catalonia 2005-2008;

•

Second integral plan for the Roma people in Catalonia 2009-2013;

•

Webpage of the European project ROMAin: social inclusion policies in Europe with
the Roma people;

•

Guide to good practices for the social inclusion of the Roma people in Europe,
resulting from the European project ROMAin. Available for consultation at
http://www.romainclusion.org/rcs_gene/311-384_Guia_romani96.pdf;

•

Publication of “Curs de Romaní”.

THE FACILITATION AND/OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE USE OF REGIONAL OR
MINORITY LANGUAGES, IN SPEECH AND WRITING, IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE

In the framework of its annual award of subsidies for the publication of cultural magazines,
the Ministry of Culture has been granting subsidies to the magazines “Revista Gitanos.
Pensamiento y Cultura” and “Revista O TCHATCHIPEN (La verdad)”, albeit only the latter

190

includes copies in Romani language. In the 2006-2008 period these magazines were
granted subsidies worth €31,050.

THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE FORMS AND MEANS FOR THE TEACHING AND
STUDY OF REGIONAL OR MINORITY LANGUAGES AT ALL APPROPRIATE STAGES

On 22 December 2008 the call for projects involving integral social intervention to meet the
needs of the Roma population and enhance the Roma people’s development was
published in Extremadura. This line of assistance aims to finance the implementation of
integral and specific projects focusing on areas deemed to be priorities such as education,
jobs and health, etc, with the goal of achieving full social integration of the Roma
collective, especially those covered by the fundamentals and priorities set out in the
Extremaduran plan for the social participation and promotion of the Roma people.

In determining their policy with regard to regional or minority languages, the Parties
shall take into consideration the needs and wishes expressed by the groups which
use such languages. They are encouraged to establish bodies, if necessary, for the
purpose of advising the authorities on all matters pertaining to regional or minority
languages

At state level the following aforementioned participative and advisory bodies for the Roma
communities stand out:
•

The State Council for the Roma People (Royal Decree 891/2005 of 22 July);

•

The Institute of Roma Culture (2007);

HEBREW LANGUAGES

To report on these languages the Superior Centre for Scientific Research (state
administration) and the Casa Sefarad Israel (private foundation) were consulted. The latter
in turn consulted the Jewish community in Madrid and the Federation of Jewish
Communities in Spain.

Among other aspects, the aim of the information provided in this point of the report is to
answer the question put forward by the Committee of Experts about “whether Yiddish is
present in Spain, asking the authorities to ascertain this in cooperation with the speakers”.

a. Population structure of the Spanish Jewish community
Until the 15th century a numerous Jewish community coexisted in Spain, whose presence
dated to the 7th century B.C. In the late 15th century, specifically in 1492, the Catholic
Monarchs [Ferdinand and Isabel] issued the Alhambra Decree ordering the Spanish Jews
to convert to Christianity or definitively leave the territory within three months. Spain went
from having a 10% Jewish population to becoming the only European country without
Jews.

Most of this Sephardic population (around 600,000 people) chose exile and scattered to
various countries. In Western Europe some settled in southern France, the Netherlands,
northern Germany, Switzerland and Italy. Others spread to the kingdoms of Morocco and
Syria. Still others remained in Spain as nominal Christians and later moved to Iberian
America where they recovered their Jewish identity.

However, the far majority of the Sephardic Jews were absorbed by the Ottoman Empire,
which promoted the settlement of Jews in all domains of its Empire, with the largest
number settling in the city of Salonika.

The city of Salonika in Greek Macedonia changed significantly after receiving nearly
250,000 Jews expelled from Spain. Towards the end of the 19th century nearly 65% of the
port city’s population comprised Sephardic Jews. From the start most of the Jews from
Galicia, Andalusia, Aragon, Sicily and Naples settled in this city; for this reason the
193

Salonikan Judeo-Spanish was clearly influenced by the grammar of Galician and borrowed
numerous words from Italian. In Salonika there were neighbourhoods, communities and
synagogues corresponding to each of the cities and regions of Spain. Kal de Kastiya, Kal
Aragon, Otranto, Palma, Sicilia, Kasseres, Kuriat, Albukerk, Evora and Kal Portugal are
examples of late 19th century neighbourhoods and synagogues in the Macedonian city and
show that the Sephardic Jews never forgot their past or their Iberian origins.

When Greece became independent, Greek nationalism and especially the Second World
War led to a sharp decline in the Sephardic community. Many of its members either
dispersed around the world, emigrating to countries such as Argentina, Brazil and China,
or died as victims of the Holocaust.

The reduced Sephardic community is nowadays especially concentrated in Israel, where
Sephardic communities exist in the cities of Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem. They have their
own representation in the Knesset; the Sephardic religious party Shas is one of the main
political forces in Israel and the most numerous “confessional” force.

The destruction of almost the entire Sephardic community in the Holocaust is largely
responsible for the substantial decline in the population of Judeo-Spanish speakers. This
led many members of the Sephardic community, mainly living in America and Israel, to try
to preserve the language, to institutionalise it and promote pertinent scientific and cultural
activities.
Regarding the Jewish population’s situation in Spain, since the 20th century a Jewish
population has once again been present, putting an end to that prolonged historical
demographic absence. The recent World Jewish Congress indicated that “the large
majority of Jews in Spain are now Spanish, with second and third generations”; the same
report states that “the Jews say they feel well integrated in a society with little antiSemitism”. There are no sufficiently broken down figures on the current size of the Jewish
community in Spain. Information provided by the Ministry of Justice, responsible for
relations with the distinct religious confessions, indicates that in Spain there are around
45,000 Jews at present, most from North Africa and the Middle East – most are Sephardic
Jews, though there are also Ashkenazi from Europe and America. According to other
sources, the number of Jews in Spain is lower – 30,000. The profile of the current Spanish
Jew is predominantly urban (mainly Madrid and Barcelona, although they are present in
194

ten other Spanish cities, such as Ceuta, for example, which holds an event to
commemorate the Sephardic language every 21 February), with a gradual decline of the
pre-school population.

The 1978 Spanish democratic Constitution supports religious freedom. That liberty is also
guaranteed with respect to the offence considered in article 510 of the Criminal Code,
concerning the fight against “discrimination, hate and violence against groups or
associations, for racist, anti-Semitic or other reasons...”.

For his part, King Juan Carlos I formally revoked the Alhambra Decree. Moreover, since
1982 Spain has recognised the nationality of Sephardic Jews who show a clear link to the
country. Nationalisations are processed on an exceptional basis through a Council of
Ministers Agreement.

b. Is Yiddish traditionally present in Spain?

In Spain, the language used by the Sepharic Jews was Judeo-Spanish, also known as
Sephardic or Ladino. This language, although primarily derived from Castilian, is a mix in
different proportions of many of the languages spoken in the Iberian Peninsula and in
Aragon’s Mediterranean possessions. Being a Jewish language, it does contain
contributions from Hebrew and depending on where it is spoken a strong influence is
noted of Turkish and principally Greek. The Judeo-Spanish spoken by the Sephardic Jews
in the 20th century also shows a rich influx of French vocabulary.

Regarding the current situation of Judeo-Spanish or Sephardic in Spain, the Sephardic
Studies Group of the Spanish National Research Council [CSIC] has indicated that it is
nowadays an endangered language in countries where it is still spoken (Bulgaria, Greece,
Turkey, Bosnia and Israel), among which Spain is not included. It is difficult to find
Sephardic speakers below 50 years old. The CSIC’s research work has focused on
publishing hundreds of works written in that language from the 16th century up to the
Second World War, with a view to integrating that literature, written in a language deriving
from medieval Hispanic tongues, within the framework of Hispanic letters.

As for those who know Yiddish in Spain, most are of Argentine origin and are fully
integrated in two of the country’s official languages: Castilian, official language of the state
195

(all); and Catalan, co-official language in Catalonia (those residing in the Autonomous
Community of Catalonia).

For its part, according to data from the Jewish Community of Madrid and the Federation of
Jewish Communities of Spain, Casa Sefarad-Israel indicates that both languages
(Sephardic and Yiddish) are linked to the establishment of Jewish communities in Spain, of
both Sephardic and Ashkenazi origin. One may speak of important migratory waves, one
which began in the 1950s, of communities from northern Morocco, and another of
Argentine Jews in the 1960s. These are the main ones and they are two very different
cultural groups. The former are of Sephardic culture and the latter Ashkenazi.

The Moroccans spoke Judeo-Spanish until the Spanish Protectorate was established in
northern Morocco, after which they assimilated and updated their Spanish; this was not a
sudden occurrence but rather a natural evolution and a return to the longed-for Spain.

At present very few people in Spain speak Judeo-Spanish as a different language, though
it is a cultural reference and source for folklore and idiomatic expressions. The National
Radio offers a programme in Judeo-Spanish. The Ashkenazi group stopped speaking
Yiddish in Hispano-America; the Argentine Jews who arrive in Spain already speak
Spanish as mother tongue and can barely speak Yiddish. Yiddish is nowadays spoken in
Spain in small family circles of Ashkenazi Jews from Argentina. A group has been created
in Madrid to speak the language, so that even though it is not a language for creation or
dialogue in Spain, a certain amount of cultural interest in this language has been raised.

196

2.11

OTHER LANGUAGES

Below are included some short references to other regional or minority languages in
Spain.

Mozarabic

Mozarabic was a Hispanic language constituted by distinct Romance dialects written in
the Arabic alphabet instead of the Latin alphabet, and spoken and written by Christian
residents when the south of the peninsula was ruled by the Muslims in the Middle Ages.
After the Christians re-conquered the peninsula this collective maintained its particular
idiosyncrasy. At present the institution for Mozarabs in Spain comprises about 2,000
families (mainly located in the city of Toledo), who have jealously guarded their rites and
vocabulary, mainly religious, for more than nine centuries.

Cantabrian

Cantabrian (cántabru or montañés) is a group of native language varieties from Cantabria
and especially those most differing from standard Spanish. Depending on various criteria,
Cantabrian can encompass speech varieties from various parts of Cantabria and also from
border areas of Vizcaya as well as nearby mountain comarcas [administrative regions] of
the provinces of Burgos and Palencia. According to the thesis of Francisco García
González, the Asturian varieties in the concejos [municipalities] of Peñamellera Alta,
Peñamellera Baja and Ribadedeva should also be included.

Cantabrian is a Romance dialect which evolved directly from Latin, whose development
led it to be included in the Astur-Leonese linguistic diasystem along with Mirandese,
Asturian and Leonese. In 2009 it was mentioned in the UNESCO red book of endangered
languages in the Astur-Leonese trunk as a language with clear risk of extinction.

Sign languages

Law 27/2007 of 23 October, which recognises the Spanish sign languages and regulates
the means of supporting the oral communication of people who are deaf, hearing impaired
or deaf and blind, aims to recognise and regulate the Spanish sign languages (Spanish
197

and Catalan) as the language of people who are deaf, hearing impaired or deaf and blind
in Spain who freely decide to use same, and also to regulate the means of supporting oral
communication. In our country there are nearly a million people with different types and
degrees of deafness.

In compliance with said Law, public authorities are empowered to promote the provision of
interpretation services in Spanish sign languages to all people who are deaf, hearing
impaired or deaf and blind, when they so require in the different public and private
spheres. Specifically:
•

The Law covers inclusion of the bilingual educational model in teaching and that sign
language is therefore to be used to convey teaching to deaf students at certain schools
(article 10);

•

Due to this Law, the public authorities, political parties and social players must facilitate
full accessibility to deaf people vis-à-vis their institutional information and in the freely
issued audiovisual programmes. They should also include sign language interpreters at
public plenary meetings and those of general interest of the Parliament, legislatures of
the Autonomous Communities, provincial councils and local bodies and authorities
(article 13);

•

The necessary measures must be promoted so that the news media, institutional
publicity campaigns, different audiovisual supports and emergency messages from
institutions are accessible in sign language.

Canarian Silbo
•

Silbo is a whistled language practiced by some inhabitants of La Gomera in the Canary
Islands to communicate over distance. According to various studies, the whistled
language uses six sound, two of them called vowels and the other four consonants,
and it can express more than 4,000 concepts (words). Due to the risk of Silbo
disappearing in the early 21st century, basically due to improved means of
communication and especially the disappearance of activities such as herding which
used it the most, the Canarian government implemented its learning in school and in
1999 declared Silbo Gomero to be part of the Canary Islands’ ethnographic heritage.

THIRD PART: OFFICIALLY RECOGNISED LANGUAGES IN THE
AUTONOMOUS

STATUTES

OF

THE

SPANISH

AUTONOMOUS

COMMUNITIES
In order to discuss the languages considered in this third part of the report, an order has
been established which reflects the number of speakers of these languages. Information
has therefore been provided with regard to each language following the structure
established in articles 8 to 14 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
An introduction to each language is also included.

3.1. CATALAN (CATALONIA AND THE BALEARIC ISLANDS)

INTRODUCTION
This report on the use of Catalan in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands,
firstly responds to the questions made by the Committee of Experts which are not
answered in the content of the report. These questions are as follows:
Question nº 25 of the Committee of Experts. What is the impact on the Catalan language
of the new Statute of Autonomy? Could the Committee of Experts provide information on
its implementation?
As the General Administration of the Linguistic Policy of the Government of the Balearic
Islands has been able to observe, the new statute has not had any impact on the Catalan
language, or if it has had impact, this has been minimal.
Question nº 756 of the Committee of Experts. The Committee of Experts has requested
the authorities to communicate their observations on the matter of the prohibition made by
the police (the Civil Guard) to an Arabic and Tamazight interpreter regarding the use of
Catalan and the conviction of this person by the courts, as this person would have decided
to speak a language which was not understood by the civil servants.

199

After contacting the Office of Linguistic Rights of the Balearic Cultural Association (which
the interpreter contacted in order to report employment discrimination for linguistic
reasons), we were informed that this case has not yet been brought to trial. It must be
noted that the interpreter was working for the Civil Guard and not the National Police
Force.

The Application of Article 8
Paragraph 1. With respect to teaching and with regard to that which refers to the area in
which the above-mentioned languages are spoken and according to the situation of each
of these, without prejudice to the teaching of the official state language or languages, the
parties agree to:

Paragraph 1 Measures:

sub-paragraph a)
i) establish a guaranteed pre-school education in the corresponding regional or minority
languages;

sub-paragraph b)
i) provide a guaranteed primary school education in the corresponding regional or
minority languages; or

sub-paragraph c)
i) provide a guaranteed secondary school education in the corresponding regional or
minority languages;

Catalan in pre-school, primary, secondary and pre-university education
The regulatory legal structure for education in the Balearic Islands establishes that:
a) Pupils cannot be separated for reasons of language, i.e. all pupils, regardless of their
origin or of the moment when they were incorporated into the educational system of the
Balearic Islands, must be fluent in the two official languages of our autonomous
200

community at the end of their compulsory education. The educational centres are
responsible for applying the appropriate strategies in order to attain this objective.
b) The linguistic project of the centre forms part of its educational project and must take
into consideration all regulations when being drafted.
c) The linguistic project of the centre is drafted by a commission and approved by the
school council, the highest governmental body in the educational centre, in which the
entire school community participates (mothers and fathers, pupils, service staff and the
council).
d) Basically, the regulation which governs the linguistic project of the centre is that
established by Law 3/1986 of 29 April, on the Linguistic Normalisation of the Balearic
Islands (Article 1.2):
• To make the progressive and normal use of the Catalan language effective in the
official and administrative areas.
• To ensure the understanding and the progressive use of Catalan as the vehicular
language in the area of education.
In this way, at least 50% of school subjects must be taught in Catalan. Fathers, mothers or
legal tutors may choose the first teaching language in an individual manner; this involves
individualised treatment in one or another language. However, these children, when they
reach the first course of the first cycle of primary school, must be able to receive,at least
50% of their education in Catalan, regardless of the language which their legal guardians
have chosen for their initial education.
The objective is to ensure that the children learn to speak, write and understand the two
official languages. It must be noted that the so-called Decree of Trilingualism, which the
experts mention in their report, was revoked by Decree 67/2008, of 6 June.
With respect to the demand for understanding the two official languages by the teaching
staff of the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture, it must be said that no primary or
secondary school teacher may take the professional entrance exams if he or she does not
have linguistic resources in both official languages of the autonomous community.
The Directorate General of Innovation and Teacher Training initiated the Plan for
Reception, Integration and Educational Reinforcement (PAIRE) during the 2008-2009
course; which brings together twelve actions, measures and specific programmes which
seek to improve attention for late-entry students in the education system of the Balearic
201

Islands. More than 4,000 students from 8 to 16 years of age from 178 educational centres
in the Balearic Islands have benefited from this programme.
This plan has become a fundamental instrument for the development of those necessary
actions which will facilitate the equal treatment of different cultures and will strengthen
social integration and the capacity of students to learn to live together in culturally diverse
contexts.
The PAIRE has been conceived as a broad-ranging plan which covers all those actions
which late-entry foreign students receive with respect to reception, language education,
the compensation of inequalities and school integration.
The Service of Education in Catalan, which belongs to the General Directorate of
Administration, Organisation and Educational Inspection, carries out the following actions
for the protection and promotion of Catalan:
1. The publication of teaching materials suited to the educational needs of the school
students.
2. Direct assessment is offered to 180 centres of infant and primary education; this
involves the Support Team for Teaching in Catalan, with offices in Palma, Inca,
Manacor, Menorca and Ibiza, which is formed by ten assessors.
3. The actions of the linguistic normalisation coordinators for the compulsory secondary
education centres of the Balearic Islands are assessed and planned.
4. The coordination of the linguistic volunteers in the secondary education centres. During
the 2008-2009 Course 19 centres have undertaken voluntary linguistic initiatives
among students.
5. Families and educational centres are assessed with respect to the treatment of the
languages in the framework of a multi-lingual reality in order to channel those initiatives
which focus on the linguistic normalisation of the Catalan language.
6. The management of all standardisation documents for the teaching of the Catalan
language with the regulated educational courses.
7. The promotion and coordination of the Xarxa (Network) programme – materials which
are used through a distance program via Internet. The materials are published in
Catalan.

202

8. Together with the Educational Information Technology Service, a Catalan learning
program has been initiated in line with the objective of facilitating understanding and
the practice of basic abilities.
The Service of Educational Inspection of the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture is
involved in the centres to ensure the fulfilment of applicable norms with respect to teaching
in Catalan and the investigation undertaken by the Department of Educational Inspection
with regard to the reality of teaching in Catalan and the real development of the linguistic
projects of the educational centres.
In the area of formal teaching in the Balearic Islands, the Consortium for the Promotion of
Catalan (COFUC) has carried out various initiatives.
The following activities have been undertaken for the Linguistic Reception Project:
1. A complementary activity to linguistic reception during the school course. A training
activity is organised which is complementary to the PALIC programme or the
Reception Class.
2. A linguistic reception activity (for pupils between 12 and 18 years of age) during the
summer.
The following activities have been undertaken to promote reading:
The Reading School

The Reading School Programme seeks to promote the habit of reading and consolidate
linguistic abilities in Catalan among the school population of the Balearic Islands, from
infant education to secondary education, both in public education centres and in private
and subsidized centres.
In order to attain these objectives, the Consortium (COFUC) offers two types of materials;
book bags, as part of a loan scheme, which are available to infant, primary and secondary
schools and reading books.

Book Bags
203

The book bags contain books, various materials and educational proposals for working in
the classroom. They are focused on infant and primary education and the first cycle of
secondary education. The books created for infant education are: A selection of short
stories Biblioteca de aula, La rabosa i l’eriçó (a story) and La rateta que agranava
l’escaleta (a play); for primary education: La rabosa i l’eriçó (a story), La rateta que
agranava l’escaleta (a play), La filla del carboneret (a story), Na Ventafocs (a play), En
Gostí lladre (a story) and Aladí i la llàntia meravellosa (a play); for secondary education
Entre el cel la terra (narrative), L’anell de Boken-Rau (narrative) and Les noces del cel i de
la terra (narrative).

Reading Books

The reading books seek to bring secondary school pupils closer to classical and
contemporary authors from the islands. They comprise 6 reading guides: El bloc del
bogamarí, El raïm del Sol i de la Lluna, Memorial de Tabarka, Isidor Macabich, Salvador
Galmés and Joan Ramis i Ramis.
The Consortium (COFUC) has published plays and teaching material (support boxes and
theatre play boxes) which form part of the content of the bags and the reading books. With
respect to books with adaptations of stories, it has published: La rabosa i l’eriçó, La filla del
carboneret, En Gostí lladre, La cadernera and En Pere de la favera. These books are
accompanied by support boxes for the adaptations of the stories of the same title.
It has also published the teaching book and the support file El capell volador. Other
publications have been dedicated to theatrical adaptations, such as La rateta que
agranava l’escaleta, Aladí i la llàntia meravellosa, Na Ventafocs and Na Blancaneu. At the
same time tool boxes have been created for the adaptations of plays which bear the same
titles as the books. With respect to reading books, works by the following authors have
been re-published: Joan Cardona, Isidor Macabich, Ponç Pons and Miquel Rayó.

sub-paragraph d)
i) establish a guaranteed technical and professional education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages;
204

The Directorate General of Teaching Staff, employees of the Regional Ministry of Education
and Culture, published a resolution in the Official Gazette of the Balearic Islands (the last
edition was published on 10 October 2009), signed by their director which establishes the
bases for the regulation of the convocation of the list of candidates to provisionally cover
substitutions in all speciality areas in non-university public educational centres which are
dependent on the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture of the Government of the
Balearic Islands in an interim policy. The regulation establishes that knowledge of Catalan
must be verified in all speciality areas in public centres.
Catalan courses have been held and organised by municipal bodies, non-profit associations
and trade unions and which have benefited from the series of subsidies which the
Directorate General of Linguistic Policy implemented for this purpose.

sub-paragraph e)
iii) if, due to the role of the state with respect to higher education centres, sections i) and
ii) cannot be applied, the promotion and/or authorisation of the establishment of university
education or other forms of higher education in the regional or minority languages, or of
means which allow these languages to be studied at university or in other higher education
centres will be undertaken;

Catalan in University Education
The University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) has organisational autonomy for the use of
Catalan in all areas of its authority, according to that established by Article 5 of Decree
170/2003 of 26 September 2003, which approved the statutes of the UIB:
The Catalan language used by the University of the Balearic Islands, has, together with
Spanish, the character of an official language and all members of the university have the
right to use it. The university will normalise the use of Catalan in the area of its
responsibilities.

205

The University of the Balearic Islands is also the official institution for consultations with
respect to Catalan. Article 6 of the above mentioned decree states:
The University of the Balearic Islands is the official consultative institution for all that
which refers to the Catalan language, as established by the Statute of Autonomy of the
Balearic Islands.

As a language of common usage in its communications, its web page can be consulted at
www.uib.cat.

sub-paragraph f
i) make arrangements so that teaching courses for adults or the continuing education
courses are taught mainly or entirely in regional or minority languages;

Article 6 of Law 4/2006 of 30 March, on education and continual training for adults in the
Balearic Islands establishes that:
With respect to the language, culture and society of the Balearic Islands
1. Within a multicultural world and in an autonomous state, the cultural, linguistic and
social reality of the Balearic Islands, due to its range and size, will be taken into
account in the development and the application of this law.
2. Those initiatives which promote the preservation and the development of the Catalan
language and the culture of the Balearic Islands will be considered as priority actions in
this area.
3. The public administration bodies of the Balearic Islands will ensure that those bodies
and centres dedicated to educational activities for adults undertake initiatives and
educational courses related to the Catalan language of the Balearic Islands and the
culture, the economy and the society of the Balearic Islands.
4. The public administration bodies of the Balearic Islands will promote the
understanding of our linguistic and cultural reality.
5. The Public Administration Bodies of the Balearic Islands will facilitate, by means of
different programmes, the development of the sense of citizenship among the adult
population, so that they may actively participate in equal terms in access to cultural,
economic and social assets and services.

The Consortium (COFUC), in the area of non-regulated linguistic education for adults in
the Balearic Islands has fostered the organisation of courses, seminars, conferences, selflearning centres and all types of educational techniques and strategies. It has undertaken
different activities.

209

Catalan Language Courses
The COFUC Consortium has organised Catalan language courses in different modes:
non-intensive class-based courses for adults in Catalan for initial, elementary, medium and
higher levels; intensive class-based courses for adults in Catalan for initial, elementary,
medium and higher levels; Catalan language distance courses for elementary and medium
levels; and Catalan language courses for foreigners, for Levels 1 and 2. It has also
undertaken courses for parents which are held in the same schools where their children
study in order to facilitate their access to the Catalan language.
Catalan Language Self-learning Centres and Points
Since 2004 the COFUC Consortium has administered the CAL centres and the PAL selflearning points. These are areas which are equipped with means and materials to facilitate
the individualised learning of Catalan and which adjust to the needs and the personal
rhythm of each student. Different centres have been created throughout all the islands: the
CAL of Llevant (Palma), the CAL University of the Balearic Islands (Palma), the CAL Ibiza
and thel CAL Francesc de Borja Moll (Ciutadella); and the self-learning points: the PAL
Emili Darder, the PAL Son Dureta, the PAL of Alcudia, the PAL of Sant Antoni de
Portmany, the PAL of Santa Eulària des Riu, the PAL of Formentera, the PAL of Son
Servera and the PAL of Sant Josep de Sa Talaia.

The Catalan Language Educational Programme (The PELC)
The PELC is an Internet-based Catalan self-learning programme. It is an online resource
for learning Catalan.

sub-paragraph g: take measures to ensure that the education of the history and the
culture of that which is the expression of the regional or minority language:;

The teaching of the history and culture of the Balearic Islands is included in all the
curricular itineraries of the various education levels detailed in the previous sections.
The Department of Educational Inspection of the Regional Ministry of Education and
Culture intervenes in order to ensure the fulfilment of the applicable norms with respect to
210

teaching in Catalan. This same department monitors education in Catalan in the centres
and the real development of the linguistic projects in centres.

sub-paragraph h: guarantee the initial and permanent education of the teaching staff
necessary for the application of that established in paragraphs a) to g) which the party has
accepted;;

The plan for recycling and linguistic and cultural education is established in the ruling of
the Ministry of Education and Culture of 20 August 2008, and the qualifications required
are determined for the teaching of classes in and of the Catalan language in the nonuniversity educational centres of the Balearic Islands. All teaching staff must pass a
specific seminar on the history and geography of the Balearic Islands.

sub-paragraph i: create one or various control bodies which are responsible for the
monitoring of the measures adopted and of the progress made in the establishment or
development of the teaching of the regional or minority languages, and to draw up
periodical reports which will be made public with respect to this.

paragraph 2: With respect to education and with regard to that which refers to territories
different from those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally spoken,
the parties agree to authorise, foster or establish the teaching of or in the regional or
minority language, at those levels which are considered appropriate, if the number of
speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

In 2008, the Government of the Balearic Islands was readmitted as part of the Ramon Llull
Institute (IRL), and took on the functions of this institute with respect to the projection of
the Catalan language and of the culture expressed in it.
The IRL promotes the presence, the investigation and the learning of Catalan and its
reality in universities throughout the world, it fosters investigation work on Catalan
language and culture and provides support and encouragement to Catalan entities.

211

In this section the agreement signed in 2008 with the Associació d’Amics de la Bressola
(The Association of Friends of La Bressola) should be mentioned, which fosters teaching
in Catalan in the French Department of the Eastern Pyrenees.
The Application of Article 9
Paragraph 1. The parties agree, with respect to that which refers to the area divisions of
the judicial authorities in which the number of persons who reside there and who speak the
regional or minority languages, justifies the following specific measures, according to the
situation of each one of these languages and on the condition that the court does not
consider that the use of the possibilities offered in this paragraph constitutes an obstacle
for the proper administration of justice:

a) in criminal proceedings:

sub-paragraph a.i): to ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties, undertake their procedures in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph a, ii): to guarantee the accused the right to express him/her self in his /her
regional or minority language; and/or
sub-paragraph a, iii): to ensure that the demands and tests, be they written or oral, are
not considered unacceptable for the sole reason that they have been written in a regional
or minority language; and/or

The General Directorate of Mobility for the Regional Ministry of Transport and Territorial
Planning of the Government of the Balearic Islands is reintroducing Catalan as the main
language of communication with users of Balearic Islands transportation.

With the transfer of the Indexplà website tool by the Catalan Government, the General
Directorate of Linguistic Policy will be able to evaluate the use of Catalan in the
autonomous administrative bodies.

Article 14 of Law 3/1986 of 29 April on the linguistic standardisation of the Balearic Islands
refers to toponyms, as can be seen in the previous section.

The Application of Article 11

Paragraph 1. For the speakers of regional or minority languages, in the territories in which
these languages are spoken, in accordance with the situation of each one of these and to
the extent that the public authorities, in a direct or indirect manner have the authority,
attributions or a role to play in the aforementioned area, while respecting the principles of
independence and autonomy of the communication media, the parties agree:

228

sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent in which the radio and the television have a public
service role, a: to guarantee the creation of at least one radio station and one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph b, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station in
the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph c, i) to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

The public body Radiotelevision of the Balearic Islands (EPRTVIB) was founded on 26
March 2004, in the development of the law of its creation in May 1985, integrating the
autonomous public radio and television companies under the company name IB3.

The current model of IB3 offers all of its programmes in Catalan, using standard Catalan in
all its productions as this is another variety of Catalan which the speakers of the language
may use in a formal space such as that offered by a public communications channel.

Since 2008 the University of the Balearic Islands (as the institution of maximum reference
in terms of linguistic matters) provides services of linguistic assessment to the public body
Radiotelevision of the Balearic Islands.

Apart from RTVE, which applies a brief disconnection from its state (Spanish)
programming, which is broadcast in Catalan, no other state area channel will be compelled
to use Catalan in its habitual programming. The use of Catalan will be limited to
autonomous, island and local television channels and those from other Catalan-speaking
territories. The TV3 signal received in the Balearic Islands today is that broadcast
internationally.

The presence of the Catalan language in DTT in the local television channels of the
Balearic Islands is regulated by Decree 31/2006 of the 31st of March by the Government
of the Balearic Islands, which regulates the legal system of DTT concessions in the area of
the Balearic Islands. The text established the demand level of the language in the
broadcasts of these channels, which must be at least 51%, of the broadcasting time in
each one of the time slots.
229

The agreement on audiovisual material which was signed by the Government of the
Balearic Islands and the Catalan Government has been mentioned previously.

The General Directorate of Linguistic Policy promotes the broadcasting of Real Mallorca
football team matches in Catalan on the COPE Mallorca radio station and two
programmes (Calaix de sastre, which deals with linguistic problems, and disconnection
programmes which broadcast music in Catalan) on the same station in Menorca.

sub-paragraph d: to foster and/or facilitate the production and dissemination of audio and
audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

The production and dissemination of audio and audiovisual works in the regional or
minority languages is fostered and facilitated through subsidies from the Ramon Llull
Institute, the Institute of Balearic Studies and the General Directorate of Culture.

As responsibilities in cultural matters are transferred to each one of the four island
councils, these are largely responsible for the promotion of the production and
broadcasting of audio and audiovisual works.

sub-paragraph e, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at least
one press body in the regional or minority languages;

The General Directorate of Linguistic Policy has signed an annual subsidy agreement with
the Press Association of Mallorca (Associació de Premsa Forana de Mallorca) which
produces some fifty publications in Catalan. This same Directorate General has a line of
subsidies for publications written entirely in Catalan. In 2009 41 requests were presented
and 39 written publications were included in this line of subsidies.

All the contract contests for subsidies with respect to the communications media which are
offered by the General Directorate of Communication of the Regional Ministry of the
Presidency give higher qualifications to those media which use Catalan more.

230

sub-paragraph f, ii): to extend the existing measures of financial assistance for
audiovisual productions in regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for those
communications media which use the regional or minority languages.

paragraph 2: The parties agree to guarantee the freedom of direct reception for radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language which is spoken in an
identical or similar manner to a regional or minority language, and to not oppose the
broadcasting of radio and television broadcasts of neighbouring countries in this language.
They are also obliged to ensure that no restriction on the freedom of expression and the
free circulation of information in a language spoken in an identical or similar manner to a
regional or minority language is imposed. The exercise of the freedoms mentioned above,
which entail duties and responsibilities, may be subject to certain procedures, conditions,
restrictions or sanctions established by the law, which constitute necessary measures in a
democratic society for national security, territorial integrity or public safety, the defence of
order and the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morality, the protection of
reputation or the rights of others, in order to prevent the disclosure of confidential
information or to guarantee the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary.

paragraph 3: The parties agree to ensure that the interest of the speakers of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into consideration in the framework of the
structures which may be created in compliance with the law, in order to guarantee the
freedom and plurality of the media.

This information is not possessed by the Government of the Balearic Islands as a sociolinguistic survey should be held with regard to this matter; this measure has not been
undertaken.

Finally, the General Directorate of Linguistic Policy has commissioned a survey to be carried
out by Ibestat (The Statistical Institute of the Balearic Islands). The proposed questionnaire
seeks to evaluate the current situation of Catalan in the Balearic Islands in order to compare
the data with other previous surveys. It also seeks to obtain information on the
understanding, the use and the attitudes of the public with respect to Catalan.
231

The Application of Article 12

Paragraph 1. With respect to activities and cultural services, especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, in
addition to literary works and film production, traditional cultural expression, festivals,
cultural industries, including in particular the use of new technology, the parties, in what is
referred to as the territory in which the aforementioned languages are spoken, and to the
extent in which the public authorities have authority, attributions or a role to play in the
area, agree to:

Sub-paragraph a): foster the expression of - and initiatives in - the regional or minority
languages and aid the different means of access to works produced in these languages;

With reference to the autonomous community:
The General Directorate of Culture of the Government of the Balearic Islands seeks,
among other objectives, the promotion and divulgation of the culture of the Balearic
Islands. This means that in all the initiatives undertaken by this General Directorate there
is a special sensitivity to the use of the Catalan language.
The following actions must be emphasised in this area:

•

Publications

All the publications of books and bibliographic material produced by the General
Directorate of Culture and by the cultural centres it administers are produced in the
Catalan language.
•

The Promotion and Divulgation of the Fine Arts

The exhibitions organised by the General Directorate of Culture are undertaken in Catalan.
Its catalogues and other informative material are printed in bilingual or even trilingual
versions (Catalan, Spanish, English).
•

The “Viu la Cultura” Programme
232

This programme uses Catalan exclusively, both in its activities and in catalogues and
printed informational material; it is aimed at showing students in educational centres of the
Balearic Islands the area’s historical and artistic heritage and its cultural reality through
cultural activities, visits to museums, cultural centres, etc.
•

Libraries

The libraries administered by the Directorate General of Culture of the Government of the
Balearic Islands undertake all their activities in Catalan and use this language in signs and
printed documents, etc. The acquisition of bibliographic funds for libraries is mainly
undertaken in Catalan.
Those libraries administered by the Government of the Balearic Islands hold copies of all
works published in Catalan.
Those libraries administered by the Government of the Balearic Islands participate in the
“You Ask” programme, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Culture with the
autonomous communities, which allows the public to access the libraries of different
autonomous communities via Internet, requesting information and communicating doubts
and other questions. Users can ask questions in Catalan.

•

Archives and Museums

All the publications, exhibitions and informative material produced by the archives and
museums administered by the Directorate General of Culture are in Catalan or where
applicable, in a bilingual or even trilingual version (Catalan, Spanish, English), and these
bodies use Catalan language in their other activities, printed documents, signs, etc.

•

Theatre, Music and Traditional Cultural Activities

The Directorate General of Culture promotes theatre, musical and traditional cultural
activities undertaken in Catalan without prejudice to the fact that some specific
representations may be made in Spanish, especially if held outside the area of the
Balearic Islands or in those areas where Catalan is spoken. The Directorate General of
233

Culture, in addition to promoting these activities, participates actively in the co-production
of works undertaken in Catalan.
•

Participation in Cultural Projects and Projects of Cultural Administration with
other Bodies

This administration body participates in those cultural projects and activities which lie
within its area of authority, such as participation in consortiums and foundations (the
Consortium of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Palma, the Public
Foundation of the Balearic Islands for Music, the Consortium for the Promotion of the
Catalan Language and the Overseas Projection of the Culture of the Balearic Islands),
participation with other institutions and cultural centres, and it undertakes all its activities in
Catalan.
•

Promotional Activities

The Directorate General of Culture periodically facilitates subsidies for undertaking
activities which involve the promotion and the divulgation of the culture of the Balearic
Islands, both within its own territory and outside of it, either through the organisation of
fairs, festivals, competitions, the production of theatre plays, the shooting of short-films
and feature films, etc. All of these activities are undertaken in Catalan, except those which
are held in areas where Catalan is not spoken.
The Campaign for the Promotion of Reading, which was initiated jointly by the Government
of the Balearic Islands and by the Government of Catalonia, offers in the communications
media, sub-paragraphs from books in Catalan as samples of the literary works. This
initiative is called “Tasta’m” (“Try me”).

Another initiative undertaken by the Directorate General of Culture has been the naming of
the Writer of the Year. In 2009 Baltasar Porcel was nominated for this title. His works have
been widely publicised.

As mentioned above, as the island ministries or councils are responsible for the cultural
sector, these bodies also promote and divulge the culture of the Balearic Islands. The
Premis Mallorca de Creació Literària (The Mallorca Awards for Literary Creation) in
234

Catalan are noteworthy, which were created as the awards which provide the greatest
financial support in Catalan.

With respect to the actions of the Ministry of Culture:

The Promotion of the Preservation, Divulgation and Understanding of the Co-official
Languages

In 2007 competitive subsidies were provided through the General Administration for
Cultural Cooperation and Communication of the Ministry of Culture for the financing of
investment projects of cultural institutions which promote the preservation, the divulgation
and the understanding of Catalan in the Balearic Islands, with a maximum attributable total
which reached 1,000,000 euros.

These subsidies continued in 2009 through a nominative grant for cultural works from the
Balearic Islands of 500,000 € for the linguistic promotion of the Catalan language.

The Promotion of Film and Audiovisual Media

Current Legislation on the Subject

Law 55/2007 of 28 December on Film, in Article 36 establishes that:

“In order to attend to the promotion and protection of the use of the co-official
languages distinct to Spanish in films and audiovisual media, promoting the cultural
plurality of Spain and the equal opportunities of the languages of each territory with
respect to audiovisual expression and divulgation, a fund or subsidies or specific
credits will be established which will be transferred entirely to the competent bodies of
the autonomous communities which will administer them in accordance with their
powers. This state contribution, based on the principle of co-responsibility, will be
provided each year in the General State Budgets and will be destined to the
production, distribution, exhibition and promotion of the film and audiovisual industry in
the above-mentioned languages”.

235

The Additional Sixth Stipulation of the Law of Film, which relates to the agreements for the
fostering of film and audiovisual media in co-official languages distinct from Spanish,
establishes that:

“The Ministry of Culture, by agreement, will determine those credits established in
Article 36 of the Law, in a way such that the funding received by each autonomous
community in the co-official language, is the annual equivalent to the sum of
contributions which this community has made during the previous financial year for the
support and fostering of the production, distribution and promotion of the audiovisual
industry in the co-official language distinct to Spanish. The funding received by each
autonomous community will not exceed 50 percent of the total of the subsidies which
audiovisual companies resident in this community have received from the ICAA during
the previous financial year”.

Royal Decree 2062/2008 of the 12th of December, which modifies the Law of Film in
Article 19.3, regulates the above-mentioned Article 36.

Relevant actions undertaken
In the general state budgets for 2008 a subsidy of 2,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute (Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las
Artes Audiovisuales -ICAA) from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose and which was
transferred to the Balearic Islands for 29,750 €
In the general state budgets for 2009, a subsidy of 10,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the ICAA from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose, the distribution of this
subsidy will be processed once the corresponding agreements are approved and signed
by the parties.
Independently of that established in the Law of Film, Royal Decree 526/2002, of 14
December already established facilities for obtaining the subsidies for the amortization of
films made by producers who made films whose original version was in a co-official
language distinct from Spanish. These subsidies have been made available since 2003 to
the present.

236

The Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature
In the subsidies open to competition in this area, the bases of the awards stipulate that
they are open to all the co-official languages of the state and aim to encourage private
intercommunication between the Spanish cultures. Members of business associations or
the academies of the above-mentioned languages form part of the evaluation committees
with respect to some of these subsidies:

Subsidies for non-profit companies and institutions, publishers of culture
magazines written in any co-official language of Spain. The objective of these subsidies
is to attain the free distribution of cultural magazines in the distinct official languages of
Spain in languages and cultural centres in Spain and abroad.
Subsidies for the promotion of reading and the divulgation of Spanish literature,
through the undertaking of activities which promote common Spanish culture in Spain
and abroad, through conferences, seminars, etc., the participation and celebration of
commemorations and centennials – especially of writers -, the fostering of reading
habits and the promotion of the use of public libraries. Activities in the co-official
languages take place in those which are subsidised every year.
Subsidies for the publication in any co-official language of Spain of literary works.
This convocation subsidises projects for publishing works from our culture, of national
and international projection in the co-official languages of Spain, which contribute to the
enrichment of our common bibliographic heritage, with the dual objective of extending
the funds of the public libraries of Spain and fostering and encouraging communication
and cultural cohesion between the autonomous communities, creating a common
bibliographic archive in all public libraries.

National Literature Awards

Regarding the national awards awarded by the Ministry of Culture, representatives of the
academies of the co-official languages are included, and in the criteria of these awards it is
established that works and authors in any of the Spanish languages may be proposed.
Many of these awards have been given to written works and authors who write in
languages other than Spanish.
237

The Promotion of the Scenic Arts and Music

During the 2006-2008 period, the Directorate General of the National Institute of the
Scenic Arts and Music (INAEM) has followed a policy to promote expression in the
regional languages of Spain in the awarding of subsidies for programmes of divulgation,
development and the preservation of the theatre and the circus and theatre and circusorientated communication.

This is established in the resolutions of the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music of
26 December 2005, of 26 February 2007 and of 8 February 2008, which make subsidies
available for programmes for the divulgation, development and preservation of the theatre
and the circus and theatre and circus-orientated communication for the years 2006, 2007
and 2008, respectively.

In this sense the requirements established for participating in the programme of theatre
divulgation in the national area are made flexible if the theatre productions are performed
solely in one of the official languages distinct from Spanish. This flexibility consists in the
non-application of two conditions which are compulsory for other requests: firstly, that
touring projects are undertaken in at least three autonomous communities, and in second
place, that at least 40% of the performances take place outside the autonomous
community which corresponds to the company address of the party requesting the
subsidy.

Sub-paragraph b): to encourage different means of access in other languages to works
produced in the regional or minority languages, aiding and developing the activities of
translation, dubbing, post-synchronistation and subtitling;

Sub-paragraph c): to encourage access in the regional or minority languages to works
produced in other languages, aiding and developing the activities of translation, dubbing,
post-synchronistation and subtitling

With respect to the actions of the Ministry of Culture:

1. The Translation of Published Works
238

The Ministry of Culture awards the following subsidies for translation each year:
Subsidies for the translation and publication in any foreign language of literary or
scientific works by Spanish authors which were originally written and published in any
of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture overseas and are open to any work from Spain written in any co-official
language.
Subsidies for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain
to other co-official languages of Spain which were originally written and published in
any of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture in Spain. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.
Sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
various forms of cultural activities suitably integrate the understanding and the practice of
the languages and of the regional or minority cultures into the activities whose initiative
depends on these bodies or those bodies who provide their support for such activities.

Sub-paragraph e): to encourage the provision of staff who speak the regional or minority
language, in addition to the language(s) of the rest of the population to organisations
responsible for organising or supporting cultural activities;

Sub-paragraph f): to encourage the direct participation of speakers of the regional or
minority language, with respect to services and any cultural activity programmes;

Sub-paragraph g): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of one or several bodies
responsible for gathering, receiving in bond and presenting or publishing the works
produced in regional or minority languages

With respect to the actions of the Ministry of Culture:

1. The Deposit of Published Works

The National Library acts as the organisation for depositing works published in any
language within Spanish territory.
239

2. Reference collections

The National Library has reference collections in different subjects in all the co-official
languages of Spain.

Sub-paragraph h): where applicable, to create and/or promote and finance services of
translation and terminological investigation with a view to specifically maintaining and
developing, in each regional or minority language an appropriate administrative,
mercantile, economic, social or legal terminology.

Paragraph 2. With respect to those territories distinct from those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the parties are obliged to authorise, foster and/or
plan appropriate activities or cultural services in compliance with the above paragraph if
the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

Paragraph 3: The parties agree, in their overseas cultural policy to provide a suitable
space for the regional or minority languages and to the culture which these express.

With respect to the Ministry of Culture:

1. Book Fairs and the Delivery of Bibliographic Packs to Cultural Centres

In international book fairs which Spain attends with its own pavilion, or through the
administration of embassies, new publications which are displayed will include books and
magazines in all the languages of Spain, partly from the subsidies provided to editors of
magazines and the publication of books. The same applies to the packs of books sent to
libraries and cultural centres.
Furthermore, with respect to the mobility of authors overseas in fairs, conferences, etc.,
Spanish authors will participate in these, regardless of the co-official language in which
they write.
With respect to the Ministry of Foreing Affairs and Cooperation:

The Cervantes Institute reports that it has signed various participatory agreements with
several cultural institutions for the divulgation of the co-official languages as part of
240

overseas cultural policy. This includes academic and teaching activities with the following
institutions: the Ramón Llull Institute, the Royal Academy of the Vasca-Euskaltzaindia
Language, the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language, the Galician Royal Academy of
Language and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Galician Government.

The Cervantes Institute has been offering courses for learning Catalan, Galician and
Basque since the academic year of 1994-1995. Several graphs are shown, detailing the
development of the courses held over the last few years.

The Application of Article 13
Paragraph 1. With respect to economic and social activities and for the entire country, the
parties agree:
241

Sub-paragraph a) to exclude from their legislation all provisions which prohibit or limit
without justifiable reasons, the use of regional or minority languages in those documents
which relate to economic or social life and especially in work contracts and in technical
documents, such as in the instructions for the use of products or services;

Sub-paragraph b) to prohibit the insertion in the internal regulations of companies and in
private documents, of clauses which exclude or limit the use of regional or minority
languages, at least among the speakers of the same language;

Sub-paragraph c) to oppose practices aimed at discouraging the use of regional or
minority languages in economic or social activities;

Sub-paragraph d) to facilitate and/or foster the use of regional or minority languages
through other means distinct to those considered in the above sections.

In the legislation of the Balearic Islands there is no legal stipulation which prohibits or limits
the use of the Catalan language.

Paragraph 2. With respect to economic and social activities and to the extent that the
public authorities are able, the parties, in the territory in which the regional or minority
languages are spoken and as far as is reasonably possible, agree:

Sub-paragraph a) To define, through their financial and banking regulations, modes which
allow, in conditions which are compatible with commercial use, the use of regional or
minority languages in the writing of payment orders (cheques, letters of exchange, etc.),
or other financial documents or, where applicable to ensure that these initiatives are put
into practice;

Sub-paragraph b) In economic and social sectors which directly depend on their control

residences and shelters offer the possibility of being received and attended to in the
language of the speakers of a regional or minority language who may require care for
reasons of health, age or for other reasons;

Sub-paragraph d) To ensure, through the appropriate means, that safety instructions are
also written in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph e) To facilitate the information provided by the authorities responsible on
the rights of consumers in the regional or minority languages.

Article 8 of Law 11/2001 of 15 June on the Organisation of Commercial Activity in the
Balearic Islands, establishes:

The Linguistic Rights of Consumers
1. In those establishments regulated in this law, consumers have the right to be
attended to in one of the official languages of the Balearic Islands and they may not
be discriminated or attended to incorrectly because of the official language which
they use.
2. In those retail establishments which employ a staff of more than three workers,
consumers also have the right to be attended to the in the official language of the
Balearic Islands which they choose.
3.

Permanent informative signs, posters and documents which offer services for
consumers in establishments open to the public must be drawn up in Catalan at
least. This regulation does not apply to brands, commercial names and the signs
covered by legislation pertaining to industrial property. In the terms established by
regulations, commercial establishments will inform their customers of their linguistic
rights through the placement of the corresponding notifications.

4. The administrative bodies responsible will promote the progressive use of the
Catalan language in commercial activities in addition to its use in signs, symbols
and insignia of the commercial establishments of the Balearic Islands.

Furthermore, the General Plan of Linguistic Standardisation which was approved by the
Social Council of the Catalan Language on 18 June 2009, dedicated Area 5 to
socioeconomic activities. Actions and objectives are envisaged for application in business
243

organisations, trade unions, private companies, public companies and concessionaries
and financial entities.

The Application of Article 14

The parties agree to:
Sub-paragraph a) Apply the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which link them
with the states in which the same language is spoken in an identical or similar manner, or
to attempt to finalise these agreements where applicable, in such a way that these
agreements may encourage contacts between the speakers of the same language in the
corresponding states, in the areas of culture, teaching, information, job training and
continual education;

Sub-paragraph b) Facilitate and/or promote cooperation across borders to the benefit of
the regional or minority languages, especially among regional or local groups in whose
territories the same language is spoken in an identical or similar manner.

The Government of the Balearic Islands was readmitted as part of the Ramon Llull Institute
of which the Principality of Andorra and the City of Alghero also form a part, through the
Foundation of the Ramon Llull Institute.

The Balearic Islands, together with Aragon and Catalonia, in addition to the French
regional councils of Languedoc-Roussillon and the Mid-Pyrenees, form part of the
Pyrenees Mediterranean Euro-Region which was created in 2004 in order to achieve
political coordination between the above-mentioned areas, and to promote territorial
cooperation projects in social, economic and institutional areas, among others.

Furthermore, the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, together with Catalonia
and the French Departments Languedoc-Roussillon and the Mid-Pyrenees, forms part of
the European Group of Territorial Cooperation (AECT) “Pyrenees Mediteranean” (2009),
which specifically seeks to plan, coordinate, develop, promote and organise its actions in
the areas defined in the protocol of October 2004 through which the above-mentioned
European Group of Territorial Cooperation was created, with the general objective of
strengthening the economic, social and territorial cohesion envisaged in the treaties of the
244

European Union. It should be noted that this group has established Catalan as a working
language in addition to Spanish and French.

3.1.1. CATALONIA

INTRODUCTION

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia is the basic institutional regulation of this
autonomous community, within the terms established in the constitution, to which it is
subordinated and in accordance with Article 147 of the constitution itself. It occupies the
same legal position as the other autonomous statutes in their respective communities.

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (hereafter referred to as the EAC), which was
reformed in 2006, contains a vast and detailed regulation of the use of the Catalan
language which is far more thorough than that of the previous Statute of 1979.

While the previous Statute of 1979 (which was still applicable in the stage covered by the
previous CELROM compliance report) dedicated two articles and an additional stipulation,
the new statute of 2006 devoted either directly or indirectly, more than twenty articles (5, 6,
11.2, 12, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 44.2, 50, 62.2, 65, 101.3, 102.1, 102.3, 102.4, 143,
146.3, 147, and 151), in addition the reference to the language contained in the prologue.

The extension of the regulation with respect to language is mainly based on the elevation
to statutory level of the basic elements of the pre-existing legislation, which was
established in Law 1/1998 of 7 January in Linguistic Policy, in addition to the introduction
of new aspects, such as the duty to understand Catalan or the recognition of exclusive
jurisdication with respect to language itself.

In a summarised form, the most noteworthy new features of the new Statute of Autonomy
of Catalonia of 2006 are as follows:
•

The elevation to statutory level of the basic principles of the pre-existing linguistic
legislation: Article 6, sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 (regulators of the principles of the Catalan
language as a unique and official language, 12 (which refers to the territories with
245

historical, linguistic and cultural links with Catalonia), 33 (regulator of linguistic rights
with respect to public administration bodies and state institutions), 34 (the linguistic
rights of consumers and users), 35 (linguistic rights in the area of education) and 50
(on the fostering and divulgation of Catalan).
•

The inclusion of matters which are the subject of the statutory reserve, which are not
included in the 1979 Autonomous Community Statute (EAC). This involves aspects
directly connected with the reference made to the Statutes by Article 3.2 of the Spanish
Constitution which were previously inexistent or which possessed a weaker regulatory
base. For examples, articles 6.2 (the duty to understand Catalan) and 143 (the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Catalan government with respect to language, which was
previously deduced from Article 3.3 of the EAC of 1979).

•

The strengthening of the linguistic obligations of the General State Department, of the
Justice Department, of notaries and registries, and the regulation of linguistic rights
with respect to constitutional and jurisdictional organs of a state level in articles 33,
37.1, 50.7, 101.3, 102.1 and 147.

•

The declaration of the Occitan language as an official language (previously known as
Aranese) in the Vall de Aran, although the statute refers to a future legal deployment of
the scope and content of this official recognition and its clear ascription to the Occitan
language and reality (articles 6.5, 11.2, 36, 50 and 143.2).

•

The elevation to statutory level of the linguistic combination in non-university education
in order to avoid linguistic separation, establishing the normal use of the right to
education in Catalan and the teaching of Catalan and Spanish (Article 35).

•

The recognition of the right to linguistic provisions in establishments open to the public,
although in accord with a later law (Article 34).

•

The recognition of Catalan sign language in Article 50.6, without this resulting in an
official status, although with the guarantee of the right to its use by deaf persons who
wish to use it as a means of communication.

With respect to the jurisdiction of the Catalan government in language matters, Article 143
is noteworthy, which grants it exclusive jurisdiction with respect to its own language
(Catalan) and jurisdiction on the linguistic standardisation of the Occitan language of Aran,
together with the General Council of Aran, and Article 146.3 which specifically establishes
jurisdiction on the fostering of linguistic pluralism in the communications media. Various
jurisdictional matters may also be considered to possess an implicit linguistic content, such
as associations and foundations (Article 118), savings banks (Article 120), commerce and
trade fairs (Article 121), consumption (Article 123), cooperatives (Article 124), public
246

corporations and certified professions (Article 125), culture (Article 127), education (Article
131), sport and leisure (Article 134), public functions (Article 136), immigration (Article
138), youth (Article 142), communications media (Article 146), the organisation of the
administration of the Catalan Government (Article 150), local structures (Article 160),
health, public health, pharmaceutical organisation and pharmaceutical products (Article
162), tourism (Article 171) and universities (Article 172).

In this linguistic area it should be noted that the recent sentence of the Constitutional Court
which resolved a challenge against the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, has declared
unconstitutional the initial provision of Article 6.1 of the aforementioned Statute in which
Catalan is a language of “preferential” use in public administration bodies and the public
communications media of Catalonia.
The Application of Article 8

Paragraph 1. With respect to education and with regard to the territory in which the abovementioned languages are spoken, according to the situation of each one of these, without
adversely affecting the teaching of the language or the official languages of the state, the
parties agree to:

Paragraph 1 Measures:

Sub-paragraph a, i): to provide a guaranteed pre-school education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages

In compliance with that established in Organic Law 2/2006 of 3 May, it corresponds to the
educational administrative bodies (autonomous communities) to determine the educational
contents of the first cycle of infant education (up to three years of age) and to regulate the
requirements which the centres which undertake this education must fulfil.

The Catalan Educational Administration has promulgated this regulation through Decree
282/2006 of 4 July, which regulates the first cycle of infant education and centre
requirements.

More specifically, Article 3.3 of the Decree establishes: “Catalan must be used normally as
247

a vehicular language and for learning in the first cycle of infant education, in addition to all
the activities and services which the centres offer, without adversely affecting that
established in Article 21.2 of Law 1/1998 of 7 July on Linguistic Policy and of the use of
Aranese in the Valle de Aran”

Article 21.2 of Law 1/1998, regulates the right of children to receive their first educational
course in their habitual language, be this Catalan or Spanish and that the government
must guarantee this right and facilitate those means necessary for this to be effective.

Sub-paragraph b, i): to provide a guaranteed primary education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages; or

Sub-paragraph c, i): to provide a guaranteed secondary education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages;

The EAC grants students the right to receive an education in Catalan. This right, together
with the right to non-segregation for reasons of language, are the foundations on which the
linguistic combination system stands, as established by Articles 20 and 21 of Law 1/1998.

Catalan is therefore the vehicular language and the language of learning in non-university
education, and the teaching of Catalan and of Spanish is guaranteed an appropriate
presence in study plans, such that all children, whatever their habitual language on starting
school, must speak both languages at the end of their compulsory education. In accord
with these provisions, educational centres in Catalonia normally use Catalan as a teaching
language.

The linguistic combination school system facilitates some initial areas of socialisation for
children in Catalan and facilitates the integration of pupils from the rest of Spain and from
abroad. This is especially relevant with respect to the exponential growth of foreign
students educated in Catalonia in recent years. This development is shown in the chart
below:

The Plan for Language and Social Cohesion
248

The system of linguistic combination brings with it the need to create spaces of linguistic
reception for pupils who have recently arrived in Catalonia, which offer them the support
and personalised attention necessary for them to follow the course normally, together with
the full integration of students and their family group and their cohesion with the
educational community which they have entered. In order to respond to these needs, the
Department of Education of the Catalan Government has applied, the Plan for Language
and Social Cohesion during the triennium pertaining to this report, which is based on a
global vision around the central nucleus of the school and in which all the institutions and
bodies related to education participate and cooperate to unite forces and so achieve the
full educational and social integration of all students in our educational system.

The general objective of the plan is to strengthen and consolidate social cohesion,
intercultural education and the Catalan language in a multilingual structure. The specific
objectives are as follows:
•

The consolidation of Catalan as the central core of a multilingual project.

•

The fostering of intercultural education based on equality, solidarity and respect
for the diversity of cultures within a framework of dialogue and cohabitation.

•

The promotion of equal opportunities in order to avoid any type of
marginalisation.

Reception Classes

Included in the Plan for Language and Social Cohesion is a series of projects among
which, as far as language is concerned, are the noteworthy reception classes. The
reception class in a reference framework and an open working area within the educational
centre which facilitates immediate and the most appropriate attention for recently arrived
students and which helps the teaching staff with new educational challenges. This
organisational structure provides a series of curricular and methodological measures,
curricular material, etc., which guarantee intensive language learning and the progressive
incorporation of students to normal classes. It involves a reception service which has been
shown to be totally efficient which the Government of Catalonia has channelled an

249

important number of resources into; in 2008, the final year of the three-year period
detailed, reception classes were allocated more than 44 million euros for new students.

The following chart shows the development in the composition of reception classes for
foreign students in compulsory education, the numbers of which easily exceed a thousand.
Of these more than half correspond to public centres of primary education.

The Local Area Educational Plans

The Plan for Language and Social Cohesion has an intra-educational character and is
complemented with local area educational plans which complement and reinforce the
educational actions of the teaching centres. Its main objective is the social cohesion of the
educational community and to support Catalan as a language of social relationships.

The starting point of a local area education plan is based on local initiatives from which a
corporate working network is created among the educational agents of a determined
territory. This networking process implies the involvement of local administrations, the
Government of Catalonia and civic bodies in the territory.

Local area education plans are not only aimed at pupils but at the entire educational
community, with special attention being given to the most vulnerable sectors of this
community. They consist in the organisation of complementary activities both during
250

school hours and out of school hours and also involve the teaching of their families in
aspects related to language, intercultural education, the education of children and conflict
resolution. This basically involves providing those students who live in a socio-culturally
disadvantaged environment with conditions which help them follow the school curriculum
with study workshops while for families it facilitates integration, the learning of the
language in which their children are schooled and the creation of a suitable cohabitation
framework.

The following chart illustrates the growth in the number of students from 3 to 6 years of
age who have participated in local area educational plans in recent years:

Centre Linguistic Projects:

The majority of educational centres in Catalonia created their centre linguistic projects
(PLC) in the decade of the nineties which, following the curricula which resulted from the
Organic Law of the General Organisation of the Educational System, made Catalan the
vehicular language in our non-university education system. These PLC were the heirs, in
the majority of cases, of those linguistic standardisation projects which had been initiated
due to the progressive incorporation of teaching in Catalan during the previous decade, an
incorporation which was much quicker in infant and primary school education than in
secondary education and which has been imbalanced with respect to the sociolinguistic
characteristics of the area.

Due to the deployment of the new curricula, the Department of Education has encouraged
the updating of centre linguistic projects (Order EDU/221/2007 of 29 June, which details
251

the general principles to be considered for the application of Article 4.4 of Decree
142/2007 of 26 June which establishes the Organisation of Primary School Teaching). The
objectives sought by this initiative are:
•

The consolidation of the Catalan language as a vehicular vehicular language in the

education system;
•

The adaptation of teaching methods and language learning, taking into

consideration the sociolinguistic context of the school’s location;
•

To guarantee that all students, regardless of their family language, on finishing

compulsory education are capable of using the two official languages, Catalan and
Spanish, (and Aranese in the Aran) both orally and in writing.
•

That students have a good understanding of a foreign language, and where

possible of a second foreign language.
•

Finally, within the structure of an intercultural education, to promote interest and

respect for all those languages present in our society (which, when possible will be
taught during after-school hours).

To facilitate the task of centres in updating the centre linguistic projects, the Department of
Education of the Government of Catalonia has made an application available
(http://www.xtec.cat/lic/projecte_ling.htm) which, with the support of assessors of language,
interculturality and social cohesion from the Department of Education and with the
supervision of Educational Inspection, has been provided to all educational centres in the
country.

Sub-paragraph d, i): to provide a guaranteed technical and vocational education in the
corresponding regional or minority languages;

In compliance with the basic state regulation (Organic Law 1/1990 of the 3 October, on the
General Organisation of the Educational System) it is the responsibility of the autonomous
communities with their due jurisdiction, to adapt studies to socio-economic characteristics,
in the establishment of curricula for vocational education.

Using this basic regulation, the Government of Catalonia has legally regulated nonregulated educational practices and specifically professional education, in Decree

252

332/1994 of 4 November, which establishes the general organisation of specific
professional education studies in Catalonia.

Article 6 of the above-mentioned decree establishes the following with respect to
languages used in professional education:

“6.1. Catalan as the language of Catalonia is also the language of professional
education. It will be used normally as a teaching language and as a vehicular
language.
6.2. In accordance with the representative bodies of the Vall d'Aran, the content which
will be taught in Aranese in the educational centres of the Vall d'Aran will be
established.
6.3. In all cases, the individual linguistic rights of the student will be respected in
compliance with currently applicable law.”

Vocational training

As part of the vocational training programmes promoted in Catalonia by the Employment
Service of Catalonia of the Department of Labour of the Government of Catalonia, the
Order of 9 October of 2000 incorporated the requirement to teach in Catalan at least 50%
of all vocational training activities. With the incorporation of this provision, the Government
of Catalonia seeks to help foster the understanding and the use of Catalan, and
disseminate the specific language and the terminology of each activity.
In all events, it should be noted that in addition to the provision of the use of Catalan as a
vehicular language in at least 50% of vocational training activities, all training activities
aimed at people seeking work who are registered in job training offices also complete
teaching hours in Catalan; this has fundamental and cross-cutting effects on aspects of the
language related to those employment objectives of professional vocational education
courses, such as the understanding and use of the terminology related to the job to which
the course is directed or those communicative tasks in the working environment which
relate to the search for employment and employment retention.

sub-paragraph e, iii): if, due to the role of the state with respect to higher education
centres, sub-paragraphs i) and ii) cannot be applied, the promotion and/or authorisation of
the establishment of university education or other forms of higher education in the regional
253

or minority languages or of means which allow these languages to be studied at university
or in other higher education centres will be undertaken;

Article 35 of the EAC establishes the following in the area of linguistic rights in university
education:

“1. All people have the right to receive an education in Catalan, in accordance with
that established in this statute. Catalan must be used normally as a vehicular
language and as a vehicular language in university education and non-university
education.”
“5. The teaching staff and students of university centres have the right to express
themselves orally and in writing in the official language which they choose.”

Sector-based legislation coincides in specifically establishing, in Law 1/2003 of 19
February, on Universities in Catalonia, in Article 6), that Catalan is the language of Catalan
universities and therefore the language of normal use for the undertaking of its activities.
Article 3.1.d regulates the incorporation of the Catalan language to all those areas of
learning and the contribution to the process of standardisation of the scientific, cultural and
social use of Catalan as one of the objectives of the Catalan university system. This law
also establishes the obligation of the Catalan Government, through the Inter-university
Council, to ensure that the access and the incorporation of new members to the university
community do not alter the normal linguistic use and the linguistic standardisation process
of the universities.

With respect to foreign students, a linguistic reception scheme has been planned together
with the establishment of systems which will promote a sufficient level of understanding in
Catalan among those seeking to enter Catalan universities.

In this area the legal structure is completed by the regulation of the linguistic rights of
teaching staff and students established in Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy
(Article 22.1) which specifically states that both the teaching staff and the students have
the right to express themselves, in all events in the official language which they prefer.
This law also establishes that the government and the universities must adopt the
necessary measures to foster the use of Catalan in all areas of teaching activities, nonteaching activities and investigation.
254

The Activity of Promoting Catalan in the Catalan University Sector

The following subsidies which are awarded by the Government of Catalonia seek to fulfil
this objective through:
•

Subsidies to the universities of Catalonia for projects and activities of linguistic

standardisation (NORMA). The NORMA convocation awards subsidies in the
universities of Catalonia using linguistic services as direct beneficiaries, for projects
and activities of linguistic standardisation of Catalan. This comprises 3 types of subsidy
•

For linguistic standardisation initiatives, which are understood to be actions

or projects which seek to encourage and foster the understanding and use of
Catalan in universities (plans of linguistic dynamisation, the development of
resources or products in Catalan which are applicable to the TIC, terminological
resources, etc.)
•

To Catalan language courses for the linguistic reception of foreign students.

•

To the maintenance and the updating of Catalan language self-learning

spaces for teaching staff and students.
•

Subsidies to publishing companies for the publication and the distribution of

textbooks or university manuals or scientific books in paper or digital format, which are
written in Catalan (DILL).
•

Subsidies to doctorate students for the fostering of Catalan in doctoral theses

(TDCAT). In 2008 sixty-two requests were presented, all of which have received the
above-mentioned subsidy.

University linguistic services are highly important media for promoting the use of Catalan:
they receive the support of the government and their function is to offer the teaching of
Catalan to the university community, to promote its use in teaching and to undertake
dynamisation activities in the use of the language of the country among students. In
addition to support for the linguistic services of the universities, the Government of
Catalonia subsidises self-learning centres located in Catalan universities, and offers
didactic support to those managing these centres, it subsidises projects and activities in
the linguistic standardisation of universities, it subsidises the publication of university
manuals and other teaching materials in the Catalan language in addition to materials and
actions related to the learning of Catalan which are mainly focused on the university
255

community. The Catalan Government also economically supports university education in
the area of Catalan language. As such, the Office of Linguistic Policy of Universities and
Investigation has dealt with the coordination and updating of the Intercat multimedia
platform. This platform is the result of the cooperation between the delegate and Catalan
universities which consists in a series of electronic resources on a website; didactic
materials, sociolinguistic documents, information on linguistic volunteer projects, etc., for
introduction to the Catalan language and culture and which has been specifically designed
especially for visiting students in the universities of Catalonia.

The Use of Catalan in Entrance Exams for Catalan Universities

Catalan is the language which is used the most by far in the entrance exams for Catalan
universities. The following chart shows the percentage use of Catalan and Spanish in
these exams and reveals a stability in the highest level figures (around 94%) with respect
to the use of Catalan:

This data reveals that those students who wish to enter university have a high level of
linguistic competence in Catalan and that they use this language as a vehicular language
in education.

Catalan in University Teaching

256

Teaching in Catalan is fixed at around 60%, with a downward trend, it must be noted that
despite the legal stipulations given at the beginning of this section, the lack of normative
deployment regulations has clearly made this policy unenforceable, with respect to
required competence in Catalan for the selection of university teaching staff until now. In
this sense, the Agreement of June 2008 of the Board of the Inter-university Council of
Catalonia is positive news, with respect to the linguistic accreditation in the processes of
selection and the access by teaching staff of the universities of the Catalan university
system. This agreement established in general terms (as exceptions exist) that permanent
university teaching staff must provide proof of their understanding of the Catalan language
in order to accede to a teaching position in a Catalan university.

Sub-paragraph f, i): to make provisions so that courses for adult education or continual
education are undertaken mainly or totally in the regional or minority languages;

Adult Training Centres in Catalonia

Decree 213/2002 of the 1st of August which establishes the curricular organisation of
basic adult education, establishes in Article 5, that Catalan is the vehicular language and
language of learning for the instrumental teaching cycle and the secondary cycle of adult
education, and as such fulfils the undertaking of the provisions in Law 1/1998 in this area.

The adult education programmes promoted by the Catalan Government include therefore,
actions for learning the Catalan language as a vehicle of integration in Catalan society,
with a twin objective:
•

To guarantee literacy in Catalan for adult immigrants.

•

To promote the initial teaching of oral and written language for new arrivals.

257

Catalan is therefore the vehicular and learning language of adult education centres and
classes which depend on the Sub-General Directorate of Adult Education of the
Department of Education. Multiple initiatives in teaching Catalan are undertaken, both for
newly-arrived adults who have no knowledge of Catalan language and for those who need
to improve and extend their knowledge of Catalan.

The Department of Education has one hundred and twenty-three centres or teaching
classes for adults throughout Catalonia, offering flexible teaching which is adapted to the
needs and interests of adults in different time slots in the morning, afternoon and at night.
The offer of the centres and classes for adult education prioritises the learning of Catalan
with courses of linguistic reception and basic level courses which are aimed at new
arrivals. The table below shows the distribution of course registrations (7,724) at different
Catalan teaching levels in the centres and classes of adult education for the 2008-2009
course.

The Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation (CPNL)

The CPNL is a body which was created as a result of the voluntary incorporation of the
different levels of those administrative bodies (the Catalan government and the local
administrative bodies) which exist in the territory, in order to offer the public an opportunity
to learn Catalan, dynamize the economic sector and provide assessment and support in
the use of Catalan. There are 22 centres located throughout the territory, covering this
entire area and which have been operational since 1989.

The Catalan educational courses for adults offered by the CPNL in the years which
concern this report have increased have been diversified and have been adapted to the
needs of a continually growing demand, with more courses, more agents and the
258

7,724

publication of specific materials. New programmes (intermediate levels) and new tests are
an example of the continued effort of the CPNL for improving the quality of the education
offered, while considering European references, the methodology and the contents of the
Common European Framework of reference of the EU: communicative education,
education through tasks and continued evaluation.

Registrations for Catalan courses have experienced an overall growth of 22% between
2007 and 2008. In 2007 there was an increase of 17% with respect to 2006. The
accumulated increase in the triennium was 43%, with a total of more than 280,000
registrations.

The online course parla.cat www.parla.cat, was also developed during this period, this
course projects a future in which teaching capacities may experience a quantum leap.

During the 2007-2008 period the CPNL offered a total of 4,582 class courses for which
there were 100,441 registrations. There was an increase of 759 courses from a total of
3,823 courses, with respect to the previous period. Furthermore, 9,668 students followed
distance-learning courses and 1,226 followed a self-learning process in a self-learning
centre. This results in a total number of 111,335 registrations, a 22% increase with respect
to the previous course. It must also be noted that the number of foreigners who registered
for Catalan courses has risen from 48,098 to 64,569, which is an increase of 60%.

The following table shows the number of courses organised by the CPNL during the 20052008, by levels:

The Offer of Catalan Language Courses at Initial and Basic Levels of the Consortium for
Linguistic Standardisation

With respect to courses held in classes, over the last few years, the Government of
Catalonia has made a considerable effort to attend to people who do not speak Catalan as
a first language, especially those who have arrived here recently; this has promoted an
important increase in the number of courses offered by the Consortium for Linguistic
Standardisation. This increase is especially apparent in the initial and basic level courses,
which are provided free of charge, as one of the main strategies for increasing the number
of people who learn Catalan.

Initial level courses aim to facilitate first contact with the spoken language, while the basic
level courses are aimed at non-Catalan speakers who wish to understand Catalan and
begin speaking it.

The following table shows development in terms of student origin in initial and basic level
courses and the graph reflects the origins of foreign students during the 2005-2008 period:

Distance Learning

Another learning method offered by the CPNL is that of distance-learning courses. The
number of students who have followed this manner of learning Catalan has increased in a
highly notable manner, although in recent courses this figure has stabilised. In a general
manner it may be stated that the offer of distance learning courses has been well-received
and has been established in a large part of the territory. The Parla.cat course will help to
increase these types of courses in a noteworthy manner.

Self-learning Centres

Another important resource which facilitates the learning of Catalan is Catalan selflearning centres. This type of learning is aimed at students with a certain level of
independence in their learning process and has become established as an alternative and
complementary model for class-based education in a significant manner.

There are currently some ninety self-learning centres which are mainly located in
Catalonia and the Catalan linguistic area. The majority of these centres have been created
with the cooperation of the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy which has undertaken
monitoring and coordination, as well as the provision of the teaching and support
materials. Those institutions which have Catalan self-learning centres are: universities, the
Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation, institutes of secondary education belonging to
the Department of Education, official language schools, adult training schools, penitentiary
centres, etc.

The Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation offers services and resources for selflearning through a stable network of centres and services. In 2008 services were offered
through the eleven open, operational centres. In addition to the eleven open centres,
students following the courses and the population as a whole, have been able to improve
their understanding of Catalan through those self-learning materials which are available in
the open services.

The open services are often located in public libraries and resource centres, and have a
262

selection of self-learning materials for open centres available for use. A total of 1,226
students have followed an independent process for learning Catalan through the offer of
the open centres and services.

With respect to training aimed at the professional group of self-learning professionals, the
main initiative is the annual centre meeting. In 2008, in the 14th Meeting of Self-Learning
Centres, professionals took part from Catalonia, the Valencian Community, the Balearic
Islands, the French Department of the Eastern Pyrenees, Andorra, the Basque Country,
Navarre and Madrid. Organisation was undertaken by the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy in
cooperation with the CPNL.

The Teaching of Catalan to Immigrant Religious Groups

The Department of the Vice presidency, through the General Directorate of Religious
Affairs is undertaking the Programme for Fostering the Understanding of Social Reality
and the Catalan Language by Religious Leaders of Immigrants, which is included in the
2005-2008 Citizenship and Immigration Plan. In 2006 the Government of Catalonia and
the Islamic and Cultural Council of Catalonia signed a participatory agreement between
both bodies on actions to foster dialogue and mutual understanding between Islam and
Catalan society, which was renewed in the same terms in 2007.

Independently of these agreements, the General Directorate of Religious Affairs has
promoted training courses in the Catalan language and the understanding of the social
reality of Catalonia for Muslim imams who undertake their tasks in Catalan territory,
through the Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation, which has held courses for imams
since 2002.

sub-paragraph g: to take measures to ensure the teaching of the history and culture
which the regional or minority language is an expression of;

In all the curricular itineraries of the different levels of education detailed in the previous
sections, the teaching of Catalan history and culture is included.

sub-paragraph h: to guarantee the initial and continual training of the teaching staff
necessary for the application of paragraphs a) to g) which the party has accepted;
263

In conformity with that established in Article 24 of the Law on Linguistic Policy of 1998,
teaching staff must understand the two official languages (Catalan and Spanish) and they
must be able to use them in their teaching work. According to Decree 244/1991 of 28
October, on the understanding of the official languages of Catalan and Spanish for the
provision of teaching positions in non-university public teaching centres in Catalonia which
depend on the Department of Education, in the competitions for the transfer of teaching
staff, a level of Catalan with the training certificate (Module II) or a level of a sufficient
understanding of Catalan (Level C) is required.

In the same manner, the above-mentioned Law on Linguistic Policy, in Article 22.3,
establishes that universities must offer courses and suitable means so that students and
teaching staff may improve their comprehension and their understanding of Catalan. One
of the functions of university linguistic services is to offer Catalan courses to the teaching
staff and to foster its use in teaching.

sub-paragraph i: to create one or several control bodies responsible with the monitoring
of the adopted measures and of the progress made in the establishment or development
of the teaching of the regional or minority languages and to write periodical reports which
will be made public.

As stated in the previous report, in the teaching centres of Catalonia, Catalan is normally
used as the language of non-university education and the understanding of Catalan is
systematically evaluated at all levels.

paragraph 2: With respect to education and to territories distinct from those in which the
regional or minority languages are traditionally spoken, the parties agree to authorise,
foster or establish if the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies the
teaching of or in the language at levels which are considered appropriate.

The Ramon Llull Institute (IRL) has as its main objective the overseas projection of Catalan
language and culture and it undertakes its activities through the areas of language, creation,
humanities and science.

264

The IRL, promotes the presence, the study and the learning of Catalan and its reality in
universities and other centres around the world through the area of language. As such it
facilitates those linguistic and teaching resources necessary for the study of the Catalan
language, it encourages the training of teaching staff specialised in the teaching of Catalan
as a foreign language and holds and administrates exams for the attainment of certificates of
knowledge of Catalan outside the linguistic domain.

Teaching Catalan Abroad

The IRL is responsible for the promoting the teaching of Catalan language and literature in
universities and other centres of advanced studies outside the linguistic domain. It also
facilitates linguistic and educational resources for learning, research or work with Catalan,
and provides assessment for promoting the training of teaching staff specialised in teaching
Catalan as a foreign language.

The University Network of Catalan Studies

With respect to the teaching of Catalan in the university area, during the 2007-8 academic
course, 124 universities in 31 countries around the world formed the university network of
Catalan studies, a total of 7,666 students follow studies of Catalan language and literature in
these centres. The table below details the number of universities which offered Catalan
studies during the 2007-20008 course and the countries.

The Ramón Llull Institute continues to promote the grants programme for students of Catalan
in order to facilitate attendance to Catalan language courses which are undertaken within the
linguistic domain.

In Spain, outside of those areas where Catalan is spoken, Catalan language university
courses may be taken in 11 universities. The Ramón Llull Institute subsidises Catalan studies
in four of these universities (Vigo, Santiago de Compostela, Alcalá de Henares and the
University of Distance Learning (Universidad de Educación a Distancia).

University Chairs and Catalan Study Centres

In order to encourage the study and investigation of Catalan language and culture outside the
linguistic domain, the IRL encourages the maintenance and the creation of centres for the
study of Catalan language and culture in several universities. Throughout the 2006-2008
period, the IRL has fostered the undertaking of academic and cultural activities in overseas
universities through the financing or the co-financing of projects presented by different
universities.

Finally, it must be noted that the following university chairs and Catalan study centres which
are financed by the Ramón Llull Institute are operational in 2008:
The Centre of Catalan Studies of the University of the Sorbonne, Paris
The Centre of Investigation in Catalan Studies of Queen Mary University, London

268

The Study of Catalan Investigation of the University of Frankfurt
The Joan Coromines Chair of Catalan Studies, of the University of Chicago
The London School of Economics and Political Science, of London
The University of Stanford

Catalan Communities Overseas

The IRL also promotes the teaching of Catalan in non-university areas, with activities aimed
at the public in general, especially where the existence of Catalan communities or historical.
cultural or commercial relations make it more necessary. With this aim subsidies for
associations and bodies outside the linguistic domain are still held for the organisation of
Catalan language courses.

The Agreement with the Cervantes Institute

In September 2004, the IRL signed a cooperative agreement with the Cervantes Institute
which depends on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and by virtue of which the
latter agreed to teach classes of Catalan and to hold acts organised by the IRL in its centres.
As a continuation of this cooperative agreement, in 2007 30 Catalan language courses were
held in 13 centres of the Cervantes Institute, which were attended by 170 students. During
2008 Catalan language courses were offered in Cervantes Institute centres in Bremen,
Bucharest, Leeds, Manchester, Moscow, Munich, New York, Paris and Rome.

Conferences and Student Teaching Placements

The RLI promotes cooperation with entities and organisations which organise teaching
activities in order to extend the understanding of Catalan for those who are taught outside of
the Catalan linguistic domain. Thus, for example, in the period which concerns us, the IRL
cooperated on an annual basis in the organisation of the University Campuses of the Catalan
language, the International Conferences on Catalan Language and Culture and
Austrian/Catalan Conferences.

Assessment and Training for Teaching Staff

269

Among its functions, the IRL promotes the training of teaching staff who are specialised in the
teaching of Catalan as a second language and who work outside the Catalan linguistic area.
With this objective, activities such as teacher training courses were organised between 2006
and 2008; “Catalan as a Foreign Language: Tools and Strategies (Barcelona)”, International
Conferences for Teaching Staff of Catalan (Barcelona), Improvement Courses for Catalan
Teachers in the Southern Cone of America (Parana) and the Teacher Training Course for
Teaching Staff of Catalan “Casals” (a traditional body specific to areas where Catalan is
spoken, with cultural, recreational, political or religious objectives) of Europe (Lausanne).

Teacher training and the support provided to teachers also involved personalised attention in
consultations and the preparation and delivery of specific teaching materials.

Tools and Materials for Learning

With respect to tools and materials for the teaching of Catalan, it must be noted that during
this period the participation of the IRL has continued in the project for the creation of the
online Catalan course Parla.cat, which is the result of a cooperative agreements between the
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Government of Catalonia and the Ramon Llull Institute.
The two first levels were opened to the public in 2008 and work has continued on the upper
levels and in the improvement of the platform’s functions.

Parla.cat is a multilingual environment. All the information which is used through the working
platform is accessible in Catalan, Spanish, English, French and German. In the basic level
teaching units statements and instructions have also been translated into these languages in
addition to theoretical content and the intervention of a virtual assistant.

Furthermore, the IRL has continued to provide subsidies and grants for the overseas
promotion of Catalan and the teaching of Catalan abroad.

The Evaluation of Knowledge of Catalan Abroad

The IRL is the body which evaluates the understanding of Catalan outside the linguistic
domain and to do this it holds and administrates exams which verify progress in self-learning
while it regulates and issues certificates which do not correspond to regulated teaching
procedures.
270

The IRL has organised examinations for certificates which verify an understanding of
Catalan outside the linguistic domain.

Associations, Entities and Institutions of Catalan Studies

The IRL supports and encourages Catalan study bodies which bring together students and
experts of Catalan language and literature who are educated or resident outside the linguistic
domain.

The Divulgation of Catalan Overseas

With the aim of disseminating Catalan language and its reality, the IRL participates in the
main state and international trade fairs and exhibitions which are related to language and
language learning and which facilitate information with respect to learning and improving
Catalan by means of traditional courses, audiovisual methods, placements and linguistic
conferences, etc. In the same way, the IRL complements its participation in fairs and
exhibitions with the organisation of activities, such as conferences or round tables to publicise
new events or projects of interest while publicising the situation of Catalan or determined
actions of linguistic policy.

Courses Organised by the Delegation of the Government of Catalonia in Madrid

Each year the Delegation of the Government of Catalonia in Madrid organises Catalan
courses which are aimed at the population in general. During the years which concern this
report (the 2006-2008 triennium) the courses detailed in the following table have been
organised:

The Application of Article 9

Paragraph 1. The parties agree, with respect to that which refers to the area divisions of
the judicial authorities in which the number of persons who reside there and who speak the
regional or minority languages justifies the following specific measures, according to the
situation of each one of these languages and on condition that the court does not consider
that the use of the possibilities offered in this paragraph constitutes an obstacle for the
proper administration of justice:
•

In penal procedures:

sub-paragraph a.i): to ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties undertake the procedure in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph a, ii): to guarantee the accused the right to express him/her self in his /
her regional or minority language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iii): to ensure that the demands and the proof, be they written or orally
communicated are not considered negligible for the sole motive that they are written in a
regional or minority language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iv): to draw up in the aforementioned regional or minority languages, on
request, the documents pertaining to a judicial procedure, recurring, where necessary to
interpreters and translations without additional expenses for the interested parties;

b) in civil procedures:
sub-paragraph b, i): to ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, at the request of one of the
parties undertake the procedure in the regional or minority languages; and/or
sub-paragraph b, ii): to permit, when a party in a legal dispute has to appear in person
before a court, that he /she may express him /her self in his /her regional or minority
language without having to incur additional expenses in doing so; and/or

272

sub-paragraph b, iii): to permit the presentation of documents and proof in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary using the services of interpreters and translations

c) in procedures before courts with jurisdiction in administrative matters:
sub-paragraph c, i): to ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties undertake the procedure in the regional or minority languages; and/or
sub-paragraph c, ii): to permit, when a party in a legal dispute has to appear in person
before a court, that he /she may express him /her self in his /her regional or minority
language without having to incur additional expenses in doing so; and/or

sub-paragraph c, iii): to permit the presentation of documents and proof in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary using the services of interpreters and translations;

sub-paragraph d: to adopt measures so that the application of sections i) and iii) of
paragraphs b) and c) above and the use, where applicable of interpreters and translations
do not incur additional expenses for the interested parties.

The EAC establishes that all persons, in their relations with the Department of Justice, the
Public Prosecution Service, notaries and public registries have the right to use the official
language which they choose in all legal procedures and to receive all the official
documentation issued in Catalan in the language requested, without lack of proper defence
nor undue delay due to the language used, nor can any type of translation be requested from
them (Article 33.2).

In order to guarantee the rights of linguistic option, the statute establishes that judges,
magistrates, prosecutors, notaries and registrars of property and companies responsible for
civil registration and the staff of the Department of Justice must verify in the manner
established by the law, that they have an appropriate and sufficient level of understanding of
the official languages which makes them suitable for the performance of the duties pertaining
to their office or employment in order to provide their services in Catalonia.

However, with respect to the judiciary, the lack of reform with respect to basic state
regulations have impeded the practical application of the above-mentioned 2006 Statute of
Autonomy of Catalonia 2006, which, as was previously mentioned, has been the subject of a
273

sentence of the Constitutional Court motivated by a challenge to the statute. The sentence
supports the provisions relating to the Department of Justice in Catalonia, with the exception
of that which corresponds to the Council of Justice of Catalonia, on considering that the
statute is not a competent regulation for establishing its full regulation.

Linguistic Use in the Justice Department of Catalonia.

Despite that stated above, it must be said that the understanding of Catalan by the staff of
the judicial offices has been shown to be sufficient, a fact declared by the secretaries of the
judicial offices themselves in an official survey undertaken by the Government of Catalonia
through the Statistical Institute of Catalonia. The 2008 Survey on Linguistic Use in the
Department of Justice is part of the Statistics on Linguistic Uses of Institutions and
Companies, which is included in recent statistical plans approved by the Parliament of
Catalonia.

The aim of this survey is to reveal the linguistic customs and attitudes used in the judicial
bodies of Catalonia. It is a quantitative study which uses the personal interviews made of
judicial secretaries from all the judicial organisations in Catalonia (with a total of 559 judicial
offices, of which 550 have been subject to interviews), in civil, penal, administrative litigation,
employment and mixed areas. The field work was undertaken in the months of October and
November of 2008.

A summarised selection of the results obtained in the survey with respect to the use of
Catalan and Spanish is detailed below in distinct working areas.

litigation.

With respect to judges, magistrates and prosecutors, as this is a state-administrated body,
there is a constant flow of personnel from other parts of Spain. The efforts of the Government
of Catalonia centre on guaranteeing access to training in the Catalan language for all the
judges, magistrates, judicial secretaries, prosecutors and civil servants in general who may
require it. It also offers technical support with staff from the Catalan administration who
provide their services through a territorial network.
277

All of this is part of the linguistic reception which the Department of Justice of the
Government of Catalonia undertakes for high-level civil servants from the day they begin their
professional tasks in Catalonia and which combines awareness measures and the
dissemination of the linguistic rights of the public, the provision of technical linguistic
resources which are facilitated by automatic translation, specialised online terminology and
training through self-learning courses, together with tutorials and the technical support of
linguistic dynamisation staff who visit each judge and prosecutor in their new workplace and
offer assistance and support for the use of Catalan in their judicial district.

This initiative, which provides information, awareness training and dynamisation, comprises
linguistic reception which is provided from the first day at work and during the rest of the time
in which the employee works in Catalonia and is highly important as it allows Catalan to be
used freely in the judicial offices of Catalonia without delays or pauses. In this respect it must
be noted that Catalan is the language used by the security forces of the Government of
Catalonia and also by Catalan public administration bodies, such that the documents which
both of the above send to the courts is written in Catalan, which means that contact with the
language is immediate in the exercise of their responsibilities in Catalonia.

The following table shows, taking 2008 as an example, the figures for translations and
corrections of judicial documents into Catalan undertaken by the staff of the Government of
Catalonia:

The Provision of Education in Catalan for Staff from the Department of Justice in Catalonia:

With respect to the high level of linguistic competence in Catalan language shown by the staff
in the service of the Department of Justice in Catalonia, it must be noted that their
understanding is taken into account in employment allocation and that furthermore, for those
employees who have not been previously accredited, the Government of Catalonia
guarantees the provision of training in Catalan language specifically designed for staff in the
service of the Department of Justice in Catalonia. The following tables show the registration
figures at the different levels during the three-year period covered by this report:

Catalan in the Language of the Documentation received by the Courts:

Between 70% and 80% of the documents which are sent to the courts by different public
organisations are in Catalan. This includes documents from the security forces, the
Department of Justice and other public administration bodies.

However the documentation received from private professionals in the legal sector
(lawyers, solicitors) is of a reverse proportion as only 27.4% is written in Catalan.

This is due to the lack of the historical presence of Catalan in the university teaching of
Law, which means that, despite the high level of Catalan possessed by professionals in

282

Catalonia, ignorance remains with respect to specialised language and the free linguistic
resources available for attaining this level of understanding.

In order to increase the amount of documents which the courts receive in Catalan, in late
2008 the Government of Catalonia began a programme of institutional cooperation with
the professional colleges of the legal sector. This stable, co-operational framework must
allow the joint action of the Catalan government and the professional sector itself to
promote the linguistic resources which the government makes freely available to the
professional sector, the specialised linguistic training which they are also provided with
free, and last but not least, the co-responsibility of the professional sector in making its
members aware of the change of scenario which has occurred: the defence of the right to
linguistic choice for each professional and the awareness that the exercise of this right
does not prejudice the party they legally represent.

As such a Structural Cooperative Agreement has been signed with the Bar Council of
Catalonia, which establishes a stable channel for cooperation in the promotion of Catalan
and the diffusion and awareness of the right of professionals in the legal sector to
undertake their duties in Catalan. This agreement establishes that a joint monitoring
committee of the Bar Council of Catalonia and the Government of Catalonia (through the
Department of Justice and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy) will establish a working plan
every year, with initiatives adjusted to the objectives of the agreement and which will
evaluate, using the pre-established indicators, the results of previous initiatives. The text of
the

agreement

After 8 months of undertaking the 2009 Working Plan with the Bar Council of Catalonia, it
must be noted that success in terms of the participation of legal sector professionals in the
initiatives included in the plan, which are detailed below, have surpassed expectations:

-

The assessment and personalised tutoring of law firms for the transition to the use

of Catalan in their work: this comprises the translation models of documents, the
assessment of staff in the use of translation and consultation resources the online
learning of legal language in Catalan and their monitoring during one year. 135 law

283

firms have requested applied to benefit from this advice during the first six months of
the implementation of the Working Plan.
-

Catalan distance courses, with tutoring for lawyers, with special emphasis on legal

terminology. More than 600 users were registered during the first 6 months of
application.
-

Free user licences for all professional associations for the use of the automatic

Spanish-Catalan-Spanish translation software.
-

A website of useful resources for the profession in Catalan: translated established

legislation, models of legal documents, specialist terminology online, etc.
-

The translation of university manuals used in Law Faculties.

-

Awareness conferences on the lack of current obstacles for the use of Catalan in

legal proceedings.
Given the success of the experience, cooperative agreements are now being made with
other professional associations in the sector (notaries, prosecutors, property registrars,
etc.).

Jurisprudence enacted during this Triennium with Respect to the Freedom of Linguistic
Choice in Legal Proceedings

It must be noted that the Administrative Division of the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia,
in its session of 4 September 2007 adopted a resolution which it declared indisputable under
applicable legislation, of the right of any member of the public who participates in legal
proceedings undertaken in Catalonia to use the official language which he/she chooses in
accordance with the right to linguistic choice as recognised in the statute. This resolution also
recognised the right of members of the public to receive all official documentation issued in
Catalonia in the language requested, in addition to the testimonies of the judgements and the
adjudicative acts which affect them without delay to reasons of language.

It must also be noted that the sentence of 24 April 2008 of the Penal Division of the High
Court nullified a sentence as it infringed the fundamental right to defence (the fundamental
question being that of an alleged crime against the crown), as the judge did not authorise the
intervention of an interpreter of Catalan language who would have allowed the court to
understand the declarations of the accused which were made in Catalan. The sentence
concluded that the choice to make a statement in a maternal language corresponds
exclusively to the defendant in the exercise of public right to self-defence, a very personal
284

right established in Article 24 of the Constitution and that the courts, like all public authorities,
and in accordance with the commandment of Article 3 of the core text, have to respect and
protect the Spanish languages in a special manner and not only Spanish, the official
language of the state.

The General Department of the State, the Ministry of Justice reports that the use of Catalan
in legal proceedings undertaken in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia takes place in
approximately 30% of all cases.

Paragraph 2: The parties agree to:

sub-paragraph a: not reject the validity of legal documents drawn up within the state area
for the sole reason that they have been drafted in a regional or minority language;

Catalan Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy guarantees in Article 14, the right to
choose the language which they wish public documents which are pertinent to their
procedures to be written in (Spanish or Catalan).

Law 204/1998 of 30 July regulates the use of the Catalan and Occitan language in legal
documents, developing this legal provision. The regulation is detailed with respect to the
choice of the language, validity in the event of doubts when interpreting both versions, the
copies to be issued, etc. The following have been noted from among its provisions:

Article 1
-

In Catalonia legal documents must be written in the official language chosen by the
grantor, or if there is more than one grantor, in a language which the grantors agree
upon.

-

Before drafting the document and on receiving the order to draft it, the grantor or
grantors or their representatives must be explicitly asked which language they choose;
on no account can the choice of one or another language result in the delay in the
drafting and authorisation of the document. If the language is not expressly chosen, the
document will be drawn up in Catalan.

-

When there is more than one grantor and deeds for the transference of property or
rights or for the constitution of a loan or credit made following the general conditions of

285

contract law, the right to choose the language corresponds to the purchaser or
borrower.
Article 2
1.

Without prejudice to that established in Article 1.3, if no agreement is made between
the grantors with respect to language, the deeds are granted in both official
languages.

Under this legal regulation a sustained, albeit modest increase in the presence of Catalan
has been registered in the documentation authorised by notaries in Catalonia, as shown in
the table below:

This autonomous legislation, which was passed in 1998, has been added to the basic
state regulations as the new Regulation on the Organisation and Structure of Notary
Procedures, which was approved by Royal Decree 45/2007 of 19 January, and establishes
in Articles 149 and 150 identical conditions of free choice for the official language in each
territory in which public documents are executed before a notary. This, when transferred to
the territory of Catalonia, after the 2006 Statute, results in the possibility of choosing
between Spanish, Catalan and Occitan, especially in the Aran region.

286

Furthermore, the EAC attributes executive power, with respect to state notaries to the
Government of Catalonia, which includes jurisdiction with respect to the provision of work
places and the establishment of regulations for the accreditation of an understanding of
Catalan for the provision of notaries.

As such, the Government of Catalonia, in the first convocation held in the exercise of this
power for the provision of notary vacancies in Catalonia (Resolution JUS/310/2008 of 7
February) established as a requirement for participants in the contest, the need to prove
that the office of the notary with a vacancy which the participants were interested in, will be
in conditions to attend to the public in any of the two official languages in addition to having
staff who have an appropriate and sufficient knowledge of these languages in order to
carry out the proper duties of their workplace. To this purpose the proof of an
understanding of Catalan must be made when submitting the application to participate in
the contest and may be made in any of the following manners:
•

The participant (the notary) must have a language level which corresponds to the B or
C certificate of Catalan from the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy (corresponding to levels
B2 and C1 of the Common European Framework of Refernce for Languages, MECR),
or

•

equivalent.

A sworn declaration or formal declaration that the person participating in the contest
agrees to employ personnel contracted with the professional category of legal official
with a certificate for Level C in Catalan from the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy (C1 of
the MECR).

With the aim of facilitating the maximum fulfilment of the linguistic requirements, the
Government of Catalonia, through the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy and the Department
of Justice, together with the College of Notaries of Catalonia, are finalising a Partnership
Framework Agreement which will guarantee access to free training in Catalan for notaries
and staff employed by them for their offices in an online self-learning system. It will also be
facilitating numerous types of online linguistic resources relating to notarial documents and
terminology used in the professional area of the law.

287

paragraph 3: The parties are obliged to facilitate the most important national legislative
texts and especially those which refer to the speakers of the above-mentioned languages,
unless the these texts are already available in another form.

Catalan in Official Legal Publications and in Legislative Texts

By agreement with the state body of the Official State Gazette (BOE), since 1998 the
translators of the Official Gazette of the Catalan Government have translated the most
important legal provisions into Catalan (laws, regulations, and also community directives
and provisions which specifically refer to Catalonia), for publication in the special
supplement in Catalan of the BOE (Official State Gazette). The above-mentioned state
body bears the cost of the publication and the distribution in addition to 50% of the
translation costs which are borne by Catalonia.

To facilitate the use of Catalan by legal practitioners, the Catalan Government has
promoted the LexCat project, which consists in the online publication of the current
regulations established in Catalan. This public initiative seeks to compensate for the
existing market gaps and allow competition on equal terms for Catalan and Spanish in
work opportunities in the legal sector, such that the existing provision of the regulation in
Spanish is added to the provision of the regulation established in Catalan by the Catalan
government.
The LexCat project was started in 2006, and since then legal titles have gradually been
added to public regulations published on the Department of Justice website. The published
regulations are entirely in Catalan, the texts are updated every day and notes are added
with information on reform laws.
In order to establish an order of priorities, the potential users of the service were consulted
(legal professionals, lawyers, law lecturers, etc.) on the legislative texts which would be
more useful for their work. Using this as a basis laws in Catalan have been added
progressively. The texts are solely in Catalan, or they have been translated by the
linguistic services of the department or they are from the Catalan language supplement of
the Official State Gazette (BOE), which has been published since 1998.
As well as the publication of the legislative texts online, the publication of paper format
texts has also begun, which complements that offered through the website.

In addition to legal material in Catalan, the Government of Catalonia has made various
legal materials available to legal professionals in Catalan (those related to Article 9 of the
European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages: the Manual of Judicial Language,
the vocabulary of criminal law, criminal proceedings and penal law, a dictionary of civil law,
etc.) in addition to I.T. resources to facilitate the use of Catalan, such as automatic
Spanish-Catalan translation software, in addition to diverse material for consultation and
Internet-accessible assessment). In this sense must also be noted that the Government of
Catalonia has contributed to the financing of the linguistic services of the professional
colleges of lawyers, especially for the translation of legal texts into Catalan and for the
availability of an automatic translation program which it is hoped will be provided free and
open to all legal professionals next year.

The Overall Evaluation of the Application of Article 9 CELROM

In this section it must be noted that there has been, with regard to the previous triennium,
a highly important advance in the immediacy of the Catalan publication of the Official State
Gazette (BOE) with respect to the Spanish version.

289

Until well into 2006, there were entire months of difference between the Spanish and
Catalan versions of legal provisions and of certain regulatory provisions; today the joint
effort of the Official State Gazette and the Official Journal of the Catalan Government,
which provides translation services has ensured that a lapse of only half a week now
separates the Spanish from the Catalan version of the BOE.

The Application of Article 10
Paragraph 1. In the districts of the administrative authorities of the state, in which the
number of speakers of regional or minority languages which justifies the measures
detailed below and in accordance with the situation of each language, the parties, to the
extent that they are reasonably able, agree:

Sub-paragraph a, i): to ensure that these administrative authorities use the regional or
minority languages;

Sub-paragraph b: to make frequently used forms and administrative texts available to the
public in the regional or minority languages, or in bilingual versions;

Sub-paragraph c: to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a regional
or minority language.

With respect to the distinct ministries, the use of Catalan in the General Department of the
State is detailed below separately.

•

Ministry of the Presidency

Standardised forms available to citizens in bilingual or co-official language
versions.

In Catalonia more than 65% of printed documents and forms are presented to the public in
bilingual or double version. Deficiencies occur as certain standardised printed documents
of the state are distributed from central services. Attempts are being made to resolve this
situation as soon as possible.
290

As examples of models in co-official languages the following are mentioned:

The Centre of Sociological Investigations (CIS) provides 25% of its leaflets for surveys in
Catalan (some 10,000).

The General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) will produce 10
publications in Catalan in 2010. This organisation will also produce informative leaflets
relating to questions on its activity which are published in Spanish and in the co-official
languages. These publications are edited in both printed and digital format and are
available on the web page of the MUFACE. To date, the normal amount of printed editions
for this type of publication is:
• 900,000 printed editions in Spanish
• 10,000 printed editions in Catalan
The magazine of the General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants is currently in a
process of redefinition, which will result in a significant reduction in the number of printed
editions and further support for the virtual version of the magazine. Examples in all the coofficial languages are included in the 2010 publications plan. Examples of the subjects
anticipated (in both printed and online versions are:
• A diptych of the charter of electronic services (60,000 in Spanish, 10,000 in
Catalan)
• A four-page leaflet of the charter of services of the General Insurance Group of
State Civil Servants (20,000 in all the languages, 550,000 in Spanish, 10,000 in

The Level of Accessibility of Web Pages in the Co-official Language

The pages of the 060.es (www.060.es) web page on general information regarding
administrative services are available in the distinct co-official languages. The website has
its home page, the secondary pages and all the elements required for searching (title
menus, menus for secondary pages, left and right menus) in the co-official languages. The
new 060 website will have the same structure and the progressive translation of contents
into the co-official languages and English is planned.

On the www.la-moncloa.es web page the static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles)
are all translated, as is information of a permanent character.

In the www.mpr.es web page the static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles) are all
translated into the co-official languages, as is information of a permanent character, to the
first level of web navigation, in accord with that established by the guide for the editing and
publication of the web pages of the General Department of the State, which establishes as
a general criteria, the translation of static documents, general information and those
documents which require little modification and/or updating.
•

The State Agency for the Evaluation of Public Policies and the Quality of Services
(AEVAL) has presented the following results:

•

There is a total level of accessibility, meaning that a duplicate website exists for
each one of the co-official languages, with an independent home page.

•

With respect to content:
-

The static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles) are all translated.

295

-

Those sections relating to institutional information of a theoretical or doctrinal

character regarding matters pertaining to agency activities are translated to the
final level of website navigation: 40% of all pages.
-

Mixed translation (the first level in the co-official language and the following

levels in Spanish) in documents which occasionally have variable sections
(quality permit, annual evaluations, etc.): 30% of all pages.
-

Not translated into the co-official languages are all those pages relating to

the news, events or adverts, or which are continually updated. 30% of all pages.

In the Official State Gazette (BOE):

-

Web pages (static and organisational content): All the web

The Centre of Policy and Constitutional Studies (CEPC) is in the process of

adapting their web page through the translation into the co-official languages of static
and organisational elements in addition to those of other contents of interest.
•

The web page of the Centre of Sociological Investigation (CIS) (research and
statistics statistics) are translated into the co-official languages:

•

All web pages in HTML

•

The non-validated online request forms which need to be printed and sent.

•

The form for downloading micro-data.

♦ That which refers to the web page of the National Institute of Public Administration
Bodies.

Given that the information facilitated is applicable for a brief period, due to its rapid
creation, and that the translations are undertaken by contracted specialist companies
into those official languages different from Spanish and into English, the contents
gathered in the languages distinct from Spanish must be limited to those permanent
informative elements of the web page (the names of the distinct web channels) and to
the headings on the home page.

296

♦ The General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants is currently in the process of
changing its web page. The new page is planned to be operational shortly. The
current circumstances and those of the forthcoming website are described below.

1) The Current Website

The overall translation level of the static website (excluding electronic services under
the generic name of "General Insurance Company of the State Civil Servants-Direct")
is approximately 55 to 60 percent. This means that the first and second level of
navigation are practically 100 percent translated, however after the third level the text
is in Spanish only. The institutional information has been almost completely translated
(approximately 97 percent). With respect to downloadable printed documents, the
translation level is approximately 95 percent.

The electronic services (General Insurance Company of the State Civil ServantsDirect), are not translated and are only available in Spanish.

2) New web page (this page will be in operation in 2010)
2.1)

80 percent of the static website will be translated.

2.2) Electronic services will be in Spanish alone. Coverage in the remaining coofficial languages will be completed during 2010.

With respect to the National Heritage organisation, the following contents of its web
page have been translated into the co-official languages:

•

•

Language selection menu

•

Upper menu with the main areas of the website

•

Complementary menu (website map, contacts, etc.)

Requests received and answered in co-official languages.

The National Institute of Public Administration (INAP), which although has not received
requests in the co-official languages, is willing to proceed, when relevant, to answer these
requests in the co-official language used in the requests.

297

Requests for information received in a co-official language in the central services of the
General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants are answered in Spanish. With respect to
the use of the co-official languages in the requests for benefits from insurance group
members, the following conclusions and data were taken from the survey made:

In Catalonia the proportion of requests in Catalan is approximately 58% (374 out of 650
records). The percentage is much higher in Girona (86%; 167 out of 144) and Lleida
(64.5%; 129 out of 200), than in Tarragona (50%; 60 out of 120) and Barcelona (22.4%; 41
out of 183).

In the Administrative Council of National Heritage, the number of written documents which
entered the general registry of the body in 2009 in Catalan was minimal and refer to
bilingual notifications or functions regarding the payment of taxes and fines from
administrative procedures or requests. All were answered in Spanish.

Requests received by the Conflict of Interests Office are always received and answered in
Spanish. Occasionally these requests are accompanied by copies of a document written in
a co-official language.

Sub-delegation of the Government in Girona: 80% of the requests received are in
Catalan and answers are also made in the en co-official language. The Foreign Office
is an exception, in which 90% of the requests received are in Spanish and are always
answered in the same language as the request.

Sub.delegation of the Government in Tarragona: The total number of complaints and
suggestions received in 2009 was 16 in Spanish and 1 in the co-official language.
•

Staff with knowledge of official languages and their level of knowledge

Among the activities promoted by the INAP as part of the Programme of Continual
Training for Public Employees is the teaching of co-official languages for civil servants in
the General Department of the State who are posted in the areas of the Autonomous
Communities of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, The Valencian Community, the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and the Balearic Islands.
298

In the case of Catalonia these activities are undertaken by the INAP, using its credits from
the Programme of Continual Training for Public Employees, under the Delegation of the
Government in Catalonia, which coordinates the courses and participates in the selection
of students and teachers.

The following table shows the main figures for teaching activities in the co-official
languages since 2006:

The Level of Accessibility of Web Pages in the Co-official Language.

44% of all the pages on the website of the Ministry of Culture have been translated into the
co-official languages, with half of them reaching a fourth level of browsing.
Among the services offered by the Ministry of Culture, documents for downloading are not
translated, however the program called "Ask; the Libraries Respond" is notable for its
interactivity in the co-official languages (http://www.pregunte.es/consulta/consulta.cmd),
this programme allows users to ask questions and make requests using the Internet.
Responses are provided by professional librarians via e-mail within a three-day period.
The consultations and requests for information may be made in any of the co-official
languages of the state and the responses to these requests are provided in the language
of the requests.
In addition, the websites for the digital library projects promoted and undertaken by the
Ministry of Culture are translated into all the co-official languages in the Spanish state. As
such, in the Virtual Library of Bibliographic Heritage, access is allowed to information
through the use of multilingual headings which contain both content descriptions and the
names of authors or institutions in the different languages of the state.
In the same way it is envisaged that the descriptions of the archives will be available in the
co-official languages in the future. This challenge will be taken on in a gradual manner,
starting with the descriptions of the archives which are located in Catalonia, especially in
the Archive of the Crown of Aragon. In this latter archive the initiation of the co-existence
of both languages is envisaged in the descriptions of the documentation which was
originally drafted in the Catalan language, including chancellery registries and others.

318

Among the services offered by the Ministry of Culture for public libraries is the Generator
of Websites for Libraries, a tool designed for librarians which allows them to create the
websites of their libraries without any kind of linguistic limitation. To this end the libraries of
those autonomous communities with two official languages offer their contents in both
languages.
With respect to the area of the scenic arts and music, in those sections which correspond
to the web page of the ministry and in those of artistic creation centres, access is possible
to directories in the four co-official languages. Furthermore, in the new web pages of the
numerous creation centres of the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music, information
will be presented in the co-official languages of the state.

In 2009 the web pages of those museums administered by the Ministry of Culture began to
include the co-official languages of the autonomous communities. The index and the static
content of the National Museum of Subaquatic Archaeology (ARQUA) were translated in
2009. The web pages of the National College Museum of San Gregorio of Valladolid and
the National Museum of Romanticism of Madrid will soon be adapted. The aim is to
include the above-mentioned languages as the web pages of the other museums are
updated.
With respect to the National Museum of El Prado, the visitor channel which is available on
its web page is translated into the co-official languages with the following contents:
Opening Hours and Fees, Services and Recommendations, Accesses and Maps.
Furthermore the channel 15 Masterpieces is translated into these languages, with the
contents from a selection of 15 works in the museum, with technical data and explanatory
texts.

structure of the museum's website (www.museoreinasofia.es), four (Visits, Museum,
Collection and Library) are offered to users in the co-official languages of the state.

319

The National Library of Spain undertook a project to remodel its institutional website in
May 2009. This new website has been designed as a single multi-language website where
users can select their navigation language; this means that the web page structure is
identical in every language – so as to display all the contents in the official language of
Spain (Spanish) as well as in the co-official languages.
Furthermore, at the end of 2010, the library will be implanting a platform which will facilitate
a system of integrated translation on its website and will initiate a follow-up process for all
those works pending translation. It is envisaged that the system will substantially improve
the time required for the translation of the contents of the National Library website into the
previously-mentioned languages as they will be available in one or two days.

The National Library also has a channel on Youtube in which all its videos are transcribed
into the different co-official languages of the state.

(http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html)
•

The Level of Accessibility of Web Pages in the Co-official Language.

The Ministry Web Page
The ministry web page (http://www.mpt.es) is available in the co-official languages, and a
large part of its content is available in them. Over the last few years a large effort has been
made in the revision and translation of contents.

Given the large volume of information available of the web page of the Ministry of
Territorial Policy, the decision was made to adapt the web with respect to navigation
levels, beginning with the upper levels, as these are the most visible.
The contents of the web page have now been translated, at least to the fourth level of
browsing, and even more in some of its sections. For the moment the news features are
not translated due to the urgency involved in their publication, as they would lost relevance
given the delay involved in translation. The translation of news items has not been seen as
necessary at later moments, as interest for this information decreases with time.
It has been estimated that there are now more than 300 translated pages available.
Statistics for access to http://www.mpt.es for 2009 in the distinct co-official languages are
given below:

Website Entries in Co-Official Languages

The publishers of content have an infrastructure at their disposal which allows the
introduction of translations through a user-friendly interface which provides them with
321

translations of the texts they request for inclusion on the website.

Among the improvements programmed in the publishing environment, and which are to be
approached in the near future, is the project for the introduction of a translation workflow
which facilitates the process of obtaining translations and which in turn, will lead to the
greater involvement of publishers in the inclusion of translated texts.

This media has also been used (http://www.mpt.es) to place notification signs for
construction projects in the co-official languages at the disposal of those councils which
are beneficiaries of the State Fund for Local Investment, as can be seen at
http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html. These signs have
been re-used for the State Fund, for Employment and Local Sustainability.

In the setting up of the ministry's electronic site, the need for translated contents is being
taken into consideration. As such, “Acceda” (Access), the application used as a basis for
the site, has been adapted to allow the translation of the forms used by the public in the
electronic processing of procedures, and it will also allow the inclusion of various contents
which have been translated into the co-official languages, in addition to others, such as
English and French.

The Intranet of the Ministry of Territorial Policy

In the working environment of ministry staff, the linguistic diversity of the Spanish state has
also been considered. In this manner, the Intranet of the ministry (http://intranet.mpt.es)
was designed with this criteria in mind, such that it has versions of pages in the co-official
languages and it is prepared for the inclusion of translated contents on these pages.

•

The Tax Office:

The Internet site of the Tax Office enables effective communication in the co-official
language of the user's choice. As such, the website of the Tax Office appears in Spanish,
Catalan, Galician and Valencian and provides definitive information in Basque.

Given the volume of information to be translated, the incorporation of translated
material onto these pages is gradual. As such users are provided contents in
Catalan, Galician, Valencian and those which are not yet available in the abovementioned languages are in Spanish. The Tax Office is however committed to
continue its improvements in this sense. In all events it has been guaranteed that
tax payers may use the co-official language of their autonomous community.

The translated contents cover all levels of navigation except news, due to the
immediate nature of its content and other exceptions, due to technical reasons or
due to the time needed for translation, above all in the case of PDF documents.
With respect to the translation of normative provisions, only those translated into the
corresponding co-official language are published in the official newspapers.
Two types of services are provided on the Internet website of the Tax Office: Tax
information and personalised services; services on tax information are provided in

Level of accessibility of web pages in the co-official language

The general framework of action in which the administrative activity of the department
takes place does not normally involve the use of co-official or minority languages, except
in relations of information through the web page and public information points in the central
offices of the ministry, where communication with the public does not often involve direct
contact and communication is, in the immense majority of cases, undertaken via telephone
or e-mail.

In 2008 the request for information relating to different department areas exceeded
450,000 demands and these were attended in the language chosen by the person making
the request. As there are no statistics on the distribution of the languages used by those
requesting information, it may be stated that the use of Spanish was in the majority.

The visits to the department web page; hppt://www.marm.es, which has information in all
the co-official languages of Spain, as well as in English and French, were mostly in
Spanish during 2008. 97% of web page visits were made using Spanish, some 60 million
during the year. The most used official language was Catalan, with 0.55%, followed by
Galician, with 0.36% and Basque, with 0.32%.

The ministry web page also offers information in the co-official languages in a static form;
a legislative data base exists in which the regulations of certain autonomous communities
may be consulted in a language other than Spanish.
A new web page is currently being designed which integrates the contents of the areas of
the environment and the rural and marine areas in a more harmonised manner, and which
has a new system which will improve the adaptation of the website to the use of the coofficial languages as well as of French and English.

detailed below, the parties are obliged to permit and/or foster:

Sub-paragraph a: the use of the regional or minority languages in the structure of regional
or local administration;

350

The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia de 2006 (EAC) provides legal cover with respect to
the right of linguistic option for the public. This means that in their relationships with the
institutions, organisations and public administration bodies in Catalonia, everyone has the
right to use the official language of their choice; this also implies an obligation for the
institutions, organisations and public administration bodies, including the electoral
administration in Catalonia and in general, those private bodies which depend on it in the
exercise of public functions. In its preliminary section the statute establishes that Catalan
is the official language of Catalonia, as is Spanish and Occitan. It also established the right
of all people to use the official languages and determines that the citizens of Catalonia
have the right and the duty to understand Catalan and Spanish.

The Linguistic Ability of Civil Servants of Regional and Local Public Administration
Bodies

The understanding of Catalan, like that of Spanish, is obligatory for access to public duties
in the administrative bodies of Catalonia. Taking into account that the level of Catalan
required is on the same level the basic secondary school exam, the majority of applicants
for jobs in public bodies are exempt from having to verify their understanding by means of
a specific test during the selection process. Therefore in the application to positions in the
public sector in Catalonia it is often the case that those applicants who live in Catalonia,
possess the level of linguistic competence required in the official languages as these are
subjects which form part of the school curriculum.

The following table shows the development of the total number of applicants to positions in
the public sector of the Government of Catalonia for the 2006-2008 triennium, those
exempt from undertaking the test in Catalan due to their possession of approved
certificates, those who took the Catalan exam and those who passed the exam. The
figures show that the teaching of Catalan for staff in Catalan administrative bodies is both
generalised and sufficient.

The Regulatory Framework for the Use of Catalan by Administrative Bodies and
Catalan Institutions.

In compliance with that established in the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia and the Law of
the Parliament of Catalonia 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy, the language of
public administration bodies in Catalonia is Catalan. This means that Catalan is their
habitual working language and the language of habitual relations with the public, without
adversely affecting the right of the public to request that notifications of administrative acts
be made to them in another official language.
352

The adoption of Catalan as a habitual language in the administrative bodies of Catalonia
has had a direct effect on the diffusion of its social use. The progressive assumption of
powers by the Government of Catalonia and other Catalan administrative bodies and their
growing influence in the different areas of the daily lives of the public has had a significant
impact on the standardisation of the understanding and use of Catalan. As such it is
important to note that, notwithstanding the use of Spanish when requested by interested
parties, Catalan is the habitual working language of administrative bodies in the provision
of public services, be they in education, health, culture, welfare, the environment,
transport, security or of any other type.

With respect to Article 10.2 and the Charter; Royal Decree 2586/1986, which approved the
Regulation of the Organisation of Local Organisations, makes provision for the use of
Spanish and the

language of the autonomous community in equal terms. This state

regulation respects competence in linguistic matters and the administration of the
autonomous communities at a local level.

Data on the Linguistic Uses of the Public Administration Bodies of Catalonia.

An investigation on linguistic use between 2003 and 2007 shows how those administrative
and institutional bodies which have adopted Catalan as a language of use are the
Administration of the Government of Catalonia (both the administration itself in addition to
public organisations and companies) and local administrative bodies.

In the administration of the Catalan Government, the percentage use of Catalan exceeds
90% in all areas. In the autonomous bodies and public companies linked to the
Government of Catalonia, it must be noted that the percentage for the lowest level of use
(around 85%) is found in general written communications and in oral communication.

With respect to the development of data from local administrative bodies (the survey was
not undertaken in the administrative bodies of the Catalan Government or in public
companies in 2003), it must be noted that in all the items selected, the use of Catalan has
either increased or it has stayed the same.

In the case of local administrative bodies, the percentage of use in signs remains the
353

same, as use was already at almost 100%, while increasing by more than 8 percentage
points in written communications with users.

In the case of state administrative bodies, the use of Catalan in general written
communications and in signs increases by more than 5 percentage points, while to a
lesser degree, its use in spoken communication also increases. The use of Catalan in
personalised written communications remains at around 30%.

The graph below shows the use of Catalan language in those administrative bodies
located in Catalonia. The data has not been obtained during the same year, although all

with that established in Law 2/2007 of 5 June of the Official Diary of the Government of
Catalonia in Article 4, is also to be published in Spanish and those provisions which

specifically affect the area of Aran will also be published Aranese. The chapter devoted to

Sub-paragraph e: the use by regional groups of regional or minority languages in the
debates of their assemblies, without however excluding the use of the official language(s)

With respect to the Parliament of Catalonia, Catalan, Spanish and Aranese may be used
freely. The parliamentary regulation does not expressly establish this, however in all
cases, it is must be noted that in practice its sessions are undertaken entirely in Catalan.

Sub-paragraph g: the use or the adoption and, where applicable, together with the
denomination in the official language(s), of the traditional and correct forms of place

Toponymy

The Commission on Toponomy was formally created by means of Decree 59/2001 of 23
January, as a body for assessment, consultation and proposals with respect to the official
establishment of the place names of Catalonia.

Some of the projects undertaken by the Commission on Toponymy are detailed below:

a. The finalisation of the extension of the Nomenclàtor oficial de la toponímia major de
Catalunya (The Official Nomenclature of the Main Toponyms of Catalonia)

The extension project for the Nomenclàtor oficial de la toponímia major de Catalunya
sought to continue the work, extend the number of official toponyms and incorporate the
phonetical transcription of some toponyms, fundamentally that of the most important town
in each municipality and the population centres of Catalonia (approximately four thousand
items).

The original Nomenclàtor had 39,661 entries, while the toponymical base of 1:50.000 is
55,189. The objective was therefore to cover the official registration of this entire
toponymical base. The work was initiated in February 2005 and ended in December 2007.
355

This project went beyond the simple quantitative extension of the first Nomenclàtor as the
project comprised a new Nomenclàtor which now contains additional supplementary data
with respect to the 2003 edition, such as sound archives for the digital version,
organisation by municipalities, a more complete indexing and a new format of the work,
which is divided into three volumes.

b.The publication of the Nomenclàtor toponímic de la Catalunya del Nord (The
Nomenclature of the of the French Department of the Western Pyrenees).

This publication is the result of the cooperative agreement between the Institut d’Estudis
Catalans (Institute of Catalan Studies) and the University of Perpignan. It includes the
phonetical transcription of the toponyms, in line with UN recommendations.

c. Criteria of Municipal Toponomy

In 2006 the Commission on Toponomy created several criteria for establishing municipal
toponomy to serve as guidelines, especially for local administrative bodies on the
denomination or adaptation of municipal toponomy (streets, new neighbourhoods, town
centres, industrial estates, etc.) in a linguistically correct form suited to the historical,
geographical or cultural heritage of each place. In 2006 the publication Criteris per a la
toponímia d’àmbit municipal (Criteria for Municipal Area Toponomy) was produced, 3,500
copies of which were published in Catalan and 500 in Aranese.

Dissemination tasks have been undertaken for the Criteris which were distributed to
different organisations and institutions and which were presented in several symposia and
conferences (such as the Toponímia cartogràfica. Tendències actuals i futures
[Toponomy, Cartography, Current and Future Trends], undertaken in the Cartographic
Institute of Catalonia on 18 May, 2007).

d.The “Mots amb arrels” (Words with Roots) Exhibition

The Commission on Toponymy and the Caixa Sabadell Foundation organised the
exhibition “Mots amb arrels. Els noms de lloc ens parlen" (Words with Roots, Place Names
356

which speak to Us), which was presented in the Palau Robert on 10 February of 2005.

The objective of the exhibition was to publicise and help to preserve an extensive and
varied cultural and linguistic heritage which is at times in danger of disappearing or being
distorted. This highly visual exhibition dealt with the alterations of toponyms under
dictatorial rule, of the creation of new toponyms in modern times, with many distortions in
popular tourist areas and housing estates for second homes, in addition to microtoponomy, which is formed by a series of names of local areas, such as springs, rivers,
unique landscape features, caves and houses, which perhaps remain only in the memory
of farmers and fishermen.

After its inauguration in 2005, the exhibition began a tour which placed it within the reach
of numerous towns. On 6 February 2006, as the original exhibition started its tour, the
Barcelona Provincial Government and the Commission on Toponomy signed a joint
participatory agreement which allowed the government body to undertake an adaptation of
the original format to offer to its library network.

e.The Conference of the Specialised Commission of Geographic Names of the Ministry
of Works: The Standardisation of Toponymy in Spain.

The Commission on Toponomy of Catalonia has actively participated in the conference
organised by the Specialised Commission of Geographic Names (CNG) in November
2007 which permitted the initiation of a debate forum and a meeting on this subject.

The CNG was created within the Upper Geographical Council as an investigative body for
the preparation of proposals on geographic names. Its main objective is to promote the
standardisation and coordination of geographic names throughout Spain, in cooperation
with the respective competent bodies. Within the proposals of the CNG action plan is that
of fostering the investigation, coordination and cooperation among institutions which deal
with this subject, to publicise the importance of toponmy as a heritage and to promote its
correct use in society and in other areas and disciplines, in addition to issuing reports on
geographical names as a consultational body for public and private institutions.

f.Signs on main roads

357

Catalan toponomy is the official toponomy used for main roads (highways) in accordance
with the Catalan Laws 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy and 7/1993 of 30
September, on main roads. With respect to non-Catalan toponyms (ex-toponyms),
according to Catalan Decree 78/1991 of 8 April, on the use of toponomy, Catalan must be
designated when a traditional denomination exists in this language. Catalan has therefore
an outstanding presence in informative signs although this follows international
regulations.

With respect to informative signs, it must be noted that the state still applies a regulation
which demands the use of Spanish in informative signs destined for traffic on all public
roads, both those which depend on the Spanish state and those of other administrative
bodies. This law is Legislative Royal Decree 339/1990 of the 2nd of March which approved
the text of the Law on Traffic, the Circulation of Motor Vehicles and Road Safety. Article 56
of this law states that "The written indications on signs will be expressed in the official
language of the state of Spanish at least". Although Royal Decree 1428/2003 of the 21st of
November, which develops Legislative Royal Decree 339/1990, establishes the use of
bilingual practices (the co-official area language and Spanish) in those areas with more
than one official language.

During 2004, the Department of Territorial Policy and Public Works began a plan to renew
road signs in order to improve signs for guiding traffic, in order to inform drivers in a fuller
and more comprehensible way and improve road safety and the quality of driving, which
also included an improvement of the linguistic policy on the texts of road signs. This plan
established the improvement of signs of some 2,982 junctions with the installation of some
29,000 new signs. During the first phase of the plan a total of 1,090 junctions were
improved and 8,860 signs were installed. In the second phase, which began in October
2006, a total of 1,056 junctions were improved with the installation of 13,164 signs.

PARAGRAPH 3: With respect to those public services guaranteed by the administrative
authorities or by other persons who act on their behalf, the contracting parties, in the areas
where the regional or minority languages are spoken and with respect to the situation of
each language and to the extent that this it is reasonably possible, agree:

Sub-paragraph a: to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used when a
service is provided ; or
358

As Catalan is the language of use of the Catalan administrative bodies (that of the
Government of Catalonia and of local government bodies), services are provided in
Catalan.

Sub-paragraph b: to allow the speakers of the regional or minority languages to present
requests and receive answers in the above-mentioned languages;

PARAGRAPH 4: In order to apply the provisions of Paragraphs 1,2 and 3, which they
have accepted, the parties agree to adopt one or more of the following measures:

Sub-paragraph a: Translation or interpretation as may be requested;

Sub-paragraph b: The recruitment and, where applicable, the training of civil servants and
other public employees in a sufficient number;

Sub-paragraph c: The acceptance, to the extent that this is possible, of the requests of
public employees who understand a regional or minority language so that they are posted
to the area where this language is spoken.

With respect to the understanding of the Catalan language by civil servants in Catalan
administrative bodies, the Catalan Law on Linguistic Policy 1/1998 of 7 January, establishes
in the selection process in the application for staff positions in the administration of the
Government of Catalonia, of local administration bodies and of the administration and
services of universities, including the workforce, must be accredited with an understanding of
the Catalan language, both in oral and written expression, at a level appropriate to the
functions of the positions involved, in terms established by law with respect to civil servants.

Decree 161/2002 of 11 June determines the level of understanding of Catalan and of
Aranese required for each type of job in accordance with the certification levels established in
legislation with respect to civil servants and in the applicable work regulations and
systematizes its accreditation. As such, from the enactment of this decree, the basic manner
of verifying an understanding of Catalan in order to apply for staff positions in Catalan
administrative bodies are the certificates of compulsory secondary education (ESO) or high
school courses undertaken in Catalonia, which this decree places at Level C in terms of
359

abilities in Catalan. Verification may also be provided, in all events, by means of certificates
from the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy or equivalent certificates, such as those of the School
of Public Administration of Catalonia, the Consortium for linguistic standardisation and
university linguistic services. Those applicants for public duties who do not have any of these
means of certification are allowed to take a specific exam in Catalan as part of the selection
process.

With respect to local administrative bodies, in 2003 Legislative Decree 2/2003 of 28 April
was approved. This is a consolidation of the Municipal Law and Local Government of
Catalonia, which incorporates the provisions of the above-mentioned Law 1/1998 on
Linguistic Policy. Thus, Catalan law on local government already incorporates in its
provisions, the obligations of local government to demand the verification of an
understanding of Catalan in its staff selection process, in both oral and written expression,
at a level appropriate to the functions of the positions involved (Article 287.2).

PARAGRAPH 5: The parties agree to allow, at the request of the interested parties, the
use or the adoption of patronymics in the regional or minority languages.

Previous to the ratification of the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages,
State Law 40/1999 of 5 November, on names and surnames and their order already
incorporated the regulation which Catalan legislation contained in this area. Article 19 of
the Catalan Law on Linguistic Policy 1/1998 and the development made to the latter by
Catalan Decree 208/1998 of 30 July, which regulates the verification of the linguistic
correction of surnames, establish a simple legal procedure which may be carried out by all
those who wish to register their surname in accordance with the correct spelling in the
registry.

1. The Application of Article 11. Communications Media.

Paragraph 1. For the speakers of regional or minority languages, in the territories in which
these languages are spoken, in accordance with the situation of each one of these and to
the extent that the public authorities, in a direct or indirect manner have the authority,

360

attributions or a role to play in the aforementioned area, while respecting the principles of
independence and autonomy of the communication media, the parties agree:

sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent in which the radio and the television have a public
service role, a: to guarantee the creation of at least one radio station and one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph b, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station in
the regional or minority languages;

Catalan in Audiovisual Communications Media

-

The channels of the Catalan Corporation of Radio and Television of the Government
of Catalonia and Local Television Channels

Law 10/1983 of 30 May creates the public body of the Catalan Corporation of Radio and
Television (CCRTV) and establishes that Catalan is the language normally used in the
communications media of the Government of Catalonia. Its channels broadcast all of its
programmes in Catalan. In Law 11/2007, the Catalan Corporation of Audiovisual Media is
presented as an instrument which should give a new impetus to Catalan public television
services.

For its part, the presence of Catalan on local Catalan television channels is governed by
Catalan Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy. This law determines the use of
Catalan in the programming of local municipal and private channels.

According to Article 25 of the above-mentioned law, the language normally used in the
channels administered by the Government of Catalonia or local government bodies must
be Catalan. The law continues with Article 26 which regulates the use of Catalan in
privately-run channels. These are obliged to guarantee that at least 50% of the
programmes they produce themselves must be in Catalan.

The importance of local television channels for the extension of the social use of Catalan
must be noted, given their proximity to the public.

361

-

State Television

Almost all the programmes of TVE (Spanish television) are broadcast in Catalonia.

sub-paragraph c, i) to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph d: to foster and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph e, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of, at least
one press organisation in the regional or minority languages;

The fact that there are written communications media in Catalan is a symptom of the
normality of the language, and attaining their progressive "Catalanisation" is one of the
objectives of Catalan Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy, Article 27 of which
establishes, in Points 2 and 3 that the Catalan Government must foster and may subsidise
periodical publications of general dissemination, in addition to county and local publications
which are written entirely or largely in Catalan. Given the difficulties which still exist for the
development of the press in Catalan and in Aranese in the press published and sold in
Catalonia, a policy of promotion is undertaken through the concession of subsidies which are
open to companies and press publication companies.

This subsidy from the Catalan government to the press has been promoted by the
Government of Catalonia since 1983 as a mechanism for compensating for the
disadvantageous situation which resulting from the small size of the market in Catalan for
publishing companies and organisations. It is a subsidy for the publication and sale of the
press publications in Catalan or in Aranese, of an automatic character which seeks to
strengthen the productive and territorial structure of the press in Catalan which takes the
frequency, territorial coverage and the legal nature of the publishing company as a parameter
of calculation.

The most important range of subsidies has been that of automatic subsidies for the
publication and sale of periodical publications in Catalan or in Aranese. The second line

362

seeks to provide support to consolidation companies for newspaper companies and the
extension of the press in Catalan or in Aranese.

Information is offered below on the newspapers in Catalan which are published in Catalonia,
in order of publication numbers.

sub-paragraph f, ii): to extend the existing measures of financial assistance to
audiovisual productions in regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff in those
communications media which use regional or minority languages.

PARAGRAPH 2: The parties are obliged to guarantee the freedom of direct reception of
radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language spoken in an
identical or similar manner to a regional or minority language, and not to oppose the
broadcasting of radio and television programmes from neighbouring countries in this
language. They also agree to ensure that no restriction on the freedom of expression and
the free circulation of information is placed on the published press with respect to a
language spoken in an identical or similar manner to a regional or minority language.

The above-mentioned exercise of freedoms, which involves duties and responsibilities,
may be subject to certain procedures, conditions, restrictions or sanctions established by
the law, which constitute necessary measures in a democratic society for national security,
territorial integrity or public safety, the defence of order and the prevention of crimes, the
protection of health or the publication of confidential information or to guarantee the
authority and impartiality of judicial powers.

paragraph 3: The parties are obliged to ensure that the interests of the speakers of
regional or minority languages are represented or taken into account in consideration of
the framework of the structures which are created in compliance with the law, in order to
guarantee the freedom and plurality of the communications media.

The Audiovisual Council of Catalonia

364

The Audiovisual Council of Catalonia is the independent regulatory authority in the area of
public and private audiovisual communication in Catalonia, as established by Article 82 of
the Statute of Autonomy of 2006, which established that already affirmed in Law 2/2000 of
4 May, on the Audiovisual Council of Catalonia and in Law 22/2005 of 29 December, on
audiovisual communication in Catalonia.

The Law on the Creation of the Audiovisual Council (Law 2/2000) encharges this body in
the area of its duties, with the function of ensuring linguistic and cultural plurality
throughout the audiovisual system in Catalonia and especially, with the fulfilment of
legislation which refers to the preservation and the

standardisation of Catalan and

Aranese languages and cultures.

In order to undertake its functions and in the exercise of its responsibilities, the Audiovisual
Council of Catalonia approved Agreements 118/2004 of 17 November, which contain the
general instructions on the presence of the Catalan and Aranese languages and cultures
in the audiovisual communications media (DOGC nº. 4281 of 16 December). This
instruction, which was first applied in 2005 was revised, and after talks with the sector, at
the end of 2007 a new version was approved: the general instruction of the Audiovisual
Council of Catalonia on the Presence of Catalan and Aranese Languages and Cultures in
the Audiovisual Communications Media (Agreement 295/2007 of 19 December, of the
Audiovisual Council of Catalonia, DOGC no. 5,037 of 28 December).

Normative Changes: The Ruling of 2007

On the one hand, the Ruling of 2007 adapts the norms to the legislative changes, basically
due to the application of the new Law on Audiovisual Communication. On the other hand it
seeks to provide answers to several difficulties which had been identified during the three
years when the Ruling of 2004 was applied. To this end, for example, the processing of
the declarations by organisations which provide radio and television services regarding the
fulfilment of their obligations must be mentioned – with the new ruling these declarations
have been simplified. On one hand sending these declarations by telematic means is now
possible (Article 13.3). While the declaration on language fulfilment is changed from a
trimestral to an annual procedure (Article 13.1.a); and with respect to songs, the option of
an annual declaration is provided for those bodies which provide public radio services for
municipalities with low populations (up to 10,000 inhabitants) (Article 13.1.b).
365

With respect to those bodies which provide privately-run radio services which form part of
state-area stations, the 2007 Ruling, taking into account that the legislation, with respect to
linguistic regulation, sought to ensure that broadcasts in Catalan reached the maximum
number of listeners, introduced calculation criteria which were different with respect to
audience: in the time slots with the most audience (from 10.00 to 14.00 and from 19.00 to
22.00) the broadcasts in Catalan are counted twice; in the time slot with the least audience
(from 02.00 to 06.00), only half is counted (Article 9.2.b). For these stations which form
part of Spanish stations, the ruling maintains the possibility already introduced by the
Catalan Government (Article 6.f, Decree 269/1998) of excluding the obligation to
broadcast in Catalan language for a maximum time period of six consecutive hours.

With respect to songs in Catalan, the legal obligation of guaranteeing an appropriate
presence of the language and in which at least 25% songs must be in Catalan or Aranese
(Article 3.e, Article 4.1, Article 5.e, Article 6.2) may be subject to adaptations after the
application of 2007 Ruling. Those private radio and television channels which broadcast
music in 75% of the total programming hours, i.e. thematic stations which specialise in
music, may request an adaptation of the obligation, which will have taken into account the
availability of the titles in Catalan with respect to the type of music which is mainly
broadcast by those providing the services (Article 4.4.c, Article 6.3), and provided that the
commitment and provided that it does not contradict the commitment taken on in the
certificate enabling the broadcasting. This possibility, which facilitates adaptations,
consolidates the line which recognises specific situations which the regulation had already
developed, with the exclusion of this obligation, from its application, with respect to those
public broadcasting companies which specialise in classical music.

-

Monitoring the Fulfilment of the Linguistic Regulation

In accordance with the corresponding ruling, since 2004 the Audiovisual Council has used
three procedures to analyse the fulfilment of obligations:
•

The declarations which service provision companies are obliged to send.

•

The complaints presented to the council on the presence of the Catalan language in
their programming.
366

•

The direct monitoring of some, randomly selected service provision companies.

A high level of fulfilment occurs with respect to the broadcast language by public operators
with respect to the monitoring procedures undertaken. With respect to private operators,
levels of difference have been detected in terms of the applicable general regulation or of
different commitments deriving from the concession.

Finally, from another perspective, a relevant fact from 2007 is the holding (Agreement
297/2007 of the Audiovisual Council of Catalonia) of a contest for the award of
concessions for the private use of eighty-three FM band radio frequencies. The file of
clauses for this contest includes one (18.2.3.1.2) in which the improvement of broadcasts
in Catalan is evaluated and, if applicable, in Aranese, beyond the legal provisions, with a
maximum score of up to 100 points. Another clause (18.2.3.1.7) refers to the broadcasting
of songs in Catalan and Catalan culture, with a maximum score of up to 20 points for
programming devoted to the promotion of manifestations of Catalan culture, and of up to
10 points for the improvement of the presence of songs in Catalan and, where applicable,
songs in Aranese.

Estudi d’opinió pública sobre els mitjans audiovisuals de Catalunya (Public

Opinion Research on Audiovisual Media in Catalonia )

The Estudi d’opinió pública sobre els mitjans audiovisuals de Catalunya is a report which
has been commissioned by the Audiovisual Council of Catalonia since 2003 every year,
with a sample formed by 1,600 telephone interviews to adults over 18 years of age, from
which the attitudes and consumer patterns of the Catalan public are analysed with regard
to audiovisual mass communications media. Among the aspects dealt with in the study is
an evaluation of the presence of Catalan and the consumption of radio and televised
media broadcast in Catalan.

According to data from 2007 with respect to television consumption, TV3 (a publicly owned
Catalan television channel which broadcasts in Catalan) is the channel which is most
frequently watched (55.2%), followed by Telecinco and Antena 3 TV (private Spanish
channels which broadcast in Spanish). In terms of age groups it has been noted that
Catalan language television channels are more popular among older viewers. One of the
characteristics of digital terrestrial television, (DTT) is the diversification in the offer of
367

programmes. With reference to this, in 2007 TV3 led in the rankings for the most popular
channels (17.3%), followed by La Sexta, Telecinco and Antena 3 TV (the latter all
broadcast in Spanish). With respect to television programming, it must be noted that the
five most memorable programmes are broadcast in Catalan: the Telenotícies (news) on
TV3, Ventdelplà (drama series), Polònia (comedy show), El Club and Els matins (news
and magazine programmes).

In 2007 the presence of Catalan in television was considered as adequate by 64% of
those questioned in the survey, while 30.6% believe that the amount is insufficient. The
results obtained with respect to radio consumption give an approximate idea of the
perception which the Catalan public have of Catalan radio stations and the use they make
of them. Catalunya Ràdio (a public radio station which broadcasts in Catalan) was the
station with the highest audience in 2007 (26.0%), followed by RAC1 (14.2% - in Catalan)
and La SER (13.7% - in Spanish). Musical stations were those listened to by the youngest
age range in the survey (18-24), with a clear leadership by Los 40 Principales (the Top 40
- in Spanish), while Catalunya Ràdio (in Catalan) was the first option chosen by listeners
over 35. El Matí, a programme on Catalunya Ràdio (in Catalan) was the most memorable
radio programme according to 16.8% of those interviewed, followed by the programme
Anda ya, from Los 40 Principales (7.4%), and the programme La Ventana, broadcast by
La SER (7.3%) (these three programmes are in Spanish).

With respect to the presence of Catalan on the radio, the percentages are similar to those
obtained in previous years with respect to those who believe that the level is adequate
(63.8%), while almost 20% of those interviewed believed that the level is insufficient.

The Audience of Audiovisual Media and the Presence of Catalan
−

Radio

According to audience participation results obtained by the General Media Studies (EGM),
which takes its data from surveys in a sample of 23,241 individuals of over 14 years of age
who live in a Catalan home, the cumulative audience of general interest radio programmes
either largely or entirely in Catalan (846,000 listeners), in 2008 was very close to that
which is mainly in Spanish (897,000). However, with respect to music programmes, those
which broadcast mostly in Spanish have many more listeners (1,327,000), a much higher
368

figure than those of Catalan music stations (486,000). Finally, the news and information
station which broadcasts in Catalan, Catalunya Informació, with 108,000 listeners has a
greater cumulative audience than programmes of the same type in Spanish (77,000).

However, if we take the radio audience figures from the Barometer of Communication and
Culture as a reference, using a sample of personal interviews taken from 29,985 people in
Catalonia aged over 14, the cumulative audience of the radio stations which are
exclusively or only partly in Catalan (910,000) in 2008 is higher, by 15,000 listeners when
compared to those of stations which broadcast largely in Spanish (895,000). However
there are more than one million listeners of mainly Spanish music stations (1,870,000) with
respect to Catalan stations (766,000) this is more remarkable than the data from the EGM.
The informative programmes broadcast in Catalan (109,000) have more listeners than
those which broadcast mostly in Spanish (85,000).
−

Television

In 2008 the approach to the language spoken on television, based on the audience of the
channels, with respect to their broadcasting area and on the assumption that those
channels which broadcast in Catalonia which offer programmes mainly in Catalan and
broadcast them throughout Spain, are almost all produced in Spanish - with exceptions –
is a fact which once again reveals the minority use of Catalan with respect to Spanish.

Taking as a reference the audience results from audimeters made and produced by
Spanish National Television (TNS), the figure for screen rates for channels which are
largely in Catalan is 22.4%, which is well below the 77.1% of the content which is almost
entirely in Spanish. It must be noted that in this 77.1% includes part of the contents in
Catalan which correspond to disconnections made by Televisión Española with the TVE
Catalonia production centre. Furthermore, in the thematic group which is taken as
comprising largely Spanish television channels, TNS includes 3/24 - the information
channel of the Catalan Corporation of Audiovisual Media (CCMA) which broadcasts
entirely in Catalan. The remaining 0.5% correspond to the category of "Others" which
basically covers autonomous area television channels.

However, following the same procedure, but with data offered by the Barometer of
Communication and Culture, the high figures of the screen rate for channels which
369

broadcast mostly in Spanish with respect to those which broadcast in Catalan is not as
great. As such, in 2008, the total quota of television channels which broadcast almost
entirely in Catalan is 35%, while those of channels which basically broadcast in Spanish is
65%.
The most recent data on the general media audiences at the time this report was made
are as follows:

The Application of Article 12. Activities and Cultural Services.

Paragraph 1. With respect to activities and cultural services, especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, in
addition to literary works and film production, traditional cultural expression, festivals,
cultural industries, including in particular the use of new technology, the parties, in what is
referred to as the territory in which the aforementioned languages are spoken and to the
extent in which the public authorities have authority, attributions or a role to play in the
area, agree:

Sub-paragraph a): to foster the expression and the initiatives of the regional or minority
languages and to encourage the different means of access to works produced in these
languages;

With respect to the actions of the Ministry of Culture:

373

The Promotion of Film and Audiovisual Media

Current Legislation on the Subject

Law 55/2007 of 28 December on Film, in Article 36 establishes that:
“In order to attend to the promotion and protection of the use of the co-official
languages distinct to Spanish in films and audiovisual media, promoting the cultural
plurality of Spain and equal opportunities of the languages of each territory with respect
to audiovisual expression and divulgation, a fund of subsidies or specific credits will be
established which will be transferred entirely to the competent bodies of the
autonomous communities which will administer them in accordance with their powers.
This state contribution, based on the principle of co-responsibility, will be provided each
year in the General State Budgets and will be destined to the production, distribution,
exhibition and promotion of the film and audiovisual industry in the above-mentioned
languages”.

The Additional Sixth Stipulation of the Law of Film, which relates to the agreements for the
fostering of film and audiovisual media in co-official languages distinct from Spanish,
establishes that:
“The Ministry of Culture, by agreement, will determine those creidits established in
Article 36 of the Law, in a way such that the funding received by each autonomous
community in the co-official language, is the annual equivalent to the sum of
contributions which this community has made during the previous financial year for the
support and fostering of the production, distribution and promotion of the audiovisual
industry in the co-official language distinct to Spanish. The funding received by each
autonomous community will not exceed 50 percent of the total subsidies which
audiovisual companies resident in this community have received from the ICAA during
the previous financial year”.

Royal Decree 2062/2008 of the 12th of December, which modifies the Law of Film in
Article 19.3, regulates the above-mentioned Article 36.

374

Relevant Actions Undertaken

In the general state budgets for 2008 a subsidy of 2,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) from the Ministry of Culture for this
purpose, 1,524,750 was transferred to Catalonia.

In the general state budgets for 2009 a subsidy of 10,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the ICAA from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose, the distribution of which is
being processed, once the approval of the corresponding agreements have been made
and signed by the parties.

Independently of that established in the Law of Film, Royal Decree 526/2002, of 14
December established facilities for obtaining subsidies for the amortization of films to
producers who made films whose original version was in a co-official language distinct
from Spanish. These subsidies have been made available since 2003 to the present.

The Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

The Ministry of Culture fulfils a constitutional mandate in all the activities which it carries
out, according to which, the diversity of the different linguistic forms of Spain is a cultural
heritage which will be subject to special respect and protection.

Those subsidies open to competition are listed below, the bases of the award regulations
stipulate that they are open to all the co-official languages of the state and aim to
encourage private intercommunication between the Spanish cultures. Members of
business associations or the academies of these languages form part of the evaluation
committees with respect to some of these subsidies:
Subsidies for non-profit companies and institutions, publishers of cultural
magazines written in any co-official language of Spain. The objective of these subsidies
is to attain the free distribution of cultural magazines in the distinct official languages of
Spain, in languages and cultural centres in Spain and abroad, among those subsidised
every year are magazines published in these co-official languages
Subsidies for the promotion of reading and the divulgation of Spanish literature,
through the undertaking of activities which promote common Spanish culture in Spain
and abroad, through conferences, seminars, etc., the participation and celebration of
375

commemorations and centennials – especially of writers -, the fostering of reading
habits and the promotion of the use of public libraries. Among those subsidised every
year are activities which are undertaken in the co-official languages.
Subsidies for the publication in any co-official language of Spain of literary works.
This award subsidises projects for publishing works from our culture, of national and
international projection in the co-official languages of Spain, which contribute to the
enrichment of our common bibliographic heritage, with the dual objective of extending
the funds of the public libraries of Spain and fostering and encouraging communication
and cultural cohesion between the autonomous communities, creating a common
bibliographic archive in all public libraries.

National Literature Awards

In those juries which take part in the National Literature Awards of the Ministry of Culture,
representatives of the academies of the co-official languages are included, and in the
criteria of these awards it is stated that works and authors in any of the Spanish languages
may be proposed. Many of these awards have been given to works written in the co-official
languages.

The Promotion of the Scenic Arts and Music

During the 2006-2008 period, the Directorate General of the National Institute of the
Scenic Arts and Music (INAEM) has followed a policy to promote expression in the
regional languages of Spain in its awards of subsidies for programmes of divulgation,
development and the preservation of the theatre and the circus and theatre and circusorientated communication.

To this end the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music dictated the resolutions of 26
December 2005, of 26 February 2007 and 8 February 2008, which make subsidies
available for programmes for the divulgation, development and preservation of the theatre
and the circus and theatre and circus-orientated communication for the years 2006, 2007
and 2008, respectively.

376

The requirements established for participating in the programme of theatre divulgation in
the national area are made flexible if the theatre productions are performed solely in one of
the official languages distinct from Spanish. This flexibility consists in the non-application
of two conditions which are compulsory for other requests: firstly, that touring projects are
undertaken in at least three autonomous communities, and in second place, that at least
40% of the performances take place outside the autonomous community which
corresponds to the company address of the applicant requesting the subsidy.

Sub-paragraph b): to encourage different means of access in other languages to works
produced in the regional or minority languages, aiding and developing the activities of
translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling;

Sub-paragraph c): to encourage access in the regional or minority languages to works
produced in other languages, aiding and developing the activities of translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling;

With respect to the actions undertaken by the Ministry of Culture:

1. Translation of published works

The Ministry of Culture awards the following subsidies for translation each year:
Subsidies for the translation and publication in any foreign language of literary or
scientific works by Spanish authors, which were originally written and published in any
of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture overseas. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.

Subsidies for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain
into other co-official languages of Spain, which were originally written and published in
any of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture in Spain. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.

2. The Subtitling of Theatre Plays
377

From 30 April to 4 May, the National Drama Centre in the Valle Inclán Theatre of Madrid,
showed an on-stage version in Catalan of the play “The Square of the Diamond” (La Plaça
del Diamant), by Mercè Rodoreda. This work is considered to be one of the most important
post-war Catalan narrative works. The play was performed in Catalan with Spanish
subtitles.

Sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
various forms of cultural activities suitably integrate the understanding and the practice of
the languages and of the regional or minority cultures in the activities whose initiative
depends on the latter or those who provide their support.

With respect to the actions undertaken by the Ministry of Culture:

1. The Divulgation of Information on Web Pages

The Ministry of Culture, the National Library and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina
Sofía all offer information in the co-official languages of the state on their individual web
pages, so promoting multi-lingual policies in the promotion of its cultural programme.

The National Library also has a channel on Youtube in which all the videos are transcribed
into the different co-official languages of the state.

2.The Divulgation of Information through other Informational Material

Temporary Exhibitions

In the temporary exhibitions organised by the Ministry of Culture, in state museums which
are managed solely by the ministry which are located in autonomous communities with a
co-official language, both the information in the hall (signs, informative texts, etc.) and
material publicising the exhibition (triptychs, posters, press adverts, etc.) are produced in
Spanish and in the respective co-official language.

378

As such, in other exhibitions held in autonomous communities with a co-official language
in which the ministry cooperates with other institutions of a general character, both
languages are used in the exhibition material.

The National Museum of El Prado.

The National Museum of El Prado has produced informative material in the different coofficial languages of the state. This material consisted in the translation of the map which
is provided for visitors at the information points located in the museum's access areas. The
examples and years in which these were translated into Galician are as follows: 2008 –
2,500 copies; 2007 – 8,000 copies; 2006 – 1,000 copies.

The continued translation of the map is planned for the coming years as stated in the
Action Plan of the National Museum of El Prado (2009-2012), as part of the objectives to
be developed by the Visitor Attention Area.

The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía

This museum plans to adapt its general material (which includes leaflets on the permanent
collections, maps and general information about the museum) into all the co-official
languages of the state as soon as possible.

The Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute (IPCE)

This institute now has the main contents of its web page translated into the co-official
languages and will also implement multi-linguistic divulgation through the progressive
translation of some of the publications which comprise the Publishing Programme of the
IPC over the coming years.

Support for Dubbing and Subtitling in Catalan

The Secretariat of Linguistic Policy (SPL) of the Government of Catalonia, in order to foster
dubbing and subtitles in Catalan, annually publishes a subsidy award programme, which is
aimed at increasing the number of commercial performances of films which are dubbed or
subtitled in Catalan. These subsidies cover the expenses of dubbing or subtitling and the
creation of copies and the promotional materials used for the distribution of the Catalan
copies.

In accordance with the proposals of film distributors, the SPL selects those films for which it
will provide resources, so that these films may be dubbed or subtitled in Catalan. The main
selection criteria are based on the commercial profitability envisaged and the target
audience, such that films for children and young people predominate in those films dubbed
into Catalan.

The intervention of the Government of Catalonia is directed at facilitating the viewing of films
in Catalan for those who choose this option. In most cases, the copy dubbed into Catalan is
shown alongside copies dubbed into Spanish, which are shown in other cinema theatres at
the same time. However, the effort of the Government of Catalonia in offering the public the
option of seeing films in Catalan, and so allowing a certain freedom of choice (which is
382

logically limited and not generalised in all films offered) is reduced by viewing conditions
which are comparatively much worse. As such, films which are dubbed into Catalan suffer an
inferiority - a fact shown in the number of cinemas which offer them - with respect to the
same film dubbed into Spanish; the location of these cinemas is normally less central, the
films in Catalan are shown at less popular times, they are available for a shorter period, they
are less well-promoted that the version in Spanish, and very often information for the
audience regarding the language in which the film is shown is not given. In order to redress
these problems, the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy has promoted the advertising of films by
means of spots, advertising slots, adverts in newspapers and on the Internet, posters and
trailers, although this does not mean that promotional conditions are in any way balanced by
these actions.

In all events, and as a consequence of the worst conditions in terms of the provision of films
in Catalan, the evaluation of commercial viability made by companies has been affected, and
as such clear support by the business sector for films shown in Catalan does not exist. In
2009 a new Law of Film in Catalonia was passed, it met with a negative response from the
Guild of Cinema Businesses of Catalonia.

With respect to subtitles, which are not habitually welcomed by audiences in Catalonia, the
reduced offer of cinema theatres which show films in their original language version (VO) and
the reluctance of distributors to show original language versions in Catalan has not
encouraged the tasks of the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy to promote the use of Catalan
subtitles. However some films have been shown in their original language versions with
subtitles in Catalan and original versions of documentary films and films which have been
presented at film festivals with Catalan subtitles (VOSC) have enjoyed continual support.

The graph below shows the development of the number of films which have been shown in
Catalan in dubbed or subtitled versions with subsidies from the Secretariat of Linguistic
Policy. 2004-2008

Support for the Promotion of Films in Catalan

The Secretariat of Linguistic Policy (SPL) has supported the distribution of Catalan language
versions of foreign-made films with subsidies for the creation and publication of promotional
materials for the Catalan versions (television spots, radio advertising slots, trailers and
posters), in order to carry out publicity campaigns for each one of these films on the
television, radio and Internet and in the press.

With respect to television and radio advertising, an advertising campaign has been
undertaken for each new film through the media channels of the Catalan Corporation of
Radio and Television (CCRTV): TV3, C33 and Catalunya Ràdio.

The CCRTV has continued to broadcast a small daily space of 30 seconds entitled "The Film
Diary in Catalan", which is broadcast before the "Telenotícies vespre" (the evening news
bulletin) and which details one of the films in Catalan currently being shown.

The SPL has sent weekly reports to the La Vanguardia, Avui, El Periódico and El Punt
newspapers (which are in Catalan and Spanish) with respect to the daily selection of films in
Catalan. The Avui (in Catalan) and La Vanguardia (in Spanish) newspapers have retained a
section solely for announcing films in Catalan in its "billboard" section.

386

A list of films in Catalan has also been published (as occurred in the previous triennium) on
the Catalan language web page of the Government of Catalonia and in the Teletext service
of Catalonia Television.

Support for Showing Films in Catalan

Copies of new films in Catalan have been distributed throughout the usual cinema circuits of
Catalonia. Normally two copies of new films are shown in Barcelona, although never in the
same conditions as Spanish versions, where a number of between ten and fifteen copies are
usually shown. Other towns where Catalan versions of films have been distributed are
Girona, Granollers, Lleida, Manresa, Olot, Sabadell, Tarragona, Terrassa and Vic.

Other initiatives in the area of films shown in Catalan are the cycles of children's films in local
and county areas. The Children's Cinema Cycle in Catalan (CINC) has been organised since
2004. This project is the result of the initiative of several cinemas in numerous towns and the
cooperation of the SPL. This cycles seeks to compensate for the deficit of films in Catalan on
the market, to form an new audience for films in Catalan and to promote consumption habits
with respect to cinematographic products in Catalan by means of attractive programming and
a policy of low prices. Most of the films selected are those which have been shown
commercially in cinemas and which are yet to be sold in a DVD format.

The Catalan Dubbing Service

In July 2005, the Catalan Corporation of Radio and Television (CCRTV) initiated the Catalan
Dubbing Service (SCD) in order to provide a definitive impulse to the presence of Catalan in
the broadcasting of film on television. The objective of the SCD is to dub films into Catalan
and to provide a televised format in order to incorporate dubbing into DVDs and other formats
of domestic consumption. TV3 is responsible for the television dubbing of foreign films which
are shown in commercial cinemas, and it provides this service free to distributors, so that
they can include dubbed versions in their DVD /video productions; the service is also made
available to those television channels which purchase broadcasting rights. In the same
manner, the SCD administers the TV3 historical dubbing archives.

The list of films currently offered free to distribution companies for their inclusion in DVD
format and which are also offered free to television channels which purchase the
387

broadcasting rights for a particular film now totals more than 8,300 films, to which 600
television series must be added.

Furthermore, during this triennium, the Catalan Dubbing Service has published a total of 168
films which it offers free, for use in DVD format.

Its web page offers information on all the films which have been dubbed into Catalan at:
www.tv3.cat/doblatge

The Catalan Institute of Cultural Industries

The audiovisual promotional policy and in a special manner, film promotion policies, of the
Catalan Institute of Cultural Industries (ICIC) have as their main objective, the total
development of companies which produce contents.

This involves the development of lines of support in the following areas:
• Project development.
• Specific support for the production of contents.
• Support for exhibition and distribution.
• Support for internationalisation.
• Support for public creation projects: festivals.

Obviously these objectives must be fulfilled within the regulatory framework of European
policies, attending to the general dynamics of co-production which govern the sector and with
the maximum relations possible with other agents, such as Television of Catalonia (TVC) or
the Institute of the Film Industry and the Audiovisual Arts (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture.

One of the objectives of the ICIC is also the empowerment and promotion of cinematographic
production in its original Catalan language version. With respect to the ICIC area of action,
which is limited to the cinematographic production of Catalan companies, an overall increase
of Catalan productions and productions in Catalan has been registered.

One must highlight the difficulties inherent in this objective, given the inevitable tendency of
national and international co-production of Catalan films; inevitable due to the growing

388

overheads in film production costs and due to the need, as a consequence of European
regulations, to consider artistic talent from any place in the European Union in equal terms.

Feature film productions in the original Catalan language version, in addition to those dubbed
into Catalan may apply, in a generic manner, to a subsidy which will contribute up to 17% of
production costs, with a maximum of 140,000 euros, and a subsidy of up to 25% of the
investment made for the promotion and advertising of the first showing of the film in cinemas,
to a maximum of 60,000 euros, which may be extended to 40,000 euros more if this
investment is over 30% of the feature film production cost, i.e. a maximum overall subsidy of
240,000 euros.

This policy has permitted a significant increase of films made in Catalan during the 20062008 three-year period, together with a parallel increase of its market quota, as shown in the
graphs below:

Support for DVDs
The majority of films dubbed into Catalan for the cinema, have a Catalan version available on
DVD. Some of the most notable films which appeared in this market sector during 2007
included; Casino Royale, Perfume, Happy Feet, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,
Ratatouille and Scoop.

The Secretariat of Linguistic Policy (SPL) has continued its policy of subsidies in order to
guarantee the inclusion of Catalan versions in DVDs and their distribution in sales points. The
total provision to these companies for this item was 150,000 euros. Thirteen companies
benefited from these subsidies for a total of 94 DVDs. The majority have obtained subsidies
for subtitles, the creation of authoring, and publishing expenses. Products aimed at children
have been given priority. The large companies in the sector, which are responsible for
producing more commercial films, have not applied for subsidies although they have included
dubbing into Catalan in their DVDs.

● The Google Books Project
The Library of Catalonia and four other Catalan libraries have joined the Google Libraries
Project in order to digitally process hundreds of thousands of books available on the public
domain (i.e. which are not subject to copyright laws) and make them available to everyone
via Internet.

The Library of Catalonia, the largest library in Catalonia, will act as a coordinator and
interlocutor of the other four Catalan libraries which participate in the project: the Library of
the Monastery of Montserrat, the Episcopal Public Library of the Seminar of Barcelona, the
Library of the Trekking Centre of Catalonia and the Library of the Barcelona Athaeneum.
393

Its archives include special collections of high patrimonial value in Catalan, Spanish, French,
German, Latin and English. Noteworthy works are those by Ramon Llull, Jacint Verdaguer
and Cervantes.

● Promotion Measures for Literary Production in Catalan undertaken by the
Government of Catalonia

Law 20/1987 of the 12th of November created the Institution of Catalan Literature as an
independent entity of the Department of Culture, in which representatives of the publishing
sector participate, in addition to writers (the Association of Writers in Catalan is represented
with respect to its section in Catalonia and writers from the Valencian Community and the
Balearic Islands, in addition to its translation section), the Ramon Llull Institute - as a social
organisation for the overseas promotion of Catalan culture and language - and the
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy. The College of Journalists of Catalonia and important
personalities in Catalan literature also form part of its advisory board.

The objective of this institution is to ensure the promotion of works by those authors who
write in Catalan both inside and outside the areas where this language is spoken. To this end
it awards subsidies to literary artists, translators, screenwriters, students, etc. It also
organises promotional campaigns for writers in schools and cultural centres, while
administering the overseas promotion of Catalan literature through exhibitions on literary
themes, participation in book fairs and contacts abroad with publishers, literary agents and
centres of writers and translators. Furthermore, the institution has created and maintains a
"Who's Who" database of current Catalan writers which was presented in book format in
1991 and which, since the year 2000, can be consulted on the Internet. It currently contains
more than 1,500 accessible files on literary authors in Catalan with two or more published
works, whose bibliographic record is available. Its territorial distribution covers the entire
linguistic domain of the Catalan language in addition to the rest of Spain and abroad.

The Institution of Catalan Literature also organises literary festivals and awards direct grants
for literary creations and activities. During the triennium covered in this report it awarded
economic subsidies to the value of:

Sub-paragraph h): where appropriate, to create and/or promote and finance translation
and terminological investigation services with a view, specifically, to maintain and develop
in each regional or minority language, the administrative, commercial, economic, social,
technological or legal terminology appropriate.

In 1985 the Department of Culture, a body with authority in the area of Linguistic Policy
and the Institute of Catalan Studies, an institution responsible for regulations pertaining to
Catalan, established the Terminology Centre TERMCAT (www.termcat.cat). Since 1994
TERMCAT has been a consortium formed by the Government of Catalonia, the Institute of
Catalan Studies and the Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation. It is currently governed
by those statutes approved by Decree 108/2006 of 25 April, which stipulate that the
objective of the centre is the general coordination of the terminological activities with
respect to Catalan, the promotion and the creation of terminological resources,
guaranteeing social availability and cooperation in the promotion and development of
products of linguistic engineering which have a special involvement in terminology. It also
undertakes the establishment and standardisation of Catalan terminological neologisms
and the provision of the support required for administrative bodies with respect to
terminology.

The Government of Catalonia, through the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy, guarantees the
financing of the TERMCAT consortium.

TERMCAT therefore standardises terminological neologisms in Catalan language, i.e. the
establishment of the most suitable Catalan forms for referring to new concepts which arise
in scientific, technical, social and humanistic areas.

There is a supervisory board which carried out a total of twenty sessions once every
fortnight in which 353 concepts were studied. Among those terms which were
standardised during 2008 - the final year analysed- the subject areas in which Termcat is
creating or created determined material are of importance, especially in the area of sports,
395

with terms from the General Sporting Dictionary, the area of the financial market, with
terms linked to the Dictionary of the Financial Markets and the area of video games with
terms from the Terminology of Video games. Priority has also been given to terminological
cases from external requests or those with significant social impact, and care has been
taken to ensure that each term subject to the consideration of the Supervisory Board has
been subject to consultation by specialists who are representatives in the specialised area
of the term.

In accordance with the participatory agreement signed in 2005 with Aenor, the Spanish
Association for Standardisation and Certification, for the drafting and publication of the
Catalan version of UNE norms at the end of this triennium, the official version has been
completed and ratified by the Supervisory Board, with eleven new norms.

● The Publication of Standardised Terminology and of the Criteria Applied
During the triennium analysed, the standardised forms have been distributed through the
Neoloteca, the online dictionary of standardised terms which is periodically updated,
distribution was also undertaken at the same time through Cercaterm. Comments have
bee made on standardised forms of general interest which have made available on a
specific area of the Termcat web page - the Neological Window -, and complete
information has been sent to those specialists consulted.

In order to ensure proper coordination between the standardised activity and the
regulatory activity, the Philological Section of the Institute of Catalan Studies and its
Lexicographic Offices receive specific information on all the terms studied, with all their
related documents. Furthermore, periodical resolutions have been prepared which have
resulted in the publication of the new approved terms in the Official Gazette of the
Government of Catalonia.

● The Monitoring of the Implantation of the New Terms
During 2008 Termcat has kept two lines of action open with two bodies which, from
different perspectives, undertake complementary approaches with respect to this
evaluation task. On one hand cooperation has continued with the University Centre of
396

Sociolinguistics and Communication which is linked to the Scientific Park of the University
of Barcelona, with the preparation of three studies linked to the area of sports. On the
other hand it has participated with the IULATerm group of the University Institute of
Applied Linguistics of the Pompeu Fabra University in the development of the ESTEN tool;
a resource which seeks to facilitate the quantitative analysis of the presence or absence of
determined terms in a specific corpus, establishing parameters of contrast according to the
date of the texts, the type of form, the type of document, etc.

● Terminological Neologisms and Cooperative Networks
Investigations and Termcat have revealed the growing importance which must be given to
the immediate detection of the needs and the maximum divulgation possible of the
proposals. To this end, the Antenna of Terminology, the network created by Termcat in
2001, with communication media which use Catalan, has become a tool for the detection
of real needs which has been created by the desire to publicise terminology in nonspecialised areas and which has also provided specific divulgation to determined initiatives
which are specifically aimed at the communications media.

During 2008, work has also been undertaken with another web-based cooperation
initiative, which was carried out with the Open University of Catalonia (UAC) and which is
determined in the Atalaya Project, an identification instrument for the terminological
neologisms used in specialised texts which are divulged through the electronic
publications of the UAC.

● The Creation of Terminology and its Divulgation
One of the priorities of Termcat is to create and facilitate terminological resources for
Catalan society which respond to the needs of specialised areas. In order to achieve this
objective, work has been undertaken in more then 50 terminological projects.

The main projects which were completed this year are: the Dictionary of Financial Markets,
the Dictionary of Nursing, the International Classification of Illnesses (CIM-9-MC), the
General Dictionary of Sport, the Multilingual Lexicon of the Industry and Terminology of
397

Video games. It must be noted that, associated with this final product, video games have
been created where users play with terminology.

This year the extension of the collections divulged through the Termcat website continued.
Six new titles have been published in the Open Terminology collection, which brings
together terminological resources which may be downloaded free of charge from the
website of the centre and 10 titles from the Online Dictionaries collection, the majority were
produced at the request of external specialised groups.

● Terminological Assessment
During 2008 the Termcat assessment services continued working in response to all the
demands for assessment requested by linguistic professionals and specialists from various
social sectors.

The Consultation Service attended 3,681 doubts regarding scientific, technical or
humanistic technology which have been made, using Cercaterm, Optimot, via e-mail or
telephone, by language professionals from the linguistic services of administrative bodies,
universities and the communications media, by companies, by self-employed professionals
in the translation and correction sector and or by specialists in diverse organisations. The
most consulted terminology corresponds to the areas of life sciences, human and social
science, industry, information technology and new technology.

Cercaterm, the online terminological consultation service has counted 1,070,784 entries, a
figure which represents an increase of 3% with respect to 2007. During 2008 2,617 new
users of Cercaterm were registered, mainly from businesses, universities and other
teaching centres, language professionals and diverse institutions in Catalonia, the
Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands and other Spanish and international areas.
Cercaterm currently has 24,534 registered users.

Termcat continued to cooperate in a noteworthy manner with institutions and organisations
linked to fostering the use of Catalan. To this end, during the triennium referred to in this
report, Termcat has participated with the project of the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy,
Plats a la Carta (A la Carte Dishes), an I.T. application which is available free of charge to

398

the entire restaurant sector for the translation of menus into Catalan and into foreign
languages.

● Data for Public Consultation
During 2008, Termcat continued to update the offer of terminological data for public
consultation from Cercaterm once every two weeks. The incorporation of all the
standardised terminology by the Supervisory Board during the year must be noted, as well
as all the files from the specific investigations undertaken by the centre consultation
service and of all the dictionaries published by Termcat in paper format or online.
Furthermore, the number of files for consultation via Cercaterm, increased significantly in
2008, these files are duly labelled with respect to their source, so that users can work with
these documentary references when considering or comparing the quality of the results
obtained through consultation.

With respect to the website, Termcat continued to maintain its web page, in which
terminological contents are offered which are related to current society. During 2008 the
total number of visits to the web page was 813,376 (almost 2,230 daily visits), with
1,850,295 pages viewed. Of these visits 24.94% were new visits, 16.91% more than the
previous year. Also noteworthy is the increase in the number of one-time users, at 14.54%.
At the same time, entries to Cercaterm slightly increased by 2.81%, with respect to data
from 2007.

● The Development of Tools for Terminological Work
During this triennium and especially during 2008, Termcat provided a significant impulse to
the development of technological tools which facilitate terminological work. On one hand it
provided GesTerm, a terminological administrator created with free software which is
downloadable from the Termcat website. It has also finalised the development of the
GdTweb, a cooperative terminology administrator which will allow those who cooperate
externally with with Termcat to work using the Internet with a terminological administration
programme connected to the centre databases. These two tools, together with the alreadyexisting GdT, complete the family of Termcat resources which facilitate terminological work
with diverse aims from more than one location.

399

Paragraph 2: With respect to those territories distinct from those in which the regional or
minority languages are used traditionally, the parties agree to authorise, foster and/or
provide, appropriate activities or cultural services, in compliance with the above paragraph,
if the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

Paragraph 3: The parties agree, in their cultural policy abroad, to provide an appropriate
place for the regional or minority languages and to the culture which these languages
express.

The Ramon Llull Institute is a consortium formed by the Autonomous Government of
Catalonia (Generalitat de Catalunya) and the Institute of Catalan Studies which aims to
promote Catalan language and Culture abroad.

● Associations, Organisations and Institutions of Catalan Studies
The Ramon Llull Institute fulfils the task of supporting existing organisations for Catalan
studies, bringing together students and experts in Catalan language and literature who
have been educated or who are resident outside the linguistic domain.

The Ramon Llull Institute signed annual statements for 2008 regarding cooperative
agreements established with the main international Catalan study organisations; the
Anglo-Catalan Society, the Association Française des Catalanistes, the Deutschen
Katalanistenverbands e.V., the Associazione Italiana di Studi Catalani, the North-American
Catalan Society and the Associació Internacional de Llanguage i Literatura Catalanes, in
addition to the Federació Internacional d’Associacions de Catalanística (FIAC).

A subsidy has been awarded to each association for activities related to Catalan studies
by means of these agreements.

● The Divulgation of Catalan
Throughout the triennium concerned in this report, the Ramon Llull Institute participated in
the main fairs and exhibitions of a state-wide and international character related to the
Catalan language and the learning of Catalan. The institute has also added the

400

organisation of acts in this area, such as conferences or round tables, to its participation in
trade fairs and exhibitions.

● The University Campus of the Catalan language
The Ramon Llull Institute organises, together with the Government of Andorra, the
University Campus of the Catalan language, which is aimed at non-Catalan speaking
students so that they may extend their understanding of Catalan and integrate into the
social fabric and natural context of Mallorca, Barcelona and Andorra after three weeks of
linguistic immersion.

This initiative, which has now been held for seven years, has taken place in Mallorca,
Andorra and Barcelona. Each course receives between 25 and 30 students of different
nationalities. During the last event, in 2008 27 people participated from 15 different
countries: Germany, Slovakia, Spain, Estonia, France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Poland,
Portugal, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Romania, Russia and Serbia. All have
taken part in courses of 30 language hours of basic (entry) or intermediate levels and
courses of 15 hours on diverse aspects of Catalan culture.
● Participation in Fairs and Exhibitions
Expolangues Paris 2006-2008

The Ramon Llull Institute has participated in the 24th 25th and 26th Expolangues Fairs
which have taken place in Paris in order to present visitors with educational and
divulgative material on Catalan language and culture. This year the fair was held under the
slogan “Discover and Learn Foreign Languages” and included the participation of
institutions and companies which represented 60 languages, corresponding to 20
countries, with German as the guest language of honour.

Expolingua Berlin 2006-2008

The Ramon Llull Institute has participated in the 19th, 20th and 21st Expolingua Fairs in
Berlin. This is an international fair for languages and cultures which seeks to present the
401

different possibilities of learning a language and informing about cultures, languages and
education programmes in different countries for visitors interested in learning languages
and for professionals in the sector.

The Frankfurt Fair 2007

Catalan culture was the guest of honour at the 58th Frankfurt Book Fair, which was held in
2007. In this framework, the Language Area of the IRL organised different promotional
activities for the understanding of Catalan in Germany:

• Catalan classes at an initial level in German secondary school institutes

An introduction to Catalan authors translated into German in secondary schools

The singular and universal Catalan culture award, also for secondary school students in
German schools

The International Catalan Symposium

The act “El català, llengua global” (Catalan, a global language)

The Language Show 2007- 2008

In the last two international Language Show language fairs of 2007 and 2008, which took
place in London, Catalan language and culture have been represented. The Language
Show is a meeting point of language teachers, students, publishers, creators of innovative
methods, language schools, organisers of language-based visits, representative
institutions and more than 150 stands.

With respect to the Ministry of Culture:

1.Book Fairs and the Delivery of Bibliographic Packs to Cultural Centres

In international book fairs which Spain attends with its own pavilion, or through the
administration of embassies, new publications which are displayed will include books and
402

magazines in all the languages of Spain, partly from the subsidies provided to editors of
magazines and the publication of books. The same applies to those packs of books sent to
libraries and cultural centres.

Furthermore, with respect to the mobility of authors overseas in fairs, conferences, etc.,
Spanish authors will participate in these, regardless of the co-official language in which
they write.

With respect to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation:

The Cervantes Institute has signed various participatory agreements with several cultural
institutions for the divulgation of the co-official languages as part of overseas cultural
policy: the Ramón Llull Institute, the Royal Academy of the Vasca-Euskaltzaindia
Language, the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language, the Galician Royal Academy of
Language and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Galician Government.

The Cervantes Institute has been offering courses for learning the co-official languages
since the academic year of 1994-1995. Several graphs are shown, detailing the
development of the courses held over the last few years.

The Application of Article 13. Economic and Social Life
An Investigation into Linguistic Use in Service Companies in Catalonia 2004-2007

The Government of Catalonia seeks an instrument with which to measure the
development of the real use of Catalan in the business environment using the application
of the Decree of 28 December, through which the 2005 Annual Programme of Statistical
Action was Approved. This decree includes, among its projects, the statistics for linguistic
use in medium-sized institutions and companies, the statistics for the use of Catalan on
the Internet and a system of linguistic indicators.

1. Objectives and methodology.

The survey on linguistic use in small and medium-sized service companies was
undertaken in three phases between 2004 and 2007.

It involved a quantitative investigation by means of on-site interviews to management staff
of 1,804 companies in the service sector (company services and financial mediation,
commerce, repairs, the hotel and catering industry, transport and other services).

2. The Main Results.

With respect to oral service criteria on first contact with clients, it must first be noted that a
large number of service companies adopt a linguistic criteria: specifically three out of every
four companies (74.5%). Of these, the majority attend their clients in Catalan (56.2%),
while those which do so in Spanish (17.3%) or in another language (1%) are in a minority.
404

Furthermore, if the interlocutor uses a language different from that used initially, almost all
service companies change to the language of the interlocutor (90.8%).

In the area of signs (main and indoor), it has been noted that Catalan is the language
which is used the most in the service sectors. 56.8% of all companies use signs which are
mainly in Catalan, although 17.8% of companies mostly use signs in Spanish. The option
of using signs in English or in other languages is almost non-existent. It must be noted that
17.8% of all companies use bilingual or multi-lingual signs which include Catalan.

The majority of companies use external documents (letter paper, stamps, publicity, bills or
receipts and e-mails) in a single language: 48.5% of all companies either solely or largely
in Catalan and 42.3% solely or largely in Spanish. It must be noted that Catalan is the
most-used language in all the entries studied with the exception of two, that of bills and
receipts and that of digital forms.

With respect to the development of the use of Catalan in companies over the last 3 or 4
years, the majority of directors and businessmen interviewed (52.7%) believe that the use
of Catalan has continued during the above-mentioned period. It has also been seen that
the number of people who believe that the use of Catalan has increased is relatively high.
Approximately one out of every three companies consider that its use has increased either
slightly or a great deal. However, the number of companies which consider that the use of
Catalan has decreased, either slightly or a great deal is approximately 10.6%.

Finally, it must be noted that territorial factors also have an important influence in linguistic
uses. In the areas of Girona and Lleida, the use of Catalan is higher than in the areas of
Tarragona and especially Barcelona.

In terms of the subsectors studied in the three phases of the investigation, difference in
linguistic uses have also been verified: the hotel and catering industry, repairs, transports
and other services reveal a greater use of Catalan than in the business, financial and
commercial service subsectors.

Paragraph 1. With respect to economic and social activities, and for the entire country, the
parties agree to:
405

Sub-paragraph a) exclude from their legislation all provisions which prohibit or limit,
without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority languages in those documents
which relate to economic or social life and especially in work contracts and technical
documents, such as instructions for the use of products or services;

The Regulation on Catalan

Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy (LPL), established several general norms on
the use of Catalan for the economic sector. In this way the work and business sector have
become one of the main figures in the process of recovering the Catalan language.

The norms on the use of Catalan in the socio-economic sector are regulated in the
following precepts of the regulations of Catalonia itself:

Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy:

Article 15. Civil and Commercial Documents.
1. Language is not a formal requirement for private documents. Therefore those written in
any language are valid, without prejudice to the translations which civil, commercial or
litigation laws demand for their undertaking if the language is not official in Catalonia.
2. Private documents, whether these are private or not, whatever their nature, written in
any of the two official languages in Catalonia are valid and do not require any
translation in order to demand their fulfilment judicially or extra-judicially in the territorial
area of Catalonia.
3. The documents which are referred to in Section 2 must be drafted in the official
language which the parties agree to. However, if this involves adhesion contracts,
regulations, contracts with standard terms or general conditions, the must be drafted in
the language chosen by the consumers and they must be made immediately available
to the clients in separate documents in Catalan and in Spanish.
4. Securities of all types are valid, including those which represent shares in commercial

services which they produce or offer.
2. The companies referred to in Section 1 must use Catalan in a habitual manner in their

Law 3/1993 of 5 March of the Statute of the Consumer

Chapter IV: Linguistic Rights of Consumers

Article 26. The Use of Catalan in Information and Contracting

In accordance with that established in Article 3.3 of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia:

409

7. Consumers have the right to receive information pertinent to consumption and the use
of goods, products and services, and especially obligatory data relating directly to the
safeguarding of their health and safety in Catalan.
8. Any party interested has the right to receive in Catalan; adhesion contracts, contracts
with standard clauses, regulated contracts, general conditions and documents which
refer to them or which emanate from the undertaking of any of the aforementioned
contracts.

Article 27. The right to be attended by persons expressing themselves in any of the official
lannguages.

Companies and establishments dedicated to the sale of products or the provision of
services which undertake their activity in Catalonia must be in conditions to attend
consumers when they express themselves in any of the official languages of Catalonia.

The following emanates from the regulation detailed above:
• The public companies of the Catalan Government and of local corporations, in addition
to their concessionary companies, when they administer or make use of the service
granted, must use Catalan in their actions and in internal documents, in signs and also
in communications and notifications, in addition to bills addressed to people who are
resident in the Catalan linguistic area.
• The institutional advertising of the Government of Catalonia, local bodies and public
companies, must normally be in Catalan.
• Public service companies must use Catalan at least in signs and public-address systems
in addition to written communications and notifications addressed to persons resident
in Catalonia, without adversely affecting the right of these people to receive them in
Spanish if they request this.
• Companies which undertake the provision of services in the territorial area of Catalonia
must be in conditions to be able to attend consumers when they express themselves in
any of the official languages in Catalonia and they must possess signs and general
information in Catalan at least.
• Standard contract documentation, such as contracts of adhesion for the services of
financial companies, insurance, supplies of water, gas, electricity or telephone and
other similar services, must be immediately available to clients in Catalan and in
410

Spanish in separate documents. The right of the consumer or client of the service to
receive documentation relating to any of the aforementioned contracts in Catalan, such
as receipts and other communicative which derives from them is recognised in the
same way.
• Indoor signs in work centres must be written in Catalan at least.
• After February 2003, obligatory data and additional voluntary information detailed on
Catalan products with denomination of origin and of traditionally-made products which
are distributed in the territorial area of Catalonia must be in Catalan at least. Among
mass produced products, this measure affects wines, cavas and oils.
• The law also establishes the fostering by the Government of Catalonia of the use of
Catalan in public services, in professional activities, in work centres, in work relations
and collective bargaining agreements and work contracts and in general in work
activities, professional, commercial, advertising, cultural, associative, sporting, leisure
and of any other type of activities.

The Fostering by the Government of Catalonia of Catalan in Socio-economic
Activities.
Since the application of Law 1/1998 of 7 January, the Government of Catalonia has
demonstrated its willingness to implement an application which has been agreed upon with
economic and social agents and begin applying it in sectors which most affect the public
and emblematic products. Those agreements signed in some cases and the monitoring of
the situation of Catalan in large commercial centres, department stores, retail and catering
franchises, with special attention to large-scale companies are the paradigm.

The Government of Catalonia reports that this policy of agreement does not stop it from
demanding the fulfilment of the Law on Linguistic Policy in that which affects the rights of
consumers and users. It considers, as such, that the implication of civil society, through
non-profit making associations and bodies has a marked influence on the application of
linguistic legislation in the advance of the use of Catalan.

The Consortium for Linguistic Standardisation offers its assessment and training services
to local area companies and business organisations and to organisations in Catalonia and
also established specific cooperative practices with local bodies, both in that which
411

concerns the establishment of determined plans for the introducing Catalan into the
workplace and the resolution of specific linguistic doubts or the revision of texts and for the
cooperation of actions which promote the use of Catalan.

The Promotion of Catalan in Cell Phone Terminals. The Elteumobil.cat Campaign

Elteumobil.cat is the name of the campaign promoted by the Secretariat of
Telecommunications and the Information Society (STSI) of the Department of Government
and Public Administration Bodies and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy, both of which
form part of the Government of Catalonia. The campaign seeks to promote the use of
Catalan in cell phones. Elteumobil.cat provides information on those cell phones which are
available on the market in Catalan and which operators they may be purchased from. It
also provides information on which services and applications of the Government of
Catalonia and of the Catalan Corporation of Interactive Radio and Television may be used
with cell phones.

The Elteumobil.cat campaign arises from the agreement signed in 2007 between the
Department of Government and Public Administration Bodies, the manufacturing
companies Nokia, Motorola, Alcatel and Sony Ericsson and the operating companies of
Movistar, Vodafone, Orange and Yoigo. With this agreement these manufacturers agreed
to progressively incorporate Catalan into cell phones before the 31st of December 2008
while the operators agreed to request the inclusion of Catalan as a requirement for
approval in the sale of cell phones.

The campaign website (www.elteumobil.cat) has been active since September 2007, a fact
which was reported to the organisations involved in the agreement. Letters were sent by
the STSI and the SPL to the main operating companies and cell phone distributor
companies requesting that they inform their sales points about the existence of the
campaign (Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, Media Markt, El Corte Inglés, FNAC, Miró, Milar
and Calbet among others).

In total, 270,000 euros have been allocated between the

STSI and the SPL for the

advertising campaign, the production of the website, games for cell phones, the
advertising spot and posters.

412

With these initiatives, the STSI has responded to the demand for cell phones in Catalan.
According to data from the Observatory for the Information Society of Catalonia
Foundation, 11% of the population aged 15 or over have a cell phone in Catalan, however
the figures increase to 30% for those who would like wish to have a cell phone in Catalan.
It has been calculated that between direct and indirect demand, i.e. those who state that
they definitely want a cell phone in Catalan or that between a cell phone in Catalan and
one without it, who would prefer to have a cell phone in Catalan, there is a potential
demand of one and a half million users.

Sub-paragraph b) To prohibit the insertion, in the internal regulations of companies and in
private documents, of clauses which exclude or limit the use of regional or minority
languages, at least among the speakers of the same language;

Sub-paragraph c) To oppose the practices which lead to the discouragement of the use
of regional or minority languages in social or economic activities;

Sub-paragraph d) To facilitate and/or foster, through other means, distinct from those
considered in the sections above, the use of regional or minority languages

Catalan in Work-related Documents and inside Work Centres

In compliance with that established in Article 36.4 of the Law on Linguistic Policy, which is
transcribed in the first section of this article, indoor signs must be written in at least
Catalan. Therefore, without prejudice nor hindrance to that which is in other languages,
Catalan cannot be excluded from indoor signs.

With respect to the presence of Catalan language in labour agreements or collective
bargaining agreements an upward trend has been maintained over the first two years of
the triennium which concerns this report, although in the last of these years – 2008 – the
presence of Catalan in favour of Spanish has dropped. The table and graph below show
development over the 2005-2008 period.

However, although the total figure and the percentage of labour agreements registered in
Catalan (solely or together with Spanish) has descended in 2008, it must be noted that the
number of workers affected by labour agreements registered in Catalonia in Catalan has
increased considerably; as such, those workers affected by agreements registered solely
in Spanish in 2008 were only 10.7 of the total. The following table illustrates this
development.

● Linguistic Use in Companies
The graph below shows linguistic use registered by official surveys in distinct areas (signs,
oral communication, generalised written communication and personalised written
communication). The data is taken from 3 surveys undertaken at distinct times (Linguistic
use in Large Companies with International Scope, present in Catalonia, 2002; the Survey
of Linguistic Use in Public Institutions (EULIP) 2004; and the Survey on Linguistic Use in

415

Paragraph 2. With respect to economic and social activities and to the extent that public
authorities have jurisdiction, the parties, in the area in which the regional or minority
languages are spoken and as far as is reasonably possible, agree to:

Sub-paragraph a) define, through financial and banking regulations, provisions which
allow, in conditions consistent with commercial practice, the use of regional or minority
languages in the drafting of payment orders (cheques, letters of exchange,etc.), or other
financial documents or, where applicable to seek to apply this process;

In conformity with Article 26.b) of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of 2006 and Article
15.3 of Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Linguistic Policy, those contracts of adhesion, with
standard clauses or general conditions, such as those of financial companies, insurance
companies, water, gas, electricity or telephone supplies and other similar services, must
be immediately available to clients in Catalan and in Spanish in separate documents. Any
party interested has the right to receive documentation related to any of the contracts
mentioned in Catalan in addition to receipts (for example) and other communications
which emanate from these contracts (Articles 15.3 LPL and 26.b EC).
416

Sub-paragraph b) In those economic and social sectors which depend directly on their
control (the public sector) to undertake actions which foster the use of the regional or
minority languages;

The public companies of the Government of Catalonia and local corporations (e.g.
Transportes de Barcelona, Ferrocarriles de la

Generalidad or ADIGSA) and their

concessionary companies (the license holders for marinas or ski resorts, motorways and
toll roads, security, cultural installations or the cleaning of public roads, among others)
when they manage or undertake the service conceded, use Catalan in their actions and
in internal documents, on signs and also in communications and notifications, covering
bills addressed to persons residing in the Catalan linguistic area Catalan (Article 30
LPL).

With respect to public service companies, such as those of transport services (buses,
trains, aviation), supplies (water, gas, electricity) or communications (telephone, postal
service), legislation defines the obligation to use at least Catalan in signs and publicaddress systems, as well as in written communications and notifications, covering bills
addressed to persons resident in Catalonia, without adversely affecting their right to
receive them in Spanish if so requested (Article 31 LPL), and on the condition that, if this
concerns services provided directly by the state, such as the case of RENFE, Correos y
Telégrafos and AEROPUERTOS ESPAÑOLES DE NAVEGACIÓN AÉREA, among
others, it is the former which must provide the necessary measures for fulfilling this
mandate, which in effect is fulfilled by these companies.

Linguistic Clauses incorporated into the Specifications of Administrative Contract
Clauses of the Government of Catalonia

Through recommendation 2/2005 of 5 May of the Permanent Commission of the
Consultative Board of Administrative Contracts, the inclusion of linguistic clauses in public
contracts was distributed and generalised, as agreed by the Government of Catalonia on
30 November of 2004.

This agreement of the Government of Catalonia seeks to give a new impulse to the policy
of fostering the presence of Catalan in public contracts, which began in February 2003. As
417

such, the agreement established that the competent bodies of the Administration of the
Government of Catalonia and of the bodies which are affiliated or associated must include
the following provisions in those contract documents used for administrative contracts:
•

To establish as a condition for the execution of the contract, the obligation to use Catalan
on signs, in publications and in notifications and in documents addressed to the public
when these have a direct relationship with the execution of the services covered by the
contract.

•

To specifically mention those obligations which the Law on Linguistic Policy and the
regulations which develop it impose on the winners of administrative contracts.

•

To incorporate as a condition for the execution of the contract, the obligation to use
Catalan in those cases in which language may form a part, either directly or indirectly, of
the product or service, in accordance with criteria of proportionality and modulation
guidelines by the Consultation Board of Administrative Contracts.

•

To establish as a reason for the termination of the contract, the breach of these
obligations in those cases in which the breach has a direct relationship with the execution
of the services covered in the contract.

This measure seeks to use the capacity of influence which the Administration of the
Government of Catalonia may have as a client in order to create a demand for products and
services which use Catalan on their labelling, their packaging and information for users, such
that the offer of products in Catalan increases on the market and that all consumers may
finally benefit. Therefore, the final goal of the incorporation of linguistic clauses in
administrative contracts is not limited to guaranteeing the use of Catalan in consumption
pertaining to the administrative bodies of the Catalan Government, it involves the creation of
an influence which transcends the contractual area and which has an effect on society as a
whole.

The Commission for Monitoring the Clauses in the Use of Catalan in Public Contracts was
created (CSCUCAT). This monitoring began in 2006 and in 2008 evaluation was
concluded with an application report which reveals the following:
-

With respect to the evaluation of the fulfilment of the recommendation:

• The inclusion of the clauses in the specifications is widespread.
• The inclusion of an specific reference to the fulfilment of the linguistic clause in the
certificates of reception, recommended by the CSCUCAT, is partial.

418

• The execution of the contract termination clause due to a breach of the linguistic
clause has not been undertaken in any case.
• It has not been necessary to apply the modulation criteria for the clauses as
established in the 2/2005 Recommendation. These modulation criteria provide levels
with which to modulate linguistic demand in a manner distinct to that proposed as
standard practice in the clause.

-

With respect to the impact of the application of the linguistic clauses in contracts on

supply companies:
• All departments agree that the inclusion of linguistic clauses has not created
problems with regard to a reduction of provisions.
• No case challenging the linguistic clauses included in the contract specifications has
taken place, either in the administrative or judicial sector.
• In spoken communication between the contract bodies with supply companies,
complaints have not been registered with respect to the inclusion of of linguistic
clauses and the general view is that they have been received without problems by the
affected sector.
• Difficulties have occurred in some cases, with respect to the translation of instruction
manuals for determined products in which the company subject to the contract was
the distributor rather than the manufacturer.

-

With respect to the evaluation of the effective fulfilment of the linguistic clauses

included in the contract specifications:
• The information gathered reveals a high level of fulfilment in the use of Catalan in
written documents, however it is certain that there is less oral use, especially in the
services of the security and restaurant-catering sector in the public domain.

-

With respect to the scope of the final objective sought by the government

agreement:
• Supply companies have naturally accepted the inclusion of linguistic clauses and the
capacity of the government, as a client, to determine what it purchases with respect
to determined requirements.
• In some cases, the incorporation of linguistic clauses in contracts has initiated the
practice of including linguistic fulfilment required in oral services as an indicator of
service quality.
419

• In the award structure for restaurant service contracts in the public domain or in the
social services, the difficulty of reconciling the need to label products in Catalan with
the requirement of awarding bids to the lowest bidder has been noted.
• With respect to security services, a deficiency has been noted in the linguistic
competence in Catalan of staff. As such, the linguistic clause has already been
included in the contract specifications for these services and non-fulfilment may
therefore be a cause of termination.

Conclusions

• It is too soon to evaluate the effects which they will have in terms of determined
results and direct impact on private consumption; taking into account the fact that the
acquirement of a large number of products with greater impact in general
consumption is undertaken in a centralised manner, for multi-annual periods and it
has therefore been necessary to wait until 2007-2008 for the application of new
contracts with this linguistic clause.
• However, determined successes may already be noted, such as in the automobile
sector, which has included Catalan in its instruction manuals for vehicles and
mopeds, after undertaking contracts with the Catalan Government, such that these
instructions are now at the services of the public. Success has also been confirmed
with office equipment, such as photocopiers, printers and faxes made by various
commercial brands, which have incorporated Catalan into their dialogue screens with
the user in determined models offered to the public after the contract requirements
made by the Catalan Government.
• Also noteworthy is the inclusion of linguistic clauses in the Single Plan for Works and
Services of Catalonia (PUOSC) for the current four-year period, which will involve the
extension of the application of the 2/2005 Recommendation of the JCCA in local
public contracts financed according to the structure of the economic cooperation
between the Catalan Government and councils, which the PUOSC itself entails.

In the second semester of 2008, in view of the aforementioned conclusions, and with
regard to the need to adapt the 2/2005 Recommendation to the new basic legislation on
public contracts; work on the drafting of a new recommendation was undertaken, the
1/2009 Recommendation of 30 July which, on the writing of this report has been approved

420

and

which

may

Sub-paragraph c) Ensure that the social services, such as hospitals, old age persons
residences and shelters offer the possibility of receiving and attending the speakers of a
regional or minority language who need care for reasons of health, age or other reasons in
their language;

The Government of Catalonia promotes the impulse of measures which foster and ensure
the use of the Catalan language in the centres, services and establishments of Catalonia.
To this end the Government of Catalonia regularly organises general courses of Catalan
for staff who work in health centres, in addition to specific courses which are adapted to
the needs of the various health groups and courses which specialise in the terminology of
health-related sciences.

With respect to health services in hospitals in the Public Hospital Network of Catalonia
(XHUP) and primary care centres (CAP) which are not managed by the Catalan Institute of
Health, CatSalut (Catalan Health Centre Service) service contracts include a linguistic
standardisation clause which establishes the obligatory nature of undertaking the activity
habitually in Catalan, respecting the right of the individual to a linguistic option, in
accordance with the provisions and directives which relate to the use of the official
languages in Catalonia. In accordance with this, Catalan must be used in signs,
publications, notifications and all activities which bodies which provide services under
CatSalut undertake.

The official sociolinguistic data available (2003) show that in the health sector, the use of
Catalan in signs is above 90%. More than 70% of general and personalised written
communications in this sector are in Catalan. The lowest figure for the use of Catalan is in
oral communication, which is between 60% and 67%.

Sub-paragraph d) To ensure, by the appropriate means, that safety instructions are also
written in the regional or minority languages;

The Labelling of Consumer Products

421

Technology provides formulas for labels to be made in a satisfactory manner for the
different agents involved in the consumer process (manufacturers, distributors and the
final receivers of a product), however, those products with name and details in Catalan are
scarce. Those of a traditionally-made character, with a denomination of origin, produced in
determined counties and those of a high standard are the exception to this judgement.

Article 34 of the above-mentioned law regulates labels, packaging and instructions for the
use of general consumer products which are sold in Catalonia. It determines that
information and data may be provided in Catalan. However, neither the legal structure
which enacts the determination of the Catalan Government to encourage this, nor
favourable opinion from either consumers or business executives achieve a positive result
in this respect.

Sub-paragraph e) To facilitate in the regional or minority languages, the information
provided by the competent authorities on the rights of consumers.

The actions of the Catalan Consumer Agency with respect to linguistic regulation in the
socio-economic sector.

The Catalan Consumer Agency (ACC) was created through Law 9/2004 of 24 December
and is assigned all the authority of the Government of Catalonia with respect to
consumers, which includes jurisdiction relating to information, training, education,
mediation, arbitration, market discipline, inspection, the enactment of regulations,
promotion and institutional relations.

Law 3/1993 of 5 March of the Consumer Statute, devotes Chapter IV to the linguistic rights
of consumers and Chapter V to offences and penalties. The authority to impose penalties
is that of the ACC.
During these years the ACC has continued with a series of actions which are aimed at the
fulfilment of linguistic legislation. These actions have fundamental, complementary and
often overlapping foundations: the publication of information on linguistic rights and duties
and the monitoring of the fulfilment of this specific legislation. One of the fundamental
channels for the publication of information is the ACC website, where, among the
consumer subjects concerned, is a specific space dedicated to linguistic rights which
covers consumers and users:

422

The Application of Article 14

The parties agree:

Sub-paragraph a) To apply the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which link
them with the states in which the same language is spoken in an identical or similar
manner, or which seek to bring them to a conclusion if necessary, such that they
encourage contacts between the speakers of the same language in the corresponding
states in the areas of culture, teaching, information, professional education and permanent
education;
Sub-paragraph b) For the benefit of the regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or
promote cross-border cooperation, particularly between regional or local groups in whose
areas the same language is spoken in an identical or similar manner.

Cross-border Cooperation for the Promotion and Divulgation of Catalan

Article 6.4 of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia establishes the following mandate for
cooperation: “The Catalan Government must promote communication and cooperation with
other communities and other territories which share linguistic heritage with Catalonia. To this
end, the Government of Catalonia and the state, where applicable, may sign agreements,
pacts and other cooperative mechanisms for the promotion and overseas divulgation of
Catalan”.

Article 12 of the same Catalan statutory text, which is dedicated to historical, linguistic and
cultural links with Catalonia states the following:

"The Government of Catalonia must promote the communication, cultural exchange and
cooperation with communities and territories belong or which may not belong to the
Spanish state which have historical, linguistic and cultural links with Catalonia. To this
end, the Government of Catalonia and the state, where applicable, may sign agreements,

423

pacts and other instruments of cooperation in all those areas which may include the
creation of common bodies".

The Law on Linguistic Policy in Catalonia establishes, in its Second Additional Stipulation,
in order to facilitate the adoption of common policies which may contribute to overcome
the deficit in the use and status of Catalan, that the Government of Catalonia must
promote agreements, pacts and treaties with the Aragonese, Balearic and Valencian
autonomous communities and the Andorran, French and Italian states in order to foster
cultural interchange between countries where Catalan is spoken. In accord with this
regulation, the Government of Catalonia maintains cooperative relations with other
institutions in areas where Catalan is spoken.

The French Department of the Eastern Pyrenees (France)

In February 2005 the Servei de Difusió de la Llengua Catalana (Divulgation Service of the
Catalan language) was opened in the House of the Government of Catalonia in Perpignan.
The main objective of this service is to assess and to help institutions, associations and
companies with respect to the use of Catalan. The Catalan Government also helps
Perpignan city council in joint actions which promote the use of Catalan.

On 29 June 2006 a framework agreement on cross-border cooperation was signed
between the General Council of the Eastern Pyrenees and the Government of Catalonia,
which stipulated the objective of initiating close, cross-border cooperation between both
institutions in order to facilitate cross-border exchanges between the counties of Girona
and the French Department of the Eastern Pyrenees. The agreement seeks to improve the
daily life of inhabitants and to construct a proper cross-border space of common life with a
real cultural and linguistic community. The signing of the framework agreement also
sought joint participation in advancing towards the preparation of the new 2007-2013
European Programme.

The Government of Catalonia cooperates in the same way with the Catalan University of
Verano de Prada (France)

The Balearic Islands
During this triennium, the Balearic Islands has adhered to the Cooperation Agreement with
424

respect to Linguistic Policy which was signed by Catalonia, the Basque Country and
Galicia. Among its objectives, in addition to the promotion of their respective languages in
the state and abroad, is that of cooperating and exchanging experiences with respect to
linguistic policy and to promote their linguistic heritage abroad.

The Cooperation Agreement with respect to Linguistic Policy between the governments of
Catalonia and the Balearic Islands was initially formalised on 17 April of the year 2000, in
order to make the most of the efforts of both governments to promote the language. In this
stable cooperative framework, joint actions in various fields have been undertaken, such
as the divulgation of the terminology created by TERMCAT; cooperation with respect to
the film industry, which facilitates the showing of films dubbed into Catalan in the Balearic
Islands, with the support of the Catalan Government and cooperation in the area of
technical staff and joint publications.

The Valencian Community

Relationships in terms of language with the Valencian Community are upheld through the
Valencian universities, with respect to cooperation with universities, the cooperation
undertaken by TERMCAT must be noted with respect to terminology as well as that of the
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Government of Catalonia with those Catalan selflearning centres which are dependent on Valencian universities.

The Principality of Andorra

Catalonia has also cooperated with the Government of Andorra, through the Ramon Llull
Institute in the organisation of a campus aimed at university students from around the
world, who study Catalan in a faculty located in a non-Catalan speaking area. This
initiative seeks to offer students three weeks of linguistic immersion.

The Government of Catalonia has also cooperated with the Government of Andorra in the
publication of a collection of texts called Català fácil (Easy Catalan). This collection seeks
to facilitate reading in Catalan language for learners, through the adaptation of recognised
and famous Catalan or foreign literary works to different learning levels. Cooperation is
also undertaken with the Government of Andorra in the maintenance of three self-learning
centres in Andorra.
425

The Xarxa Vives

The Xarxa Vives (The Vives Network) is a non-profit making association of universities
which promotes relationships between the university institutions of Catalonia, the
Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, the French Department of the Eastern
Pyrenees and Andorra in order to create a university space which coordinates teaching,
investigation and cultural activities, while promoting the use and the standardisation of the
Catalan language. The network now comprises 20 universities with a total of over 400,000
students and 30,000 teachers.

This university network provides more than 1,400 courses, 300 of which are diplomas, 360
are degrees and 740 are doctorate programmes, while 60 study courses and 930 master's
and postgraduate courses are also offered.

3.1.2. THE BALEARIC ISLANDS

INTRODUCTION

In the first part of this report on the use of Catalan in the Autonomous Community of the
Balearic Islands, answers are given to questions from the Committee of Experts which are
not answered in the contents of the report. These questions are as follows:

Question nº 25 of the Committee of Experts. What is the impact on the Catalan language
of the new Statute of Autonomy? Could the Committee of Experts provide information on
its implementation?

As the General Administration of the Linguistic Policy of the Government of the Balearic
Islands has been able to observe, the new statute has not had any impact on the Catalan
language, or if it has had impact, this has been minimal.

Question nº 756 of the Committee of Experts. The Committee of Experts has requested
the authorities to communicate their observations on the matter of the prohibition made by
the police (the Civil Guard) to an Arabic and Tamazight interpreter regarding the use of
426

Catalan and the conviction of this person by the courts, as this person would have decided
to speak a language which was not understood by the civil servants.

After contacting the Office of Linguistic Rights of the Balearic Cultural Association (which
the interpreter contacted in order to report employment discrimination for linguistic
reasons), we were informed that this case has not yet been brought to trial. It must be
noted that the interpreter was working for the Civil Guard and not the National Police
Force.

The Application of Article 8

Paragraph 1. With respect to teaching and with regard to that which refers to the area in
which the above-mentioned languages are spoken, and according to the situation of each
of these, without prejudice to the teaching of the official state language or languages, the
parties agree to:

Paragraph 1 Measures:

sub-paragraph a)
i) provide a guaranteed pre-school education in the corresponding regional or minority
languages;

sub-paragraph b)
i) provide a guaranteed primary school education in the corresponding regional or
minority languages; or

sub-paragraph c)
i) provide a guaranteed secondary school education in the corresponding regional or
minority languages;

Catalan in pre-school, primary, secondary and pre-university education
The regulatory legal structure for education in the Balearic Islands establishes that:

427

e) Pupils cannot be separated for reasons of language, i.e. all pupils, regardless of their
origin or of the moment when they were incorporated into the educational system of the
Balearic Islands, must be fluent in the two official languages of our autonomous
community at the end of their compulsory education. The educational centres are
responsible for applying the appropriate strategies in order to attain this objective.
f) The linguistic project of the centre forms part of its educational project and must take
into consideration all regulations when being drafted.
g) The linguistic project of the centre is drafted by a commission and approved by the
school council, the highest governmental body in the educational centre, in which the
entire school community participates (mothers and fathers, pupils, service staff and the
council).
h) Basically, the regulation which governs the linguistic project of the centre is that
established by Law 3/1986 of 29 April, on the Linguistic Normalisation of the Balearic
Islands (Article 1.2):
• To make the progressive and normal use of the Catalan language effective in the
official and administrative areas.
• To ensure the understanding and the progressive use of Catalan as the vehicular
language in the area of education.

In this way, at least 50% of school subjects must be taught in Catalan. Fathers, mothers or
legal tutors may choose the first teaching language in an individual manner; this involves
individualised treatment in one or another language. However, these children, when they
reach the first course of the first cycle of primary school, must be able to receive,at least
50% of their education in Catalan, regardless of the language which their legal guardians
have chosen for their initial education.

The objective is to ensure that the children learn to speak, write and understand the two
official languages. It must be noted that the so-called Decree of Trilingualism, which the
experts mention in their report, was revoked by Decree 67/2008, of 6 June.

With respect to the demand for understanding the two official languages by the teaching
staff of the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture, it must be said that no primary or
secondary school teacher may take the professional entrance exams if he or she does not
possess linguistic resources in both official languages of the autonomous community.

428

The Directorate General of Innovation and Teacher Training initiated the Plan for
Reception, Integration and Educational Reinforcement (PAIRE) during the 2008-2009
course; which brings together twelve actions, measures and specific programmes which
seek to improve attention for late-entry students in the education system of the Balearic
Islands. More than 4,000 students from 8 to 16 years of age, from 178 educational centres
in the Balearic Islands have benefited from this programme.

This plan has become a fundamental instrument for the development of those necessary
actions which will facilitate the equal treatment of different cultures, and will strengthen
social integration and the capacity of students to learn to live together in culturally diverse
contexts.

The PAIRE has been conceived as a broad-ranging plan which covers all those actions
which late-entry foreign students receive with respect to reception, language education,
the compensation of inequalities and school integration.

The Service of Education in Catalan, which belongs to the General Directorate of
Administration, Organisation and Educational Inspection carries out the following actions
for the protection and promotion of Catalan:

9. The publication of teaching materials suited to the educational needs of the school
students.
10. Direct assessment is offered to 180 infant and primary education centres; this involves
the Support Team for Teaching in Catalan, with offices in Palma, Inca, Manacor,
Menorca and Ibiza, which is formed by ten assessors.
11. The actions of the linguistic normalisation coordinators for the compulsory secondary
education centres of the Balearic Islands are assessed and planned.
12. The coordination of linguistic volunteers in the secondary education centres. During the
2008-2009 Course 19 centres have undertaken voluntary linguistic initiatives among
students.
13. Families and educational centres are assessed with respect to the treatment of the
languages in the framework of a multi-lingual reality in order to channel those initiatives
which focus on the linguistic normalisation of the Catalan language.
14. The management of all standardisation documents for the teaching of the Catalan
language with the regulated educational courses.
429

15. The promotion and coordination of the Xarxa (Network) programme – materials are
used through a distance program via Internet. The materials are published in Catalan.
16. Together with the Educational Information Technology Service, a Catalan learning
program has been initiated in line with the objective of facilitating understanding and
the practice of basic abilities.

The Service of Educational Inspection of the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture is
involved in the centres to ensure the fulfilment of applicable norms with respect to teaching
in Catalan and the investigation undertaken by the Department of Educational Inspection
with regard to the reality of teaching in Catalan and the real development of the linguistic
projects of the educational centres.

In the area of formal teaching in the Balearic Islands, the Consortium for the Promotion of
Catalan (COFUC) has carried out various initiatives.

The following activities have been undertaken for the Linguistic Reception Project:
• A complementary activity to linguistic reception during the school course. A training
activity is organised which is complementary to the PALIC programme or the Reception
Class.
• A linguistic reception activity (for pupils between 12 and 18 years of age) during the
summer.

The following activities have been undertaken to promote reading:
The Reading School

The Reading School Programme seeks to promote the habit of reading and consolidate
linguistic abilities in Catalan among the school population of the Balearic Islands, from
infant education to secondary education, both in public education centres and in private
and subsidized centres.

In order to attain these objectives, the Consortium (COFUC) offers two types of materials;
book bags, as part of a loan scheme, which are available to infant, primary and secondary
schools and reading books.
430

Book Bags

The book bags contain books, various materials and educational proposals for working in
the classroom. They are focused on infant and primary education and the first cycle of
secondary education. The books created for infant education are: A selection of short
stories Biblioteca de aula, La rabosa i l’eriçó (a story) and La rateta que agranava
l’escaleta (a play); for primary education: La rabosa i l’eriçó (a story), La rateta que
agranava l’escaleta (a play), La filla del carboneret (a story), Na Ventafocs (a play), En
Gostí lladre (a story) and Aladí i la llàntia meravellosa (a play); for secondary education
Entre el cel la terra (narrative), L’anell de Boken-Rau (narrative) and Les noces del cel i de
la terra (narrative).

Reading Books

The reading books seek to bring secondary school pupils closer to classical and
contemporary authors from the islands. They comprise 6 reading guides: El bloc del
bogamarí, El raïm del Sol i de la Lluna, Memorial de Tabarka, Isidor Macabich, Salvador
Galmés and Joan Ramis i Ramis.

The Consortium (COFUC) has published plays and teaching material (support boxes and
theatre play boxes) which form part of the content of the bags and the reading books. With
respect to books with adaptations of stories, it has published: La rabosa i l’eriçó, La filla del
carboneret, En Gostí lladre, La cadernera and En Pere de la favera. These books are
accompanied by support boxes for the adaptations of the stories of the same title.

It has also published the teaching book and the support file El capell volador. Other
publications have been dedicated to theatrical adaptations, such as La rateta que
agranava l’escaleta, Aladí i la llàntia meravellosa, Na Ventafocs and Na Blancaneu. At the
same time tool boxes have been created for the adaptations of plays which bear the same
titles as the books. With respect to reading books, works by the following authors have
been re-published: Joan Cardona, Isidor Macabich, Ponç Pons and Miquel Rayó.

sub-paragraph d)

431

i) establish a guaranteed technical and professional education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages;

The Directorate General of Teaching Staff, employees of the Regional Ministry of
Education and Culture, published a resolution in the Official Gazette of the Balearic Islands
(the last edition was published on 10 October 2009), signed by their director, which
establishes the bases for the regulation of the convocation of the list of candidates to
provisionally cover substitutions in all speciality areas in non-university public educational
centres which are dependent on the Regional Ministry of Education and Culture of the
Government of the Balearic Islands in an interim policy. The regulation establishes that
knowledge of Catalan must be verified in all speciality areas in public centres.

Catalan courses have been held and organised by municipal bodies, non-profit
associations and trade unions and these have benefited from the series of subsidies which
the Directorate General of Linguistic Policy implemented for this purpose.

sub-paragraph e)
iii) if, due to the role of the state with respect to higher education centres, sections i) and
ii) cannot be applied, the promotion and/or authorisation of the establishment of university
education or other forms of higher education in the regional or minority languages, or of
means which allow these languages to be studied at university or in other higher education
centres will be undertaken;

Catalan in University Education

The University of the Balearic Islands (UIB) has organisational autonomy for the use of
Catalan in all areas of its authority, according to that established by Article 5 of Decree
170/2003 of 26 September 2003, which approved the statutes of the UIB:

The Catalan language used by the University of the Balearic Islands, has, together with
Spanish, the character of an official language and all members of the university have the
right to use it. The university will normalise the use of Catalan in the area of its
responsibilities.

432

The University of the Balearic Islands is also the official institution for consultations with
respect to Catalan. Article 6 of the above-mentioned decree states:
The University of the Balearic Islands is the official consultative institution for all that
which refers to the Catalan language, as established by the Statute of Autonomy of the
Balearic Islands.
As a language of common usage in its communications, its web page can be consulted at
www.uib.cat.

to make provisions so that courses for adult education or continual education are
undertaken mainly or totally in the regional or minority languages;

Article 6 of Law 4/2006 of 30 March, on education and continual training for adults in the
Balearic Islands establishes that:
With respect to the language, culture and society of the Balearic Islands
1. Within a multicultural world and in an autonomous state, the cultural, linguistic and
social reality of the Balearic Islands, due to its range and size, will be taken into
account in the development and the application of this law.
2. Those initiatives which promote the preservation and the development of the Catalan
language and the culture of the Balearic Islands will be considered as priority actions in
this area.
3. The public administration bodies of the Balearic Islands will ensure that those bodies
and centres dedicated to educational activities for adults undertake initiatives and
educational courses related to the Catalan language of the Balearic Islands and the
culture, the economy and the society of the Balearic Islands.
4. The public administration bodies of the Balearic Islands will promote the
understanding of our linguistic and cultural reality.
5. The Public Administration Bodies of the Balearic Islands will facilitate, by means of
different programmes, the development of the sense of citizenship among the adult
population, so that they may actively participate in equal terms in the access to cultural,
economic and social assets and services.

The Consortium (COFUC), in the area of non-regulated linguistic education for adults in
the Balearic Islands has fostered the organisation of courses, seminars, conferences, selflearning centres and all types of educational techniques and strategies. It has undertaken
different activities.

Catalan Language Courses
The COFUC Consortium has organised Catalan language courses in different modes:
non-intensive class-based courses for adults in Catalan for initial, elementary, medium and
higher levels; intensive class-based courses for adults in Catalan for initial, elementary,
medium and higher levels; Catalan language distance courses for elementary and medium
levels; and Catalan language courses for foreigners, for Levels 1 and 2. It has also
436

undertaken courses for parents which are held in the same schools, where their children
study in order to facilitate their access to the Catalan language.

Catalan Language Self-learning Centres and Points
Since 2004 the COFUC Consortium has administered the CAL centres and the PAL selflearning points. These are areas which are equipped with means and materials to facilitate
the individualised learning of Catalan and which adjust to the needs and the personal
rhythm of each student. Different centres have been created throughout all the islands: the
CAL of Llevant (Palma), the CAL University of the Balearic Islands (Palma), the CAL Ibiza
and thel CAL Francesc de Borja Moll (Ciutadella); and the self-learning points: the PAL
Emili Darder, the PAL Son Dureta, the PAL of Alcudia, the PAL of Sant Antoni de
Portmany, the PAL of Santa Eulària des Riu, the PAL of Formentera, the PAL of Son
Servera and the PAL of Sant Josep de Sa Talaia.

The Catalan Language Educational Programme (The PELC)

The PELC is an Internet-based Catalan self-learning programme. It is an online resource
for learning Catalan.

sub-paragraph g: take measures to ensure the education of the history and the culture of
that which is the expression of the regional or minority language;

The teaching of the history and culture of the Balearic Islands is included in all the
curricular itineraries of the various education levels detailed in the previous sections.

The Department of Educational Inspection of the Regional Ministry of Education and
Culture intervenes in order to ensure the fulfilment of the applicable norms with respect to
teaching in Catalan. This same department monitors education in Catalan in the centres
and the real development of the linguistic projects in centres.

sub-paragraph h: guarantee the initial and permanent education of the teaching staff
necessary for the application of that established in paragraphs a) to g) which the party has
accepted;

437

The plan for recycling and linguistic and cultural education is established in the ruling of
the Ministry of Education and Culture of 20 August 2008, and the qualifications required
are determined for the teaching of classes in and of the Catalan language in the nonuniversity educational centres of the Balearic Islands. All teaching staff must pass a
specific seminar on the history and geography of the Balearic Islands.

sub-paragraph i: to create one or several control bodies responsible with the monitoring
of the adopted measures and of the progress made in the establishment or development
of the teaching of the regional or minority languages and to write periodical reports which
will be made public.

paragraph 2: With respect to education and with regard to that which refers to territories
different from those in which the regional or minority languages are traditionally spoken,
the parties agree to authorise, foster or establish the teaching of or in the regional or
minority language, at those levels which are considered appropriate, if the number of
speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

In 2008, the Government of the Balearic Islands was readmitted as part of the Ramon Llull
Institute (IRL), and took on the functions of this institute with respect to the projection of
the Catalan language and of the culture expressed in it.
The IRL promotes the presence, the investigation and the learning of Catalan and its
reality in universities throughout the world, it fosters investigation work on Catalan
language and culture and provides support and encouragement to Catalan entities.
In this section the agreement signed in 2008 with the Associació d’Amics de la Bressola
(The Association of Friends of La Bressola) should be mentioned, which fosters teaching
in Catalan in the French Department of the Eastern Pyrenees.

The Application of Article 9
Paragraph 1. The parties agree, with respect to that which refers to the area divisions of

For the teaching of the co-official language in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic
Islands, specific collaborative agreements have been established which are signed each
year and which have been signed since 1996 by the INAP and the Regional Ministry of the
Interior of the Balearic Islands, as part of the development of the corresponding structural
agreement which was signed on 5 April 1989, with the participation of the government
delegation in the programming of the courses and the selection of students.

Islands. The General Directorate of Linguistic Policy has sent a leaflet to all autonomous
community employees which explains how this decree should be applied. During 2008, the
Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands adopted the linguistic and cultural domain
“.cat” for its web page, at www.illesbalears.cat.

454

The General Directorate of Mobility for the Regional Ministry of Transport and Territorial
Planning of the Government of the Balearic Islands is reintroducing Catalan as the main
language of communication with users of Balearic Islands transportation.

With the transfer of the Indexplà website tool by the Catalan Government, the General
Directorate of Linguistic Policy will be able to evaluate the use of Catalan in the
autonomous administrative bodies.

Article 14 of Law 3/1986 of 29 April on the linguistic standardisation of the Balearic Islands
refers to toponyms, as can be seen in the previous section.

The Application of Article 11

Paragraph 1. For the speakers of regional or minority languages, in the territories in which
these languages are spoken, in accordance with the situation of each one of these and to
the extent that the public authorities, in a direct or indirect manner have the authority,
attributions or a role to play in the aforementioned area, while respecting the principles of
independence and autonomy of the communication media, the parties agree:

Sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent in which the radio and the television have a public
service role, a: to guarantee the creation of at least one radio station and one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph b, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station in
the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

c, i) to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television

channel in the regional or minority languages;

The public body Radiotelevision of the Balearic Islands (EPRTVIB) was founded on 26
March 2004, in the development of the law of its creation in May 1985, integrating the
autonomous public radio and television companies under the company name IB3.

455

The current model of IB3 offers all of its programmes in Catalan, using standard Catalan in
all its productions, as this is another variety of Catalan which the speakers of the language
may use in a formal space such as that offered by a public communications channel.

Since 2008 the University of the Balearic Islands (as the institution of maximum reference
in terms of linguistic matters) provides services of linguistic assessment to the public body
Radiotelevision of the Balearic Islands.

Apart from RTVE, which applies a brief disconnection (changeover of transmission) from
its state (Spanish) programming, which is broadcast in Catalan, no other state area
channel will be compelled to use Catalan in its habitual programming. The use of Catalan
will be limited to autonomous, island and local television channels and those from other
Catalan-speaking territories. The TV3 signal received in the Balearic Islands today is that
broadcast internationally.

The presence of the Catalan language in DTT in the local television channels of the
Balearic Islands is regulated by Decree 31/2006 of the 31st of March by the Government
of the Balearic Islands, which regulates the legal system of DTT concessions in the area of
the Balearic Islands. The text established the demand level of the language in the
broadcasts of these channels, which must be at least 51%, of the broadcasting time in
each one of the time slots.

The agreement on audiovisual material which was signed by the Government of the
Balearic Islands and the Catalan Government has been mentioned previously.

The General Directorate of Linguistic Policy promotes the broadcasting of Real Mallorca
football team matches in Catalan on the COPE Mallorca radio station and two
programmes (Calaix de sastre, which deals with linguistic problems, and disconnection
(transmission changeover) programmes which broadcast music in Catalan) on the same
station in Menorca.

Sub-paragraph d: to foster and/or facilitate the production and dissemination of audio
and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

456

The production and dissemination of audio and audiovisual works in the regional or
minority languages is fostered and facilitated through subsidies from the Ramon Llull
Institute, the Institute of Balearic Studies and the General Directorate of Culture.

As responsibilities in cultural matters are transferred to each one of the four island
councils, these are largely responsible for the promotion of the production and
broadcasting of audio and audiovisual works.

Sub-paragraph e, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at least
one press body in the regional or minority languages;

The General Directorate of Linguistic Policy has signed an annual subsidy agreement with
the Press Association of Mallorca (Associació de Premsa Forana de Mallorca) which
produces some fifty publications in Catalan. This same Directorate General offers a series
of subsidies for publications written entirely in Catalan. In 2009 41 requests were
presented and 39 written publications were included in this line of subsidies.

All the contract awards for subsidies with respect to the communications media offered by
the General Directorate of Communication of the Regional Ministry of the Presidency give
higher scores to those media which demonstrate a greater use of Catalan.

Sub-paragraph f, ii): to extend the existing measures of financial assistance for
audiovisual productions in regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for those
communications media which use the regional or minority languages.

Paragraph 2: The parties agree to guarantee the freedom of direct reception for radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language which is spoken in an
identical or similar manner to a regional or minority language, and to not oppose the
broadcasting of radio and television broadcasts of neighbouring countries in this language.

457

They are also obliged to ensure that no restriction on the freedom of expression and the
free circulation of information in a language spoken in an identical or similar manner to a
regional or minority language is imposed. The exercise of the freedoms mentioned above,
which entail duties and responsibilities, may be subject to certain procedures, conditions,
restrictions or sanctions established by the law, which constitute necessary measures in a
democratic society for national security, territorial integrity or public safety, the defence of
order and the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morality, the protection of
reputation or the rights of others, in order to prevent the disclosure of confidential
information or to guarantee the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary.

Paragraph 3: The parties agree to ensure that the interests of the speakers of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into consideration in the framework of the
structures which may be created in compliance with the law, in order to guarantee the
freedom and plurality of the media.

This information is not possessed by the Government of the Balearic Islands, given that a
socio-linguistic survey should be held with regard to this matter; this is a measure which
has not been undertaken.

Finally, the General Directorate of Linguistic Policy has commissioned a survey to be
carried out by Ibestat (The Statistical Institute of the Balearic Islands). The proposed
questionnaire seeks to evaluate the current situation of Catalan in the Balearic Islands in
order to compare the data with other previous surveys. It also seeks to obtain information
on the understanding, the use and the attitudes of the public with respect to Catalan.

The Application of Article 12

Paragraph 1. With respect to activities and cultural services, especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, in
addition to literary works and film production, traditional cultural expression, festivals,
cultural industries, including, in particular, the use of new technology, the parties, in what is
referred to as the territory in which the aforementioned languages are spoken, and to the
extent in which the public authorities have authority, attributions or a role to play in the
area, agree to:
458

Sub-paragraph a): foster the expression of - and initiatives in - the regional or minority
languages and aid the different means of access to works produced in these languages;

With reference to the autonomous community:
The General Directorate of Culture of the Government of the Balearic Islands seeks,
among other objectives, the promotion and divulgation of the culture of the Balearic
Islands. This means that in all the initiatives undertaken by this General Directorate there
is a special sensitivity to the use of the Catalan language.

The following actions must be emphasised in this area:
Publications
All the publications of books and bibliographic material produced by the General
Directorate

of Culture and by the cultural centres it administers are produced in the

Catalan language
•

The Promotion and Divulgation of the Fine Arts

The exhibitions organised by the General Directorate of Culture are undertaken in Catalan.
The catalogues and other informative material are printed in bilingual or even trilingual
versions (Catalan, Spanish, English).
•

The “Viu la Cultura” Programme

This programme uses Catalan exclusively, both in its activities and in catalogues and
printed informational material; it is aimed at showing students in educational centres of the
Balearic Islands the area’s historical and artistic heritage and its cultural reality through
cultural activities, visits to museums, cultural centres, etc.

Libraries
The libraries administered by the Directorate General of Culture of the Government of the
Balearic Islands undertake all their activities in Catalan and use this language in signs and
printed documents, etc. The acquisition of bibliographic funds for libraries is mainly
undertaken in Catalan.
459

Those libraries administered by the Government of the Balearic Islands hold copies of all
works published in Catalan.

Those libraries administered by the Government of the Balearic Islands participate in the
“You Ask” programme, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Culture with the
autonomous communities, which allows the public to access the libraries of different
autonomous communities via Internet, requesting information and communicating doubts
and other questions. Users can ask questions in Catalan.

•

Archives and Museums

All the publications, exhibitions and informative material produced by the archives and
museums administered by the Directorate General of Culture are in Catalan or where
applicable, in a bilingual or even trilingual version (Catalan, Spanish, English), and these
bodies use Catalan language in their other activities, printed documents, signs, etc.
•

Theatre, Music and Traditional Cultural Activities

The Directorate General of Culture promotes theatre, musical and traditional cultural
activities undertaken in Catalan without prejudice to the fact that some specific
representations may be made in Spanish, especially if held outside the area of the
Balearic Islands or in those areas where Catalan is spoken. The Directorate General of
Culture, in addition to promoting these activities, participates actively in the co-production
of works undertaken in Catalan.
•

Participation in Cultural Projects and Projects of Cultural Administration with
other Bodies

This administration body participates in those cultural projects and activities which lie
within its area of authority, such as participation in consortiums and foundations (the
Consortium of the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Palma, the Public
Foundation of the Balearic Islands for Music, the Consortium for the Promotion of the
Catalan Language and the Overseas Projection of the Culture of the Balearic Islands),
460

participation with other institutions and cultural centres, and it undertakes all its activities in
Catalan.
•

Promotional Activities

The Directorate General of Culture periodically facilitates subsidies for undertaking
activities which involve the promotion and the divulgation of the culture of the Balearic
Islands, both within its own territory and outside of it, either through the organisation of
fairs, festivals, competitions, the production of theatre plays, the shooting of short-films
and feature films, etc. All of these activities are undertaken in Catalan, except those which
are held in areas where Catalan is not spoken.
The Campaign for the Promotion of Reading, which was initiated jointly by the Government
of the Balearic Islands and by the Government of Catalonia, offers in the communications
media, sections from books in Catalan as samples of the literary works. This initiative is
called “Tasta’m” (“Try me”).

Another initiative undertaken by the Directorate General of Culture has been the naming of
the Writer of the Year. In 2009 Baltasar Porcel was nominated for this title. His works have
been widely publicised.

As mentioned above, as the island ministries or councils are responsible for the cultural
sector, these bodies also promote and divulge the culture of the Balearic Islands. The
Premis Mallorca de Creació Literària (The Mallorca Awards for Literary Creation) in
Catalan are noteworthy, which were created as the awards which provide the greatest
financial support in Catalan.

With respect to actions of the Ministry of Culture:

The Promotion of the Preservation, Divulgation and Understanding of the Co-official
Languages

In 2007 competitive subsidies were provided through the General Administration for
Cultural Cooperation and Communication of the Ministry of Culture for the financing of
461

investment projects of cultural institutions which promote the preservation, the divulgation
and the understanding of Catalan in the Balearic Islands, with a maximum attributable total
which reached 1,000,000 euros.

These subsidies continued in 2009 through a nominative grant for cultural works from the
Balearic Islands of 500,000 € for the linguistic promotion of the Catalan language.

The Promotion of Film and Audiovisual Media

Current Legislation on the Subject

Law 55/2007 of 28 December on Film, in Article 36 establishes that:

“In order to attend to the promotion and protection of the use of the co-official
languages distinct to Spanish in films and audiovisual media, promoting the cultural
plurality of Spain and the equal opportunities of the languages of each territory with
respect to audiovisual expression and divulgation, a fund or subsidies or specific
credits will be established which will be transferred entirely to the competent bodies of
the autonomous communities which will administer them in accordance with their
powers. This state contribution, based on the principle of co-responsibility, will be
provided each year in the General State Budgets and will be destined to the
production, distribution, exhibition and promotion of the film and audiovisual industry in
the above-mentioned languages”.

The Additional Sixth Stipulation of the Law of Film, which relates to the agreements for the
fostering of film and audiovisual media in co-official languages distinct from Spanish,
establishes that:

“The Ministry of Culture, by agreement, will determine those credits established in
Article 36 of the Law, in a way such that the funding received by each autonomous
community in the co-official language, is the annual equivalent to the sum of
contributions which this community has made during the previous financial year for the
support and fostering of the production, distribution and promotion of the audiovisual
industry in the co-official language distinct to Spanish. The funding received by each
autonomous community will not exceed 50 percent of the total of the subsidies which
462

audiovisual companies resident in this community have received from the ICAA during
the previous financial year”.

Royal Decree 2062/2008 of the 12th of December, which modifies the Law of Film in
Article 19.3, regulates the above-mentioned Article 36.

Relevant actions undertaken

In the general state budgets for 2008 a subsidy of 2,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute (Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las
Artes Audiovisuales -ICAA) from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose and which was
transferred to the Balearic Islands for 29,750 €

In the general state budgets for 2009, a subsidy of 10,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the ICAA from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose, the distribution of this
subsidy will be processed once the corresponding agreements are approved and signed
by the parties.

Independently of that established in the Law of Film, Royal Decree 526/2002, of 14
December already established facilities for obtaining the subsidies for the amortization of
films made by producers who made films whose original version was in a co-official
language distinct from Spanish. These subsidies have been made available since 2003 to
the present.

The Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

In the subsidies open to competition in this area, the bases of the awards stipulate that
they are open to all the co-official languages of the state and aim to encourage private
intercommunication between the Spanish cultures. Members of business associations or
the academies of the above-mentioned languages form part of the evaluation committees
with respect to some of these subsidies:

Subsidies for non-profit companies and institutions, publishers of culture
magazines written in any co-official language of Spain. The objective of these subsidies

463

is to attain the free distribution of cultural magazines in the distinct official languages of
Spain in languages and cultural centres in Spain and abroad.
Subsidies for the promotion of reading and the divulgation of Spanish literature,
through the undertaking of activities which promote common Spanish culture in Spain
and abroad, through conferences, seminars, etc., the participation and celebration of
commemorations and centennials – especially of writers -, the fostering of reading
habits and the promotion of the use of public libraries. Activities in the co-official
languages take place in those which are subsidised every year.
Subsidies for the publication in any co-official language of Spain of literary works.
This convocation subsidises projects for publishing works from our culture, of national
and international projection in the co-official languages of Spain, which contribute to the
enrichment of our common bibliographic heritage, with the dual objective of extending
the funds of the public libraries of Spain and fostering and encouraging communication
and cultural cohesion between the autonomous communities, creating a common
bibliographic archive in all public libraries.

National Literature Awards

Regarding the national awards awarded by the Ministry of Culture, representatives of the
academies of the co-official languages are included, and in the criteria of these awards it is
established that works and authors in any of the Spanish languages may be proposed.
Many of these awards have been given to written works and authors who write in
languages other than Spanish.

The Promotion of the Scenic Arts and Music

During the 2006-2008 period, the Directorate General of the National Institute of the
Scenic Arts and Music (INAEM) has followed a policy to promote expression in the
regional languages of Spain in the awarding of subsidies for programmes of divulgation,
development and the preservation of the theatre and the circus and theatre and circusorientated communication.

This is established in the resolutions of the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music of
26 December 2005, of 26 February 2007 and of 8 February 2008, which make subsidies
available for programmes for the divulgation, development and preservation of the theatre
464

and the circus and theatre and circus-orientated communication for the years 2006, 2007
and 2008, respectively.

In this sense the requirements established for participating in the programme of theatre
divulgation in the national area are made flexible if the theatre productions are performed
solely in one of the official languages distinct from Spanish. This flexibility consists in the
non-application of two conditions which are compulsory for other requests: firstly, that
touring projects are undertaken in at least three autonomous communities, and in second
place, that at least 40% of the performances take place outside the autonomous
community which corresponds to the company address of the party requesting the
subsidy.

Sub-paragraph b): to encourage different means of access in other languages to works
produced in the regional or minority languages, aiding and developing the activities of
translation, dubbing, post-synchronistation and subtitling;

Sub-paragraph c): to encourage access in the regional or minority languages to works
produced in other languages, aiding and developing the activities of translation, dubbing,
post-synchronistation and subtitling;

With respect to actions of the Ministry of Culture:
2.The Translation of Published Works
The Ministry of Culture awards the following subsidies for translation each year:

Subsidies for the translation and publication in any foreign language of literary or
scientific works by Spanish authors which were originally written and published in any
of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture overseas and are open to any work from Spain written in any co-official
language.
Subsidies for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain
to other co-official languages of Spain which were originally written and published in
any of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish

465

culture in Spain. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.

Sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
various forms of cultural activities suitably integrate the understanding and the practice of
the languages and of the regional or minority cultures into the activities whose initiative
depends on these bodies or those bodies who provide their support for such activities.

Sub-paragraph e): to encourage the provision of staff who speak the regional or minority
language, in addition to the language(s) of the rest of the population to organisations
responsible for organising or supporting cultural activities;

Sub-paragraph f): to encourage the direct participation of speakers of the regional or
minority language, with respect to services and any cultural activity programmes;

Sub-paragraph

g): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of one or several bodies

responsible for gathering, receiving in bond and presenting or publishing the works
produced in regional or minority languages

With respect to actions of the Ministry of Culture:

1.The Deposit of Published Works

The National Library acts as the organisation for depositing works published in any
language within Spanish territory.

2.Reference collections

The National Library has reference collections in different subjects in all the co-official
languages of Spain.

Sub-paragraph h): where applicable, to create and/or promote and finance services of
translation and terminological investigation with a view to specifically maintaining and

466

developing, in each regional or minority language an appropriate administrative,
mercantile, economic, social or legal terminology.

Paragraph 2. With respect to those territories distinct from those in which the regional or
minority languages are traditionally used, the parties are obliged to authorise, foster and/or
plan appropriate activities or cultural services in compliance with the above paragraph if
the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

Paragraph 3: The parties agree, in their overseas cultural policy to provide a suitable
space for the regional or minority languages and to the culture which these express.

With respect to the Ministry of Culture:

2.Book Fairs and the Delivery of Bibliographic Packs to Cultural Centres

In international book fairs which Spain attends with its own pavilion, or through the
administration of embassies, new publications which are displayed will include books and
magazines in all the languages of Spain, partly from the subsidies provided to editors of
magazines and the publication of books. The same applies to the packs of books sent to
libraries and cultural centres.
Furthermore, with respect to the mobility of authors overseas in fairs, conferences, etc.,
Spanish authors will participate in these, regardless of the co-official language in which
they write.

With respect to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation:

The Cervantes Institute reports that it has signed various participatory agreements with
several cultural institutions for the divulgation of the co-official languages as part of
overseas cultural policy. This includes academic and teaching activities with the following
institutions: the Ramón Llull Institute, the Royal Academy of the Vasca-Euskaltzaindia
Language, the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language, the Galician Royal Academy of
Language and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Galician Government.

467

The Cervantes Institute has been offering courses for learning Catalan, Galician and
Basque since the academic year of 1994-1995. Several graphs are shown, detailing the
development of the courses held over the last few years.

The Application of Article 13

468

Paragraph 1. With respect to economic and social activities and for the entire countries,
the parties agree:

Sub-paragraph a) To exclude from their legislation all provisions which prohibit or limit
without justifiable reasons, the use of regional or minority languages in those documents
which relate to economic or social life and especially in work contracts and in technical
documents, such as in the instructions for the use of products or services;

Sub-paragraph b) To prohibit the insertion in the internal regulations of companies and in
private documents, clauses which exclude or limit the use of regional or minority
languages, at least among the speakers of the same language;

Sub-paragraph c) To oppose practices aimed at discouraging the use of regional or
minority languages in economic or social activities;

Sub-paragraph d) To facilitate and/or foster the use of regional or minority languages
through other means distinct to those considered in the above sections.

In the legislation of the Balearic Islands there is no legal stipulation which prohibits or limits
the use of the Catalan language.

Paragraph 2. With respect to economic and social activities and to the extent that the
public authorities are able, the parties, in the territory in which the regional or minority
languages are spoken and as far as is reasonably possible, agree:

Sub-paragraph a) to define, through their financial and banking regulations, modes which
allow, in conditions which are compatible with commercial use, the use of regional or
minority languages in the writing of payment orders (cheques, letters of exchange, etc.),
or other financial documents or, where applicable to ensure that these initiatives are put
into practice;

469

Sub-paragraph b) in economic and social sectors which directly depend on their control
(the public sector), to undertake actions which foster the use of the regional or minority
languages;

Sub-paragraph c) to ensure that social services, such as hospitals, elderly persons’
residences and shelters offer the possibility of being received and attended to in the
language of the speakers of a regional or minority language who may require care for
reasons of health, age or for other reasons;

Sub-paragraph d) to ensure, through the appropriate means, that safety instructions are
also written in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph e) to facilitate the information provided by the authorities responsible on
the rights of consumers in the regional or minority languages.

Article 8 of Law 11/2001 of 15 June on the Organisation of Commercial Activity in the
Balearic Islands, establishes:

The Linguistic Rights of Consumers
1. In those establishments regulated in this law, consumers have the right to be
attended to in one of the official languages of the Balearic Islands and they may not
be discriminated or attended to incorrectly because of the official language which
they use.
2. In those retail establishments which employ a staff of more than three workers,
consumers also have the right to be attended to in the official language of the
Balearic Islands which they choose.
3. Permanent informative signs, posters and documents which offer services for
consumers in establishments open to the public must be drawn up in Catalan at
least. This regulation does not apply to brands, commercial names and the signs
covered by legislation pertaining to industrial property. In the terms established by
regulations, commercial establishments will inform their customers of their linguistic
rights through the placement of the corresponding notifications.

470

4. The administrative bodies responsible will promote the progressive use of the
Catalan language in commercial activities in addition to its use in signs, symbols
and insignia of the commercial establishments of the Balearic Islands.

Furthermore, the General Plan of Linguistic Standardisation which was approved by the
Social Council of the Catalan Language on 18 June 2009, dedicated Area 5 to socioeconomic activities. Actions and objectives are envisaged for application in business
organisations, trade unions, private companies, public companies and concessionaries
and financial entities.

The Application of Article 14

The parties agree to:

Sub-paragraph a) apply the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which link them
with the states in which the same language is spoken in an identical or similar manner, or
to attempt to finalise these agreements where applicable, in such as way that these
agreements may encourage contacts between the speakers of the same language in the
corresponding states, in the areas of culture, teaching, information, job training and
continual education;

Sub-paragraph b) to facilitate and/or promote cooperation across borders to the benefit
of the regional or minority languages, especially among regional or local groups in whose
territories the same language is spoken in an identical or similar manner.

The Government of the Balearic Islands was readmitted as part of the Ramon Llull Institute
of which the Principality of Andorra and the City of Alghero also form a part, through the
Foundation of the Ramon Llull Institute.

The Balearic Islands, together with Aragon and Catalonia in addition to the French regional
councils of Languedoc-Roussillon and the Mid-Pyrenees, form part of the Pyrenees
Mediterranean Euro-Region which was created in 2004 in order to achieve political

471

coordination between the above-mentioned areas, and to promote territorial cooperation
projects in social, economic and institutional areas, among others.

Furthermore, the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands together with Catalonia
and the French Departments Languedoc-Roussillon and the Mid-Pyrenees, forms part of
the European Group of Territorial Cooperation (AECT) “Pyrenees Mediteranean” (2009),
which specifically seeks to plan, coordinate, develop, promote and organise its actions in
the areas defined in the protocol of October 2004 through which the above-mentioned
European Group of Territorial Cooperation was created, with the general objective of
strengthening the economic, social and territorial cohesion envisaged in the treaties of the
European Union. It should be noted that this group has established Catalan as a working
language in addition to Spanish and French.

472

3.2. GALICIAN (GALICIA)

In order to report on this language, consultations were made with respect to the Xunta de
Galicia (the Government of Galicia and regional administrative body), to the affected
ministries (state administration bodies), the Galician Royal Academy and the public body,
Spanish Radio Television (RTVE).

INTRODUCTION

In the Autonomous Community of Galicia, approximately two million people habitually
speak Galician, and half a million more use it as a second language. There are also
Galician speakers in the western areas of the neighbouring provinces of Asturias, Leon,
Zamora and in the municipal areas of Caceres. There are also significant centres of
Galician speakers due to Galician emigration in other regions of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona,
the Basque Country and the Canary Islands), in Europe (Portugal, France, Switzerland,
Germany, the United Kingdom and Holland) and in America (Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil,
Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico and the United States).

The Application of Article 8. Teaching.

Paragraph 1. With respect to teaching and with regard to that which refers to the area in
which the above-mentioned languages are spoken and according to the situation of each
of these, without prejudice to the teaching of the official state language or languages, the
parties agree to:

Paragraph 1 Measures:

Sub-paragraph a, i): provide a guaranteed pre-school education in the corresponding
regional or minority languages;

Law 3/1983 of 15 June on Linguistic Standardisation includes in Section III, those precepts
relating to the use of Galician in teaching. This law declares Galician to be an official
language in all the teaching levels in education, children have the right to receive their first
level of education in their maternal language. Students cannot be separated in different
473

centres due to reasons of language and as such, separation in different classes must
therefore be avoided. At the end of their education, students must understand Galician and
Spanish at oral and written levels in equal conditions.

The Galician language must be the subject of compulsory studies at all non-university
levels of education in both public and private centres. As an exception to this norm,
Decree 253/1990 of 18 April considers the possibility of granting waivers for certain
students when special circumstances apply.

During the 2007-2008 course, Decree 124/2007 of 28 June became applicable, through
which the use and the promotion of Galician in the educational system was regulated and
which developed the Law on Linguistic Standardisation for its application in in all public
and private teaching centres which carry out educational practices as regulated in Organic
Law 2/2006 of the 3 May, on Education. This decree establishes, for the second cycle of
infant education (from 3 to 6 years of age), that in Spanish speaking environments, the use
of the Galician language as a language of communication and teaching, must be at least
the same as that of Spanish. As such it stated that approaches to reading and writing in
Galician will be promoted in order to convert it into a language for the basis of learning,
such that students will achieve a level of competence which will allow them to
communicate normally in Galician with other students and the teaching staff.

Within this general framework, which has been created with the approval of Decree
124/2007 since the 2007-2008 academic year, in those schools with a first cycle of infant
education, an education course in Galicia is provided on the request of the centres and the
parents. These projects are aimed at educational centres which have more than one
teaching course, so that one course may be used for teaching in Galician. The conditions
required are as follows: the project must be in keeping with the socio-linguistic report of the
area where it is to be introduced and that once proposed by the faculty of the centre, it has
the support of the School Board.

The infant school network (Galescolas) is part of a specific area in the first cycle of primary
education, these schools began to function in 2007 and are for children from 0 to 3 years
of age. They are managed by the Government of Galicia (La Xunta de Galicia) and
numerous urban and rural councils, and are located in small municipalities and in cities.
This educational project seeks to provide a quality educational offer in the Galician
474

language to children of this age.

Sub-paragraph

b, i): provide a guaranteed primary school education in the

corresponding regional or minority languages; or

As detailed above, during the 2007/2008 course, Decree 124/2007 of 28 June became
applicable, through which the use and the promotion of Galician in the educational system
was regulated. This same decree establishes that Galician will be the language used in at
least 50% of all teaching. Furthermore, Galician is obligatory in the areas of Mathematics,
Knowledge of the Natural, Social and Cultural Environment and Education for the Public
and Human Rights.

Sub-paragraph

c, i): to provide a guaranteed secondary school education in the

corresponding regional or minority languages;

For secondary compulsory education (from 12 to 16 years of age), Decree 124/2007
establishes that Galician will be the language used in at least 50% of all teaching, although
the decision for the choice of subjects in the attainment of this percentage is the decision
of the faculty. In any event, Galician is compulsory in the areas of Mathematics, Education
for Citizenship, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences.

With respect to the post-compulsory secondary education (Pre-university course: 16-18
years of age), Galician is the language used in at least 50% of all teaching. Decree
124/2007 does not explicitly detail the subjects which have to be taught in Galician,
although it does establish that the decision in the choosing of these subjects, in order to
reach a figure of at least 50% of all teaching, corresponds to the teaching faculty.

Sub-paragraph d, i): provide a guaranteed technical and professional education in the
corresponding regional or minority languages;

In the so-called training cycles, Galician is also the language used in at least 50% of all
teaching and the teaching faculty is responsible for choosing the subjects to attain this
percentage. Not withstanding the above, it is however compulsory to use Galician in the
speciality modules.

475

Sub-paragraph e, iii): if, due to the role of the state, with respect to higher education
centres, sections i) and ii) cannot be applied, the promotion and/or authorisation of the
establishment of university education or other forms of higher education in the regional or
minority languages or of means which allow these languages to be studied at university or
in other higher education centres will be undertaken;

There are three public universities in Galicia, each one of which has an area dedicated to
the standardisation of the Galician language. These services possess a permanent
structure with specialised staff. The incorporation of the Galician language in the teaching
procedures of the three Galician universities is progressive and still far-removed when
contrasted with the proportion of education given in Spanish.

In these three universities, the language of statutory use is Galician, however it is used
more by non-teaching staff than by teaching staff. In broad terms, the reality which existing
studies reflect is that of low use in both teaching and in investigation.

As positive elements, the high linguistic competence of students must be noted, and above
all, the awareness of the university community with respect to the need to foster the use of
the Galician language.

As such, the services of linguistic standardisation of each one of the universities undertake
(among others) the following functions: linguistic dynamisation, the correction of texts, the
linguistic assessment of staff from the various administrative units, the solution of doubts
and orientation with respect to terminology, the correction of teaching material, notes,
articles, etc., or teaching in Galician of the university community. The three standardisation
services, also implemented programmes for promoting the use of Galician in distinct
university areas. During the 2006-2008 period in the three universities, awards for
subsidies were published for investigation in Galician, services of linguistic assessment
were offered, teaching provisions in Galician were increased, terminological vocabulary
was created and language fostering campaigns were undertaken, as were multi-linguistic
promotion programmes in teaching at the

University of Vigo, the campaign “Para, contra

a violencia, recuperarmos a lingua” of the University of A Coruña, or the awards for quality
and linguistic excellence of the University of Santiago.
476

As a new item of interest, the Governing Council of the University of A Coruña, in its
meeting of 14 December 2006, approved the Plan on Linguistic Standardisation with no
votes against it. In order to enact its effective implementation it created a monitoring
commission which, in the meeting of 15 October 2007, approved the package of measures
which corresponded to the 2007-2008 academic course. With this plan of standardisation,
the University of A Coruña was added to those courses approved by the University of
Santiago in 2001 and by the University of Vigo, in 2004.

Sub-paragraph f, i): make provisions so that courses for adult education or continual
education are undertaken mainly or totally in the regional or minority languages;

In 2007 a system of Galician language certification adapted to the Common European
Framework of Reference for Languages was implanted. This was set up through distinct
language levels and compiles the abilities reflected by communicative ability in distinct
skills and groups together the following contents: language and communication:
communicative functions; language and system: the understanding of code and language,
culture and society and sociocultural contents.
Five levels of certification were established in an order which ranged from lesser to greater
levels of difficulty. These certifications sought to certify a knowledge of Galician to the
effects of requirements or professional and academic merits. Access to certificates is
undertaken by means of tests. Two options are offered for the preparation of these tests:
either by attending a preparatory course for the certification level chosen, which are held
periodically, or by self-learning means, taking the chosen Galician Language Certification
Programme (CELGA) into consideration. The following table details the number of
preparatory courses which took place in 2007 and 2008.

The teaching courses for teaching staff and the courses for evaluators seek to:
•

Provide those attending with the tools necessary for planning and the evaluation in the
education and learning process of the Galician language, within a communicative and
constructive focus, allowing the presence of a diversity of activities and opportunities
for learning in the classes which are aimed at developing the communicative abilities of
students.

•

Respond to the demands of the context of teaching, learning and the evaluation of
Galician required by today's society.

•

Reflect on teaching tasks themselves, as an element to dynamise the training of
Galician language teaching staff.

•

Contribute to the understanding of the functional and formal system of Galician and
provide students with a suitable didactic treatment with communicative principles for
the teaching of languages.

According to data available, in 2008, a total of 184,677 people registered for the tests for
one of the first four levels of Galician language certificates.

General

Secretariat

for

Linguistic

Policy

(www.xunta.es/linguagalega/formacion_de_adultos) offers specific materials for the
preparation of each level, in addition to examination models for those candidates who wish
to study at home. Two exams are held every year. These courses are offered in Galicia
and abroad, through the international network of Galician centres, as well as in universities
in Europe and America with Galician Study Centres.

The General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy is the body responsible for the administration
and design of adult education in the Galician language, which it undertakes through the
above-mentioned preparatory courses for attaining the CELGA and through other training
courses in Galician, such as specific language courses, courses of cultural extension or
courses for the training of teaching staff and specialists in the Galician language.

478

Sub-paragraph g: take measures to ensure the teaching of the history and culture which
the regional or minority language is an expression of;

The history and culture of Galicia are study subjects at distinct pre-university levels
through subjects such as Galician Language and Literature or the Social Sciences.
Furthermore, public bodies exist, such as the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the
Galician Government, which has, among its main objectives, that of fostering the study,
the divulgation and the teaching of the history and culture of Galicia. There are also
various associations, foundations and private entities in Galicia, whose fundamental task is
cultural promotion.

Sub-paragraph

h: guarantee the initial and continual training of the teaching staff

necessary for the application of paragraphs a) to g) which the party has accepted;

Galicia has also set up the so-called Training and Resource Centres which depend on the
Ministry of Education and University Organisation of the Galician Government. In the
seven centres in Galicia, the annual training plans for infant, primary school and secondary
school teaching staff take place, which include specific courses and cross-subject content
related to the history and culture of Galicia.

Since the application of Decree 124/2007, those teaching staff in the teaching degree
course are obliged to attend a linguistic training course which deals with contents of a
sociolinguistic nature, on language didactics, etc.

In 2007 a Galician language certification system was set up in Galicia which is adapted to
the Common European Language Reference Framework (CELGA) which was established
through various distinct language levels and which covers the abilities reflected in
communicative ability in different skills areas, bringing together the contents of language
and communication; communicative functions

and language

and

systems;

the

understanding of code and language, culture and society, with sociocultural contents.

Furthermore, with respect to the training of teaching staff for CELGA preparatory courses,
9 training courses for teaching staff were held in 2007 and 2008. During the same years,
another 9 courses for the training of CELGA courses were also held.

479

Sub-paragraph i: create one or several control bodies responsible with the monitoring of
the adopted measures and of the progress made in the establishment or development of
the teaching of the regional or minority languages and to write periodical reports which will
be made public.
paragraph 2: With respect to education and to territories distinct from those in which the
regional or minority languages are traditionally spoken, the parties agree to authorise,
foster or establish, if the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies it,
the teaching of the regional or minority language or in the language at levels which are
considered appropriate.

The Autonomous Statute of Castilla y León (Organic Law 4/1983, reformed by Organic
Law 14/2007) establishes in Article 5.3 that “the Galician language will enjoy respect and
protection in those places where it is habitually used”. Under this law, since the 2001-2002
academic year, the teaching programme has been undertaken in Galician in various
centres in El Bierzo in the towns of El Bierzo and Sanabria, so that those students who
wish, may learn Galician.

On 30 August 2006, the General Protocol of Cooperation was signed in Ponferrada
between the Government of Galicia and the Community of Castilla y

León for the

promotion of the Galician language in the border territories of the autonomous
communities (El Bierzo and Sanabria) which provided continuity to the above-mentioned
programme. The programme itself comprised, in primary education, the possibility of
studying the subjects “Knowledge of the Environment” or “Artistic Education” in Galician,
once a week, following the same contents as those students who only study in Spanish.
As such, in secondary education, the possibility was also offered to study the subject of
Social Sciences in Galician during the entire compulsory secondary education course
(ESO), also with the same contents as those students who studied in Spanish. Optional
subjects also exist for Galician Language and Culture in the 4th ESO course and in the
first and second years of Bachillerate (pre-university) courses. Students who follow all the
courses in the Galician educational programme, on both primary and ESO levels will have
480

the right to be awarded a CELGA Level 2 certificate. In the same manner CELGA Level 3
is awarded to those students who attend the two Bachillerate (pre-university) courses
offered.

The following table details the centres in which the offer described exists, in addition to the
number of students registered for these courses:

The Application of Article 9.

Paragraph 1. The parties agree to, with respect to that which refers to the divisions of the
judicial authorities in which the number of persons who reside in them, and who speak the
regional or minority languages, justifies the following specific measures, according to the
situation of each one of these languages and on condition that the court does not consider
that the use of the possibilities offered in this paragraph constitutes an obstacle for the
proper administration of justice:

a) in penal procedures:
Sub-paragraph a.i): ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties, undertake the procedure in the regional or minority languages; and/or
Sub-paragraph a, ii): guarantee the accused the right to express him/her self in his / her
regional or minority language; and/or
Sub-paragraph a, iii): ensure that the claims and the proof, either written or oral are not
considered negligible for the sole motive that they are written in a regional or minority
language; and/or

Sub-paragraph a, iv): draw up in the aforementioned regional or minority languages, on
request, the documents pertaining to a judicial procedure, recurring, where necessary to
interpreters and translations without additional expenses for the interested parties;

b) in civil procedures:

Sub-paragraph b, i): ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties, undertake procedures in the regional or minority languages; and/or

Sub-paragraph b, ii): permit, when a party in a legal dispute has to appear in person
before a court, that he /she may express him /her self in his /her regional or minority
language without having to incur additional expenses in doing so; and/or

Sub-paragraph b, iii): permit the presentation of documents and proof in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary using the services of interpreters and translations.
482

c) in procedures before courts with jurisdiction in administrative matters

Sub-paragraph c, i): ensure that the jurisdictional bodies, on the request of one of the
parties undertake procedures in the regional or minority languages; and/or

Sub-paragraph c, ii): permit, when a party in a legal dispute has to appear in person
before a court, that he /she may express him /her self in his /her regional or minority
language without having to incur additional expenses in doing so; and/or

Sub-paragraph c, iii): permit the presentation of documents and proof in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary using the services of interpreters and translations;
Sub-paragraph

d: adopt measures so that the application of sections i) and

iii) of

paragraphs b) and c) above and the use, where applicable of interpreters and translations,
do not incur additional expenses for the interested parties.

Paragraph 2: The parties agree to:

Sub-paragraph a: Not reject the validity of legal documents drawn up within the state
area for the sole reason that they have been drafted in a regional or minority language;

párrafo 3: The parties agree to make accessible the most important national legislative
texts and especially those which refer to the speakers of the above-mentioned languages,
unless the these texts are already available in another form.

The Organic Law on Judicial Power (LOPJ) establishes in Article 231, the following
prescriptions which are the subject to comments on this subject:
“1. In all judicial actions, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, secretaries and other civil
servants of courts and tribunals will use Spanish, the official language of the state”.

“2. The judges, magistrates, prosecutors, secretaries and other civil servants of courts and
483

tribunals will also be able to use the official language of the autonomous communities, if
none of the parties opposes this, alleging an incapacity to understand the language, which
may result in an inability for proper defence”.

With respect to the above, it is deduced that the use of Galician by these public civil
servants is optional, although its use is conditioned by the fact that one of the parties does
not oppose it, alleging a lack of proper defence resulting from an incapacity to understand
the language. In this case the civil servant may choose to renounce the use of Galician or
offer the translation of his/her actions for those interested parties who may request this.

“3. The parties, their representatives and those who direct them, in addition to witnesses
and experts will be able to use the language which may also be official in the autonomous
communities in whose area judicial actions take place, both in oral and written
declarations”.

This point introduces the possibility for all participants in the process (parties, prosecutors,
lawyers, witnesses and experts) to choose any of the languages which are official in an
autonomous community.

“4. The judicial actions undertaken and the documents presented in the official language of
an autonomous community will have, without the need for translation into Spanish, total
validity and efficacy. Officially, the documents will be translated, when they take effect
outside of the jurisdiction of the judicial bodies in the autonomous community, unless
autonomous communities with an official language which coincides are involved.
Translations will also be made when this is established by the law or at the request of the
party alleging inability to proper defence”.

This rule underlines the total validity and efficacy of the documents written in Galician and
presented before the jurisdictional organisations. The use of Galician is also possible in
the different levels of the judicial process in which a dispute may develop, provided that
the sentence of the court of appeal has been dictated by a body which is located in this
autonomous community.

“5. In oral proceedings, the judge or court may use as an interpreter, any person who
speaks the language used, after the person employed as such has taken an oath”.
484

It must be underlined that the judicial body is responsible for facilitating the translation, the
interested party cannot be held responsible for this task.

The General Directorate of Justice of the Galician Government is the body which is
responsible for promoting the use of Galician in the Department of Justice, in cooperation
with the General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy.

The modification of the Organic Law of Judicial Power (LOPJ), undertaken by Organic Law
19/2003 of 23 December, introduces Article

450.4, which establishes that, in those

autonomous communities with a language different from Spanish, its understanding will be
evaluated as a merit for the provision of positions for legal secretaries, a provision which
continues that already introduced in Article 341 of the LOPJ for both the positions of court
president as well as other posts, such as magistrates and judges posted in autonomous
communities with their own language. This reform, which was undertaken by the LOPJ
19/2003 introduces the list of positions, with respect to legal secretaries and civil servants
at the service of the Department of Justice (forensic scientists, administrators, servicers
and auxiliary staff) as an instrument for the organisation of professional activities. This
measure allows the establishment of unique positions for which specific requirements can
be made. With respect to this, Article 530 of the LOPJ now establishes that in determined
work positions in the autonomous communities with an official language of their own, oral
and written knowledge may be considered as a requirement for access to these positions.
With respect to requirements, the law demands that this demand derives from the nature
of the functions to be undertaken in these positions and that as such, it is to be established
in the list of work positions.

In terms of application with respect to autonomous communities, Law 3/1983 of 15 June,
on Linguistic Standardisation, (LNL) establishes in Article 7.1 that in the territorial area of
Galicia, the public may use any of the two official languages in their relations with the
Department of Justice. This stipulation specifies that established in Point 3 of Article 231 of
the LOPJ for the autonomous community of Galicia.

Article 7.2 of the LNL establishes, following Paragraph 2 of Article 231 of the LOPJ, that
“judicial actions in Galicia will be valid and will be effective, whatever the official language
used. In all events, the party interested will have the right to be communicated or notified
in the official language he/she chooses”. In the same manner, Law 3/1983 encharges the
485

Government of Galicia with the promotion, in accordance with the corresponding bodies, of
the progressive standardisation of the use of Galician in the Department of Justice.

During the 2006-2008 period, the Government of Galicia undertook various initiatives
aimed at developing the recommendations established in the Plan Xeral de Normalización
da Lingua Galega (PXNLG) under the denominations of “positive offer" and "informative
offer". The term positive offer is defined as the “adoption of Galician as the language of
initial contact between the person representing the administration and the public”; while an
informative offer is the act of “reporting on the validity and legality of writing a document in
-

Galician”. Some initiatives in this framework consisted in:
The re-publication of the text of the PXNLG, which was distributed on a large scale
-

among the distinct departments of the administration.
The inclusion in the agreements signed by the General Secretariat of Linguistic
Policy with public and private bodies of clauses which obliged these entities to follow
positive offer practices in their daily activity and especially in those activities which are
-

the subject of the agreement.
The inclusion in the E logo! Campaign for the promotion of the use of Galician of
material for this purpose. An example of which is the distribution among staff of local
and autonomous administration bodies, of a calendar during 2007 and 2008 in which
-

the definitions of the terms positive offer and informative offer were given.
The signing of a participatory agreement with the Notary College of Galicia, which
aims to improve linguistic education in Galician for all those persons involved in notarybased activities, and in this manner introduce the positive offer of serving the public in
Galician among notaries working in Galicia, in addition to introducing the concepts of
positive and informative offers into the practices of notary-based activities. By way of
example of the activities carried out in participation with the Notary College of Galicia to
this end, it must be underlined that in 2007 a campaign was undertaken which
consisted in the placement of a poster with information on the linguistic rights of the
public in the waiting rooms of notary offices, with the express indication that documents
drafted and signed may be provided at the same cost and with the same legal value in
Galician. This campaign was based on the fact that the incorporation of Galician in
normal activities with respect to private transactions is slow (purchases, sales,
-

mortgages and wills).
Aware that the positive offer will only be effective and possible if public civil servants
486

possess sufficient linguistic competence with which to apply it, a special effort was
made with respect to training. As such, specific programmes of an educational nature
were developed for civil servants in the Department of Justice (magistrates, judges,
prosecutors and secretaries), at an autonomous and local level.

Furthermore, the Irmandade Xurídica Galega was formed, this organisation comprises
more than thirty lawyers and civil servants who seek to promote the use of the Galician
language in the Department of Justice.

With respect to linguistic competence levels required in the processes of access to work
positions, the General Directorate of Justice, in all the singular posts defined for the new
list of work positions (RPT) establishes, as a requirement for access, the knowledge of the
Galician language. At a general level the course of legal language is required at an
average level and occasionally at an advanced level.

In Galicia some 2,300 civil servants are staff in the service of the Department of Justice
(forensic scientists, managers, processors and auxiliary staff) which depends organically
on the Government of Galicia, however these civil servants belong to national bodies and
the regulation of their legal statute corresponds to the state via the Ministry of Justice.

The state, in the development of the LOPJ, approved Royal Decree 1451/2005 of 7
December through which the the Regulation of Income, the Provision of Workplaces and
Professional Promotion for Civil Service Staff in the Service of the Department of Justice.
In Article 48.1.b it established as a criteria for the award of positions, in both contests of
transfer and of merit, “the oral and written knowledge of the official language of the
autonomous community”. Galician, according to the level of knowledge accredited, will be
evaluated to a maximum of 12 points (equivalent to 6 years of service). The evaluation
criteria of the profiles and linguistic levels refer to the base structures of the award rules.

Article 49.4 of this regulation (which stipulates the same rule as in the LOPJ) refers to the
establishment of the linguistic domain as an access requirement for individualised posts.

Article 25 of the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia establishes that, in the resolution for
contests and professional exams for the posts of magistrates, judges, legal secretaries,
prosecutors and all civil servants in the service of the Department of Justice a preferential
487

criteria is knowledge of the language of the country. The same provision is contained in
Article 26 of the Statute with respect to notaries and property and commercial registrars.

With respect to this point, Law 3/1983, on Linguistic Standardisation, in Article 11.3,
reproduces the aforementioned provisions of the Statute of Autonomy. The General Plan
for the Standardisation of the Galician Language establishes that it is necessary to obtain
the linguistic qualification of all those persons who work in the Department of Justice as a
means to guarantee the exercise of linguistic rights by the public.

With respect to judiciary careers, the regulatory framework considered in this report is still
applicable (Article 341 of the LOPJ and articles 108, 109 and 114 of Regulation CGPJ nº
1/1995 on judicial careers as redacted in Agreement CGPJ of the 25.02.1998).

Although the Organic Statute of the Public Prosecution Service has still not been modified
to the aforementioned provisions of Article 25 of the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia, Royal
Decree 1/2008 of 11 January however considers the understanding of the Galician
language as a criteria in applications for the position of substitute prosecutor.

With respect to legal secretaries, in addition to that noted previously, that established in
Article 109 1.b), 109.3 and 109.5 of the Organic Regulation on the Body of Legal
Secretaries which was approved by Royal Decree 1608/2005 of 30 December must be
noted.

This regulation establishes the concession of a score equivalent to three years of service
according to the level of understanding verified as a criteria for access to competitive
professional exams and criteria for transfers for the posts of legal secretaries in Galicia. As
such, the Resolution of 16 May 2006 of the General Directorate of Relations with the
Department of Justice through which the level and score points are established for work
placement contests for substitute secretaries, considers the understanding of Galician as a
merit in this autonomous community (BOE of 02.06.2006).

The operation of the Linguistic Assessment Offices of the Department of Justice should
also

be

underlined,

where

5

linguists

(with

university

degrees)

and

9

translators/interpreters with work positions in A Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Lugo,
Ourense, Pontevedra and Vigo currently undertake the tasks of:
488

a)

the correction of texts and linguistic assessment for judges, prosecutors,

secretaries and other civil servants;
b)

the translation of documents, sentences, orders, resolutions and other judicial

actions (from Galician into Spanish and from Spanish into Galician);
c)

interpreters for oral declarations and statements in trials and hearings;

d)

the issuing of reports on Galician onomastics;

e)

the translation of laws, regulations, circulars and norms relating to the area of the

Department of Justice;
f)

the creation of collections of documents in Galician which are parallel to those

collections available in the I.T. Applications of the Department of Justice.

Furthermore, the Government of Galicia, through the Ministry of the Presidency, began the
implantation of the MINERVA I.T. Application, which is included in the Programme of New
Technology for Justice. This application, which involved a parallel planning of language
promotion, involves the complete renewal of the I.T. Platform of the courts, it includes
procedure models and may be set up to undertake a guided procedure. It was effectively
implanted in the mixed courts and in the administrative-litigation and social courts in the
cities of Lugo, Ourense and A Coruña, and the process will continue with its implantation
in the administrative-litigation and social courts courts in the cities of Santiago and
Pontevedra and later in Vigo and Ferrol. This calendar was accompanied by the
corresponding training courses for users of the application. In all events it must be noted
that the version in Galician is not the complete version. This is verified by the fact that
although the Spanish version comprises some 8,000 documents, the Galician version
contains less than 3,000. However the incorporation of collections of documents in I.T.
applications is facilitating procedures in Galician.

With respect to the above, and given that one of the objectives of the General Plan for the
Standardisation of the Galician Language is that of translating administrative I.T
programmes and forms for daily use into Galician, while guaranteeing the presence of
Galician in all the judicial bodies of Galicia, the General Directorate of Justice, which has
powers assigned to it in the area of the execution of the plan for the computerising of the
judicial system of Galicia, in addition to that relating to the design, programming and
maintenance of the I.T. Applications in those bodies based in the autonomous community,
489

these organisations possess the LIBRA computer programme for administration
procedures, which to date is being used in two versions, Libra 6 and Libra 8.

With respect to public registries, Galician Law 3/1983, on Linguistic Standardisation,
specifies the following in Article 9:

1. In those public registries which depend on the autonomous government, entries will
be made in the official language in which the document is written or the declaration
made. If the document is bilingual, it will be written in the language chosen by the
person presenting the document in the registry.
2. Written certificates will be issued in the language in which the written copy was
made.
3. Certificates of those documents registered in a dual linguistic version may be
obtained

in

either version, according to the desires of the applicant.

In the case of civil registries, Law 12/2005 of 22 July modified Article 23 of the Law of the
Civil Registry, establishing the following:

“The entries will be made in Spanish or in the official language of the autonomous
community where the civil registry is located, in accordance with the language in which the
document is drafted or in which the declaration has been made. If the document is
bilingual, entries will be made in the language chosen by the person presenting it at the
registry. This, provided that the linguistic legislation of the autonomous community
establishes the possibility of the drafting of public entries in a co-official language different
from Spanish”.

The provision referred to, which has involved the adaptation of the state regulation to the
autonomous laws, with respect to linguistic standardisation, has meant that at present, all
the entries in civil registries in those autonomous communities with a co-official language
are drafted in the language in which the document is written or in the language used by the
person appearing in his/her declaration or that which he/she chooses if the document is
bilingual.

Furthermore, as part of the promotion for the computerisation of the civil registries and in
490

order to facilitate the use of the different official languages when making registry entries,
the Ministry of Justice has undertaken the necessary amendments in INFOREG - the
application system for the registration of inscriptions in civil registries. As such, Order JUS
1468/2007 of 17 May on the Promotion for the Computerisation of the Civil Registries and
the Digitalisation of its Archives, approved Version 4.0 of this application, establishing that,
in order to allow the fulfilment of that established in the final paragraph of Article 23 of the
Civil Registry Law, that facilitation must be provided so that entries may be made in the
official language of the autonomous community where the civil registry is located.

At present almost all the civil registries have been computerised, including those of
Galicia, and the multi-lingual version of the aforementioned INFOREG application has
been implanted in all registries.

Furthermore, the names of individuals in any of the official languages of the state,
including Galician, has been possible, since 1977, when Law 17/1977 of 4 January was
enacted on the reform in this area of Article 54 of the Law of Civil Registries.

With respect to property and commercial registries, a state reform of adaptation to the
autonomous norms of linguistic standardisation is pending and being studied, although it
must be noted that, in the area of the three registries mentioned (civil, property and
commercial), formal notifications (certifications and notes), i.e. that which implies an
externalisation of the entries with respect to third parties and which therefore directly
affects the exercise of the linguistic rights of the public, may be undertaken in any of the
official languages, according to the request which may be made in this respect by the
public.

With regard to the adaptation of notaries to the principles of the charter, registrars and
notaries are among the recipients of the offer of Galician legal language courses; in 2007,
a training programme was implanted for the employees of notaries. The College of
Notaries of Galicia also participated with the General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy in the
creation of specific measures as part of a general promotion campaign for the use of
Galician throughout society for the promotion of Galician in the Department of Justice and
especially in notaries, as a fully valid and efficient language for the drafting of any type of
documents. Among the activities undertaken was that of promoting the display of a poster
in all notaries in Galicia which provided information on the fact that documents may be
491

drafted in Galician in order to create a social demand for documentary

services in

Galician.

It must finally be recognised that in private transactions (purchases, sales, mortgages,
wills) that Galician has been incorporated slowly in notary activities, a fact partly promoted
by associative bodies and also by the decision of some notaries, who make entries in
documents presented in Galician.

The Application of Article 10.

page of the insurance company. The usual number of printed copies for this type of
publication is 900, in Spanish and 5,000 in Galician.

The insurance company magazine is currently undergoing a process of redefinition, which
will involve a significant reduction of the number of printed copies, while supporting the
digital version. For 2010, copies in all the co-official languages are included in the
publications plan. Examples of those subjects envisaged (in both paper and online format)
are:
• A diptych of the charter of electronic services (60,000 in Spanish and 5,000 in Galician)

respect to State Law 29/2005 of 29 December on advertising and institutional
communication.

The subdelegation of the government in Pontevedra has undertaken 2 publicity campaigns
in bilingual format.

The General Insurance Company of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) publishes printed
institutional material related to publicity campaigns in the co-official languages.
•

Level of accessibility of web pages in the co-official language.

The pages of the 060.es (www.060.es) web page on general information regarding
administrative services are available in the distinct co-official languages. The website has
its home page, the secondary pages and all the elements required for searching (title
menus, menus for secondary pages, left and right menus) in the co-official languages. The
new 060 website will have the same structure and the progressive translation of contents
into the co-official languages and English is planned.

On the www.la-moncloa.es web page the static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles)
are all translated, as is information of a permanent character.

In the www.mpr.es web page the static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles) are all
translated into the co-official languages, as is information of a permanent character, to the
first level of web navigation, in accord with that established by the guide for the editing and
publication of the web pages of the General Department of the State, which establishes as
a general criteria, the translation of static documents, general information and those
documents which require little modification and/or updating.

The State Agency for the Evaluation of Public Policies and the Quality of Services
(AEVAL) has a total level of accessibility, meaning that a duplicate website exists for each
one of the co-official languages, with an independent home page. With respect to content:
495

- The static elements (menus, sub-menus and titles) are all translated. Those sections
relating to institutional information of a theoretical or doctrinal character regarding
matters pertaining to agency activities are translated to the final level of website
navigation: 40% of all pages.
- Mixed translation (the first level in the co-official language and the following levels in
Spanish) in documents which occasionally have variable sections (quality permit, annual
evaluations, etc.): 30% of all pages.
- Not translated into the co-official languages are all those pages relating to the news,
events or adverts, or which are continually updated. 30% of all pages.

In the Official State Gazette (BOE): All the web pages of the boe.es (static and
organisational content) are translated into the co-official languages. A total of 26,610
pages of BOE supplements have been published in Galician (from 1998 to 2009)

The Centre of Policy and Constitutional Studies (CEPC) is in the process of adapting their
web page through the translation into the co-official languages of static and organisational
elements in addition to those of other contents of interest.

The web page of the Centre of Sociological Investigation (CIS) (research and statistics
statistics) are translated into the co-official languages:
• All web pages in HTML
• The non-validated online request forms which need to be printed and sent.
• The form for downloading micro-data.
As far as the the web page of the National Institute of Public Administration Bodies is
concerned, and given that the information facilitated is applicable for a brief period, due to
its rapid creation, and that the translations are undertaken by contracted specialist
companies into those official languages different from Spanish and into English, the
contents gathered in the languages distinct from Spanish must be limited to those
permanent informative elements of the web page (the names of the distinct web channels)
and to the headings on the home page.

The General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants is currently in the process of
496

changing its web page. The new page is planned to be operational shortly. The current
circumstances and those of the forthcoming website are described below.

1) The Current Website

The overall translation level of the static website (excluding electronic services under the
generic name of "General Insurance Company of the State Civil Servants-Direct") is
approximately 55 to 60 percent. This means that the first and second level of navigation
are practically 100 percent translated, however after the third level the text is in Spanish
only. The institutional information has been almost completely translated (approximately
97 percent). With respect to downloadable printed documents, the translation level is
approximately 95 percent.

The electronic services (General Insurance Company of the State Civil Servants-Direct),
are not translated and are only available in Spanish.

2) New web page (this page will be in operation in 2010)
2.1) 80 percent of the static website will be translated.
2.2) Electronic services will be in Spanish alone. Coverage in the remaining co-official
languages will be completed during 2010.

With respect to the National Heritage organisation, the following contents of its web page
have been translated into the co-official languages:

- Language selection menu
- Upper menu with the main areas of the website
- Complementary menu (website map, contacts, etc.)
•

Requests received and answered in co-official languages.

The National Institute of Public Administration (INAP), which although has not received
requests in the co-official languages, is willing to proceed, when relevant, to answer these
requests in the co-official language used in the requests.

497

Requests for information received in a co-official language in the central services of the
General Insurance Group of State Civil Servants are answered in Spanish. The proportion
of requests in Galician is approximately 26% (220 of 850 files) with significant differences
between the provincial services of A Coruña (32.8%, 82/250), Lugo (6.5% 13/200)
Pontevedra (6% 9/150) and Ourense (2.4% 6/250).

In the delegation and subdelegations of the government, although not many requests are
received in the co-official language, all those presented in this language are answered in
the same fashion.
•

Staff with an Understanding of the Official Languages and their Level of
Understanding.

It may be affirmed that almost 100% of the staff in all the services of the general
administration of the state in the community is able to attend to the public in Galician. This
highly favourable situation has resulted as a consequence of the training efforts made (325
courses and 7,872 attendants from 1995), and also due to the origins of a large part of the
group.

With respect to the use of Galician in written expression, newly-incorporated civil servants
provide an optimum situation due to the education they received in Galician in primary and
secondary education, while the rest of the staff improve their abilities by taking part in
training initiatives. Due to this, it may be considered that in Galicia, problems in distinct
units do not exist with respect to answering current demands for procedures to be
undertaken in Galician.

Furthermore, included among the activities promoted by the National Institute of Public
Administration (INAP) as part of the Continual Training Programme for Public Employees
is the teaching of co-official languages, including Galician, to civil servants of the General
Administration of the State who are posted to autonomous communities with a co-official
language.

In the case of Galicia, activities are regulated through specific participatory agreements
which are signed each year, and which have been signed since the year 2000 by INAP
and the Galician School of Public Administration in the development of the Framework
498

Agreement of 4 July 1998 with the participation of the Delegation of the Government in
Galicia in the programming of courses and the selection of students.

this programme allows users to ask questions and make requests using the Internet.
Responses are provided by professional librarians via e-mail within a three-day period.
513

The consultations and requests for information may be made in any of the co-official
languages of the state and the responses to these requests are provided in the language
of the requests.

In addition, the websites for the digital library projects promoted and undertaken by the
Ministry of Culture are translated into all the co-official languages in the Spanish state. As
such, in the Virtual Library of Bibliographic Heritage, access is allowed to information
through the use of multilingual headings which contain both content descriptions and the
names of authors or institutions in the different languages of the state.

Among the services offered by the Ministry of Culture for public libraries is the Generator
of Websites for Libraries, a tool designed for librarians which allows them to create the
websites of their libraries without any kind of linguistic limitation. To this end the libraries of
those autonomous communities with two official languages offer their contents in both
languages.
With respect to the area of the scenic arts and music, in those sections which correspond
to the web page of the ministry and in those of artistic creation centres, access is possible
to directories in the four co-official languages. Furthermore, in the new web pages of the
numerous creation centres of the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music, information
will be presented in the co-official languages of the state.
In 2009 the web pages of those museums administered by the Ministry of Culture began to
include the co-official languages of the autonomous communities. The index and the static
content of the National Museum of Subaquatic Archaeology (ARQUA) were translated in
2009. The web pages of the National College Museum of San Gregorio of Valladolid and
the National Museum of Romanticism of Madrid will soon be adapted. The aim is to
include the above-mentioned languages as the web pages of the other museums are
updated.
With respect to the National Museum of El Prado, the visitor channel which is available on
its web page is translated into the co-official languages with the following contents:
Opening Hours and Fees, Services and Recommendations, Accesses and Maps.
514

Furthermore the channel 15 Masterpieces is translated into these languages, with the
contents from a selection of 15 works in the museum, with technical data and explanatory
texts.
The access level of the website in the co-official languages of the Museo Nacional Centro
de Arte Reina Sofía is 44.5%. Of the nine sections which comprise the structure of the
museum's website

(www.museoreinasofia.es), four (Visits, Museum, Collection and

Library) are offered to users in the co-official languages of the state.
The National Library of Spain undertook a project to remodel its institutional website in
May 2009. This new website has been designed as a single multi-language website where
users can select their navigation language; this means that the web page structure is
identical in every language – so as to display all the contents in the official language of
Spain (Spanish) as well as in the co-official languages.

Besides, the National Library implemented a system of integrated translation on its website
and will initiate a follow-up process for all those works pending translation.
The National Library also has a channel on Youtube in which all its videos are transcribed
into the different co-official languages of the state.

Level of accessibility of web pages in the co-official language.

The Ministry Web Page

The ministry web page (http://www.mpt.es) is available in the co-official languages, and a
large part of its content is available in them. Over the last few years a large effort has been
made in the revision and translation of contents.

Given the large volume of information available of the web page of the Ministry of
Territorial Policy, the decision was made to adapt the web with respect to navigation
levels, beginning with the upper levels, as these are the most visible.

The contents of the web page have now been translated, at least to the fourth level of
browsing, and even more in some of its sections. For the moment the news features are
not translated due to the urgency involved in their publication, as they would lost relevance
given the delay involved in translation. The translation of news items has not been seen as
necessary at later moments, as interest for this information decreases with time.

It has been estimated that there are now more than 300 translated pages available.
Statistics for access to http://www.mpt.es for 2009 in the distinct co-official languages are
given below:

Web access in co-official languages

Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May,Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
Months
Web pages in Catalan – Web pages in Basque – Web pages in Galician

The publishers of content have an infrastructure at their disposal which allows the
introduction of translations through a user-friendly interface which provides them with
translations of the texts they request for inclusion on the website.

Among the improvements programmed in the publishing environment, and which are to be
approached in the near future, is the project for the introduction of a translation workflow
which facilitates the process of obtaining translations and which in turn, will lead to the
greater involvement of publishers in the inclusion of translated texts.

This media has also been used (http://www.mpt.es) to place notification signs for
construction projects in the co-official languages at the disposal of those councils which
are beneficiaries of the State Fund for Local Investment, as can be seen at
http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html. These signs have
been re-used for the State Fund, for Employment and Local Sustainability.

In the setting up of the ministry's electronic site, the need for translated contents is being
taken into consideration. As such, “Acceda” (Access), the application used as a basis for
the site, has been adapted to allow the translation of the forms used by the public in the
electronic processing of procedures, and it will also allow the inclusion of various contents
which have been translated into the co-official languages, in addition to others, such as
English and French.

The Intranet of the Ministry of Territorial Policy

In the working environment of ministry staff, the linguistic diversity of the Spanish state has
517

also been considered. In this manner, the Intranet of the ministry (http://intranet.mpt.es)
was designed with this criteria in mind, such that it has versions of pages in the co-official
languages and it is prepared for the inclusion of translated contents on these pages.
•

The Internet site of the Tax Office enables effective communication in the co-official
language of the user's choice. As such, the website of the Tax Office appears in
Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Valencian and provides definitive information in
Basque.

Given the volume of information to be translated, the incorporation of translated
material onto these pages is gradual. As such users are provided contents in
Catalan, Galician, Valencian and those which are not yet available in the abovementioned languages are in Spanish. The Tax Office is however committed to
continue its improvements in this sense. In all events it has been guaranteed that
tax payers may use the co-official language of their autonomous community.

The translated contents cover all levels of navigation except news, due to the
immediate nature of its content and other exceptions, due to technical reasons or
due to the time needed for translation, above all in the case of PDF documents.
With respect to the translation of normative provisions, only those translated into the
corresponding co-official language are published in the official newspapers.

The Level of Accessibility of Web Pages in the Co-official Language indicating
Contents

The general framework of action in which the administrative activity of the department
takes place does not normally involve the use of co-official or minority languages, except
in relations of information through the web page and public information points in the central
offices of the ministry, where communication with the public does not often involve direct
contact and communication is, in the immense majority of cases, undertaken via telephone
or e-mail.

In 2008 the request for information relating to different department areas exceeded
450,000 demands and these were attended in the language chosen by the person making
the request. As there are no statistics on the distribution of the languages used by those
requesting information, it may be stated that the use of Spanish was in the majority.

The visits to the department web page; hppt://www.marm.es, which has information in all
the co-official languages of Spain were mostly in Spanish during 2008. 97% of web page
visits were made using Spanish, some 60 million during the year. The most used official
language was Catalan, with 0.55%, followed by Galician, with 0.36%.

The ministry web page also offers information in the co-official languages in a static form;
a legislative data base exists in which the regulations of certain autonomous communities
may be consulted in their official language.

A new web page is currently being designed which integrates the contents of the areas of
the environment and the rural and marine areas in a more harmonised manner, and which
has a new system which will improve the adaptation of the website to the use of the coofficial languages.

The Hydrographic Confederation of the Cantabrian, has the first level of its web page
translated into Galician.

PARAGRAPH 2: With respect to the local and regional authorities in whose areas a

540

Sub-paragraph c: The acceptance, to the extent that this is possible, of the requests of

PARAGRAPH 5: The parties are obliged to allow, at the request of the interested parties,
the use or the adoption of patronymics in the regional or minority languages.

Law 3/1983, of 15 June, on Linguistic Standardisation, establishes in Article 3, that public
authorities in Galicia must adopt appropriate measures so that noone is discriminated
against for reasons of language; in Article 4.1 it stipulates that Galician, as the language of
Galicia, is the official language of the institutions of the autonomous community, of its
administration, of the local administration and of the public entities which depend on the
autonomous community; in Article 6.1, it establishes that the public have the right to the
use of Galician, both orally and in writing in their relations with public administration bodies
in the territorial area of the autonomous community; Article 6.2 establishes that
administrative actions in Galicia will be valid and will take effect, whatever the official
language used; in Article 6.3 it establishes that the public authorities of Galicia will promote
the normal use of the Galician language, both orally and in writing, in its relations with the
public; in Article 11.2, that in professional entrance exams for positions in the autonomous
and local administration bodies the level of understanding of the official languages will be
considered, among other merits and these will be considered for each professional level;
Article 25 states that the Galician government will foster the standardisation of the use of
Galician in commercial, advertising, cultural, associative, sporting and other activities.

Law 13/2007 of 27 July, the amendment of Law 4/1988 of 26 May on the Public Services
of Galicia, specifies in Article 33, that “in order to fulfil the standardisation of the Galician
language in the public administration of Galicia and in order to guarantee the right of the
public under this administration to the use of the language of Galicia in its relations with
public administration bodies in the area of the autonomous community and in compliance
with the obligation to promote the normal use of Galician by the public authorities of
Galicia, as established in Article 6.3 of the Law on Linguistic Standardisation in the
professional entrance exams which are undertaken for access to positions in the
administrative bodies of the autonomous community of Galicia and in the local bodies of
Galicia, an understanding of the Galician language must be demonstrated. To these
541

purposes, the bases of these awards will establish that one or more of the professional
entrance exams must be undertaken exclusively in Galician and this without prejudice to
other additional exams which may be required for those positions which require a special
knowledge of the Galician language”.

In the same manner, Law 4/2006 of 30 June, on Clarity and Good Practices in Galician
Public Administration establishes, in Article 2.j, that the entities which comprise its area of
application and the staff at its service will adapt their activities to promote the normal use
of Galician, both orally and in writing, in their relations with the public, without prejudicing
the right to non-discrimination for reasons of language; Article 15.2.7 states that the
members of the government and high-ranking members of the administration will normally
use Galician, both orally and in writing, in their relations with the public.

In turn, Decree 258/2006 of 28 December, through which the Interdepartmental
Commission of the Government of Galicia for Linguistic Standardisation was created,
establishes this commission as an organisation for the promotion and coordination of the
process of

linguistic standardisation in the area of autonomous administration. The

Interdepartmental Commission was created with the basic objective of promoting crosssector actions aimed at the promotion and the use of Galician in different departments,
general directorates and entities which depend on the Government of Galicia.

All of these actions form part of the norms established in the General Plan for the
Standardisation of the Galician Language, which established as an objective, the
guarantee that Galician is the language of normal use in autonomous administrative
processes for internal relations, in relations between the administrative bodies and in
relations with the public, which, in this manner consolidates Galician as a general
language of reference in the autonomous administration.

Law 3/1983 of 15 June, on Linguistic Standardisation, establishes in Article 4.1, that
Galician, as the language of Galicia, is the official language of the institutions of the
autonomous community, of its administration, of the local administration local and of the
public bodies which depend on the autonomous community. Article 6.4 of this law states
that the Government of Galicia will dictate necessary provisions for the progressive
standardisation of the use of Galician and local corporations must act in accordance with
542

the norms established in this law.

Furthermore, it must be noted at this point, that the draft for the amendment of Law
4/1998, of 26 May on the Public Services of Galicia extends the requirement for the
understanding of the Galician language to the professional exams which are undertaken
for access positions in local administrative bodies.

Article 7.1 of Law 5/1997 of 22 July, on the Local Administration of Galicia specifies that
Galician, as the language of Galicia is also the language of its local administration. It also
specifies that convocations for meetings, agendas, motions, individual votes, proposed
agreements, resolutions on committee reports, minutes, appeals, public deeds, court
appearances and all acts of a public or administrative character which are undertaken in
writing in the name of local corporations, will be drafted in Galician. Point 2 establishes,
without prejudicing that established in the previous paragraph, that these bodies may also
undertake these tasks in another official language; Spanish. Article 7.3 establishes that the
Government of Galicia will promote the process of incorporating the use of Galician into
local administration bodies, and specifically through training programmes in Galician for
civil servants in the local bodies.

As such, the General Plan for the Standardisation of the Galician Language, a text which
was approved in the Parliament of Galicia in September 2004 and which was first applied
in 2006, established as an objective, the guarantee that Galician is the language of normal
use in autonomous administrative processes for internal relations, in relations between the
administrative bodies and in relations with the public.

Every year the General Directorate of Local Administration assigns economic subsidies for
local bodies in Galicia. These subsidies are for: a) the maintenance of municipal and
provincial services of already existing linguistic standardisation; b) the creation of new
municipal and provincial services of linguistic standardisation; c) the organisation of
campaigns in order to achieve linguistic standardisation in local bodies. d) the
development of standardisation campaigns and campaigns for the use of Galician in the
documents and instruments used by in the office systems of local administration bodies.

Law 3/1983 of 15 June on Linguistic Standardisation establishes in Article 10, that
toponyms in Galicia will only be officially recognised in their Galician form and that the
543

determination of the official toponyms depends on the Government of Galicia.

All those professionals in public services must demonstrate an oral and written
understanding of the Galician language, both in the lists which regulate temporary
contracts and in the professional exams/competitions for permanent positions.

The Application of Article 11. The Communications Media

Paragraph 1. For the speakers of regional or minority languages, in the areas in which
the above-mentioned languages are spoken, according to the location of each area and to
the extent in which the public authorities, in a direct or indirect manner have the
jurisdiction, attributions or a role to play in the above-mentioned area, respecting at the
same time the principles of independence and autonomy of the press, the parties agree:

Sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent in that the radio and the television have a public
service mission, a: to guarantee the creation of at least one radio station and one
television channel in the regional or minority languages

Sub-paragraph b, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station in
the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

c, i) to foster and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television

channel in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph d: to foster and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph e, i): to foster and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of, at
least one press organisation in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

f, ii): to extend the existing measures of financial assistance to

audiovisual productions in regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for the
544

communications media which use the regional or minority languages.

Paragraph 2: The parties agree to guarantee the freedom of direct reception from radio
and television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language which is spoken in an
identical or similar manner to a regional or minority language, and to not oppose the
broadcasting of radio and television broadcasts of neighbouring countries in this language.
They are also obliged to ensure that no restriction on the freedom of expression and the
free circulation of information in a language spoken in an identical or similar manner to a
regional or minority language is imposed. The exercise of the freedoms mentioned above,
which entail duties and responsibilities, may be subject to certain procedures, conditions,
restrictions or sanctions established by the law, which constitute necessary measures in a
democratic society for national security, territorial integrity or public safety, the defence of
order and the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morality, the protection of the
reputation or the rights of others, in order to prevent the disclosure of confidential
information or to guarantee the authority and the impartiality of the judiciary.

Paragraph 3: The parties are obliged to ensure that the interest of the speakers of
regional or minority languages are represented or taken into consideration in the
framework of the structures which may be created in compliance with the law, in order to
guarantee the freedom and plurality of the media.

The interests of Galician speakers are represented in, among other bodies, the
Audiovisual Consortium of Galician, of which of the General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy
forms a part.

Law 9/1984 of 11 July establishes the creation of the Radiotelevision Company of Galicia
(CRTVG), which in paragraph 1.1 of Article 1 is attributed “the mission of public service
which is consistent in the promotion, divulgation and fostering of the Galician language". A
publicly-owned organisation thus exists in Galician which is responsible for the direct
management of the public services of radio and television broadcasting of the autonomous
community of Galicia.

In July 2006 the Government of Galicia, an organisation responsible for awarding the
545

digital television channels (DDT), granted licences for operating in Galicia. In these awards
it established linguistic clauses which commit companies to the production of a minimum
of 60% of their own production during the total broadcasting time. Of the 46 companies
which were awarded contracts, 20 agreed to broadcast 100% of their own production in
Galician. Another 20 companies agreed to broadcast a percentage in Galician of over
70%. The percentage of broadcasts in Galician in the other channels is no lower than
53%.

Both Galician Television (Televisión de Galicia - TVG) and Galician Radio (Radio GallegaRG) broadcast 24 hours a day in the Galician language. In the case of the RG, all
broadcasts are in Galician, as advertising, in addition to news and programmes of its own
production is in Galician. In the case of the TVG there is a minimum percentage of
advertising in Spanish.

The territorial broadcasting disconnections (transmission changeover) undertaken by
Spanish Television (Televisión Española) and Spanish National Radio (Radio Nacional de
España - RNE) mostly use Galician and employ a body of linguists which guarantee the
quality of the texts broadcast.

With respect to Spanish Television (TVE), the territorial area news programme is
broadcast in Galician. On the second channel of TVE, a daily broadcasting disconnection
(transmission changeover) of half an hour is made from Monday to Friday, which is allotted
to a news programme broadcast entirely in Galician. With respect to RNE, all autonomous
or provincial area disconnections (transmission changeovers) of RNE in Galicia, for both
National Radio and Radio 5 (115 minutes a day from Monday to Friday and 30 minutes on
Saturday and Sunday) are made in Galician and all the special programmes which are
broadcast due to extraordinary events in this community (among which is the Day of
Galician Literature, the broadcasting of the Regional Debate, etc.) are also undertaken in
Galician.

With respect to the area of municipally-owned public radio, some councils broadcast
entirely in Galician (for example the municipality of Fene). In 1988, the Association of
Galician Municipal Broadcasters was established (EMUGA) which brought together the
municipal stations of Fene, Oleiros, Negreira, Ribadavia, Corcubión and another ten
546

municipal radio stations.

With respect to private radio stations in Galicia, these broadcast in both languages, with a
predominant use of Spanish. In order to promote the use of Galician on those private radio
stations which operate in Galicia, the Government of Galicia has established a programme
of agreements from the Department of Linguistic Policy, which lend economic support to
daily programming in Galician. In 2006, 2007 and 2008 the radio stations with the largest
number of listeners were the beneficiaries of these agreements. The actions stipulated by
these agreements centre on the progressive increase in the presence of Galician in news
programmes, advertising and daily programmes.

Only private television channels with large audience figures make determined broadcasts
in Galician.

In Galicia the production and divulgation of audiovisual works in regional or minority
languages is regularly promoted and facilitated. As such, the aforementioned Audiovisual
Consortium of Galicia must be mentioned, which is an organisation created for the
institutional improvement of those actions which develop the audiovisual sector of Galicia.
Among its specific objectives is that of promoting the use of the Galician language through
its use in audiovisual media, specifically supporting its use in exhibition halls and
promoting attendance to these venues. In 2005, the General Secretariat of Linguistic
Policy entered this consortium in order to contribute to the divulgation of productions in the
Galician language throughout the world, through its network of Galician study centres in 43
universities. In May 2006 the first distribution of audiovisual materials was carried out in
Galician; these were supplied to universities with Galician study centres on the event of
the Day of Galician Literature.

During 2007 and 2008 the Ministry of Culture and Sport established four lines of subsidies
for audiovisual promotion: a) subsidies for the production of short films in Galician in their
original language version; b) subsidies for the individual writing of scripts for audiovisual
projects in Galician; c) subsidies for the development of audiovisual or interactive projects
in Galician and d) subsidies for audiovisual and interactive productions or co-productions
in Galician. The condition for the use of Galician in production was stipulated in the four
subsidies. The most noteworthy fact is found in the fourth series of subsidies as a new,
important feature was introduced; that of filming using Galician as the original production
547

language. After 2006 two channels were established for applying for these subsidies: a)
filming/recording in Galician – the main objective being to stimulate recording in Galician,
as well as exhibition in this language, when either subtitled or dubbed into other languages
when shown abroad; b) filming in another language which is not Galician, in which case
the capital must come mainly from Galicia and a significant percentage of employees must
be from Galicia. In this second case the obligation of dubbing production into Galician was
established.

Films and series broadcast by Galician Television are dubbed entirely into Galician.
Audience figures ratify that films dubbed in Galician and the same films dubbed into
Spanish are equally popular among television viewers.

Divulgation initiatives have been carried out, such as the distribution, in 2006 through the
best-selling newspaper La Voz de Galicia, of Galician films in their original language
version or dubbed into Galician, which were provided with the paper.

A newspaper is currently available in Galicia which is produced entirely in Galician: Galicia
Hoxe. Other single-language publications are also available in Galician, although on a
weekly basis (A Nosa Terra) or the fortnightly (O Sil, A Peneira, etc.). Numerous
specialised monthly publications also exist (culture, economy, new technology, Galician
fashion, etc.) which are also monolingual or largely in Galician.

The rest of the daily press publications in Galicia are bilingual, given the characteristics of
the

languages jointly used in the

territory (languages which are related and inter-

comprehensible) in addition to the level of knowledge of the Galician language held by
almost the entire population.

In addition to those cited above, daily press publications with a digital format are available
through the Internet, such as those detailed below. www.vieiros.com is, according to
figures provided by Alexa, the second largest digital newspaper in Galicia in terms of
readers. It is published exclusively in Galician.

Other digital media, such as www.codigocero.com, are more specialised publications
which centre on the area of technology, with information entirely in Galician. The remaining
digital titles are bilingual (xornal.com, noticiasgalicia.com, etc.). La Voz de Galicia, the
548

newspaper with the largest publication figures of papers printed in Galicia, has produced a
double version of its digital publication (www.lavozdegalica.es) since May 2006 in both
Galician and in Spanish (readers can even set up the page in one or another language for
direct access), although there are still linguistic deficiencies in its Galician version.

Blogs are proliferating in Galicia. There are still no reliable figures for the number of
consultations or for their impact, however it must be noted that they are largely produced
in Galician.

In order to promote the presence of monolinguistic themes, and to foster the progressive
increase of the presence of the Galician language in the bilingual media, in 2006 the
General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Government of Galicia began a series of
initiatives aimed at facilitating the presence of Galician in the communications media.
These include: a) offering media publications the licence for the use of an automatic
Spanish-Galician translator (the ES-GL translator); b) the holding of subsidies and
agreements with publicly and privately-owned written media productions which establish
common clauses in order to guarantee the joint advance of all the publications; this obliges
the bilingual media to annually increase the percentage of their use with respect to the
previous year by a minimum of 10%; c) with respect to monolingual digital and printed
media publications in Galician, economic subsidies were also provided for the publication
of complementary materials of a varied character and in accordance with the
characteristics of each media (pastimes for leisure, economic supplements, etc.), and d)
the signing of agreements with news agencies which operate in Galician in order to
facilitate production in Galician for those media publications which use their services. In
2006 AGN and Europa Press experienced a major advance in linguistic use.

The Application of Article 12. Culture

Paragraph 1. With respect to activities and cultural services, especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, in
addition to literary works and film production, traditional cultural expression, festivals,
cultural industries, including in particular, the use of new technology, the parties, in what is
referred to as the territory in which the aforementioned languages are spoken and to the
extent in which the public authorities have authority, attributions or a role to play in the
549

area, agree:

The Government of Galicia, from the Ministry of Culture, promotes festivals, events and
competitions which are aimed at establishing and fostering the use of Galician in the
autonomous community. As such it promotes theatre festivals through the Galician
Institute of the Scenic and Musical Arts which has its own auditorium, while it also supports
activities of this type which have been programmed by local administration bodies or by
public and private bodies which act within the territory. It also supports the presence of
these activities abroad, given the importance of Galician communities located around the
world.

Sub-paragraph a): to foster the expression and the initiatives of the regional or minority
languages and to encourage the different means of access to works produced in these
languages;

The area of influence of the Ministry of Culture:

The Promotion of Film and Audiovisual Media

Current Legislation on the Subject
Law 55/2007 of 28 December on Film, in Article 36 establishes that “In order to attend to
the promotion and protection of the use of the co-official languages distinct to Spanish in
films and audiovisual media, promoting the cultural plurality of Spain and the equal
opportunities of the languages of each territory with respect to audiovisual expression and
divulgation, a fund or subsidies or specific credits will be established which will be
transferred entirely to the competent bodies of the autonomous communities which will
administer them in accordance with their powers. This state contribution, based on the
principle of co-responsibility, will be provided each year in the General State Budgets and
will be destined to the production, distribution, exhibition and promotion of the film and
audiovisual industry in the above-mentioned languages”.

The Additional Sixth Stipulation of the Law of Film, which relates to the agreements for the
fostering of film and audiovisual media in co-official languages distinct from Spanish,
550

establishes that “The Ministry of Culture, by agreement, will determine those credits
established in Article 36 of the Law, in a way such that the funding received by each
autonomous community in the co-official language, is the annual equivalent to the sum of
contributions which this community has made during the previous financial year for the
support and fostering of the production, distribution and promotion of the audiovisual
industry in the co-official language distinct to Spanish. The funding received by each
autonomous community will not exceed 50 percent of the total of the subsidies which
audiovisual companies resident in this community have received from the ICAA during the
previous financial year”.

Royal Decree 2062/2008 of the 12th of December, which modifies the Law of Film in
Article 19.3, regulates the above-mentioned Article 36.

Relevant actions undertaken

In the general state budgets for 2008, a subsidy of 2,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the Film and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) from the Ministry of Culture for this
purpose, and which was transferred to the Autonomous Community of Galicia for the
amount of 652,500 €

In the general state budgets for 2009, a subsidy of 10,500,000 euros was registered in the
budget of the ICAA from the Ministry of Culture for this purpose, and which was distributed
by means of the corresponding participatory agreements.

Previous to the aforementioned Law of Film, Royal Decree 526/2002, of 14 December
established facilities for obtaining subsidies for the amortization of films by producers who
made films whose original version was in a co-official language distinct from Spanish.
These subsidies have been made available from 2003 to the present day.

The Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

The Ministry of Culture fulfils a constitutional mandate in all the activities which it carries
out, according to which, the diversity of the different linguistic forms of Spain is a cultural
heritage which will be subject to special respect and protection.
551

Those subsidies open to competition are listed below, the bases of the award regulations
stipulate that they are open to all the co-official languages of the state and aim to
encourage private intercommunication between the Spanish cultures. Members of
business associations or the academies of these languages form part of the evaluation
committees with respect to some of these subsidies:

Subsidies for non-profit companies and institutions, publishers of cultural
magazines written in any co-official language of Spain. The objective of these subsidies
is to attain the free distribution of cultural magazines in the distinct official languages of
Spain, in languages and cultural centres in Spain and abroad, among those subsidised
every year are magazines published in these co-official languages

Subsidies for the promotion of reading and the divulgation of Spanish literature,
through the undertaking of activities which promote common Spanish culture in Spain
and abroad, through conferences, seminars, etc., the participation and celebration of
commemorations and centennials – especially of writers -, the fostering of reading
habits and the promotion of the use of public libraries. Among those subsidised every
year are activities which are undertaken in the co-official languages.

Subsidies for the publication in any co-official language of Spain of literary works.
This award subsidises projects for publishing works from our culture, of national and
international projection in the co-official languages of Spain, which contribute to the
enrichment of our common bibliographic heritage, with the dual objective of extending
the funds of the public libraries of Spain and fostering and encouraging communication
and cultural cohesion between the autonomous communities, creating a common
bibliographic archive in all public libraries.

National Literature Awards

In those juries which take part in the National Literature Awards of the Ministry of
Culture, representatives of the academies of the co-official languages are included, and
in the criteria of these awards it is stated that works and authors in any of the Spanish
languages may be proposed. Many of these awards have been given to works written in
552

the co-official languages.

The Promotion of the Scenic Arts and Music

During the 2006-2008 period, the Directorate General of the National Institute of the
Scenic Arts and Music (INAEM) has followed a policy to promote expression in the
regional languages of Spain in its awards of subsidies for programmes of divulgation,
development and the preservation of the theatre and the circus and theatre and circusorientated communication.

To this end the National Institute of Scenic Arts and Music dictated the resolutions of 26
December 2005, of 26 February 2007 and of 8 February 2008, which make subsidies
available for programmes for the divulgation, development and preservation of the
theatre and the circus and theatre and circus-orientated communication for the years
2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
The requirements established for participating in the programme of theatre divulgation
in the national area are made flexible if the theatre productions are performed solely in
one of the official languages distinct from Spanish. This flexibility consists in the nonapplication of two conditions which are compulsory for other requests: firstly, that
touring projects are undertaken in at least three autonomous communities, and in
second place, that at least 40% of the performances take place outside the autonomous
community which corresponds to the company address of the applicant requesting the
subsidy.

Sub-paragraph b): to encourage different means of access in other languages to works
produced in the regional or minority languages, aiding and developing the activities of
translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling;

Sub-paragraph c): to encourage access in the regional or minority languages to works
produced in other languages, aiding and developing the activities of translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling;

The Ministry of Culture awards the following subsidies for translation each year:

Subsidies for the translation and publication in any foreign language of literary or
553

scientific works by Spanish authors, which were originally written and published in any
of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture overseas. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.

Subsidies for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain
into other co-official languages of Spain, which were originally written and published in
any of the languages of Spain. These subsidies seek to divulge and promote Spanish
culture in Spain. These subsidies are open to any work from Spain written in any coofficial language.

Sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
various forms of cultural activities suitably integrate the understanding and the practice of
the languages and of the regional or minority cultures in the activities whose initiative
depends on the latter or those who provide their support.
The Divulgation of Information on Web Pages

The Ministry of Culture, the National Library and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina
Sofía all offer information in the co-official languages of the state on their individual web
pages, so promoting multi-lingual policies in the promotion of its cultural programme.
The National Library also has a channel on Youtube in which all the videos are transcribed
into the different co-official languages of the state.

The Divulgation of Information through other Informational Material

Temporary Exhibitions

In the temporary exhibitions organised by the Ministry of Culture, in state museums
which are managed solely by the ministry which are located in autonomous
communities with a co-official language, both the information in the hall (signs,
informative texts, etc.) and material publicising the exhibition (triptychs, posters,
press adverts, etc.) are produced in Spanish and in the respective co-official
language.

554

As such, in other exhibitions held in autonomous communities with a co-official
language in which the ministry cooperates with other institutions of a general
character, both languages are used in the exhibition material.

The National Museum of El Prado.
The Museum of El Prado has produced informative material in the different coofficial languages of the state. This material consisted in the translation of the map
which is provided for visitors at the information points located in the museum's
access areas. The examples and years in which these were translated into Galician
are as follows: 2008 – 2,500 copies; 2007 – 8,000 copies; 2006 – 1,000 copies.

The continued translation of the map is planned for the coming years as stated in
the Action Plan of the National Museum of El Prado (2009-2012), as part of the
objectives to be developed by the Visitor Attention Area.

The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía

This museum plans to adapt its general material (which includes leaflets on the
permanent collections, maps and general information about the museum) into all
the co-official languages of the state as soon as possible.

The Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute (IPCE)

This institute now has the main contents of its web page translated into the coofficial languages and will also implement multi-linguistic divulgation through the
progressive translation of some of the publications which comprise the Publishing
Programme of the IPC over the coming years.

Sub-paragraph

e): to promote the provision of bodies responsible for organising or

supporting cultural activities with staff who are fluent in the regional or minority language,
in addition to the language(s) of the rest of the population;

Sub-paragraph f): to promote the direct participation, with respect to the services and
programmes of cultural activities of representatives of speakers of the regional or minority
language.

Sub-paragraph

g): to foster and/or facilitate the creation of one or several bodies

responsible for collecting, receiving in bond and presenting or publishing works produced
557

in regional or minority languages.

With respect to actions undertaken by the Ministry of Culture:

1. The Deposit of Published Works

The National Library acts as the organisation for depositing works published in any
language within Spanish territory.

2. Reference collections

The National Library has reference collections in different subjects in all the co-official
languages of Spain.

Sub-paragraph h): where appropriate, to create and/or promote and finance translation
and terminological investigation services with a view, specifically, to maintain and develop
in each regional or minority language, the administrative, commercial, economic, social,
technological or legal terminology appropriate.

Paragraph 2. With respect to those territories distinct from those in which the regional or
minority languages are used traditionally, the parties agree to authorise, foster and/or
provide, appropriate activities or cultural services, in compliance with the above paragraph,
if the number of speakers of a regional or minority language justifies this.

Paragraph 3: The parties agree, in their cultural policy abroad, to provide an appropriate
place for the regional or minority languages and to the culture which these languages
express.

The area of Galician society, where use of the language is greater is undoubtedly the
cultural sector. The activities undertaken in the area of culture, whether of private or public
initiative, are largely undertaken in Galician throughout the entire process: creation,
marketing, staging, etc.

Some of the cultural organisations of Galicia and their tasks are listed below:

558

1. The Government of Galicia and especially its Ministry of Culture and Tourism,
supports those manifestations of a cultural character which different entities and
institutions in its territory offer for establishing the corresponding cooperation
agreements, specific subsidies and regulated grants.
This important task also includes campaigns for the promotion of reading and the
promotion of classical authors of Galician literature, through distinct activities, among
which is the commemoration of the Day of Galician Literature, which each year recalls
a person linked to written works from Galicia. In this manner it undertakes activities
which bring noteworthy authors into contact with the public.
The Galician Insititute of the Scenic and Musical Arts depends on the Ministry of
Culture and Tourism; it undertakes all its activities in Galician - this includes the
initiation of the complex project of the city of culture and the management of eight
museums, which are distributed evenly throughout the area of Galicia and in which all
information appears in Galician at least.
Traditionally, the Government of Galicia has subsidised the publication of books in
Galician.
In 2008 the Ministry of Culture and Sport implemented a series of subsidies for the
development of the production of interactive digital contents in Galician. Interactive
digital contents are understood to be those productions which comprise information
represented in multiple expressive formats (text, sound, static image or moving image
and digitally-coded images). These subsidy awards were open to projects for the
Internet, interactive digital television, video-games consoles and cellular phone
applications.
This activity sought new means to convey the use of the resources of the information
society to the Galician public in order to promote public access to the Internet through
the increase of contents related to the language and culture of Galicia, and strengthen
the Galician industry in the production of interactive, innovative and quality digital
contents while fostering creativity and innovation in companies.
2. The Institute of the Galician Language (ILG) is a university research centre which was
created in 1971 by the University of Santiago de Compostela in order to promote the
cultivation and the standardisation of the Galician language, while advancing in its
synchronic and diachronic research. After more than three decades its fundamental
559

objectives are still: a) the undertaking of scientific and technical research in the area of
the Galician language, both in its synchronic and diachronic reality; b) the undertaking
of teaching and training activities through doctorate programmes, postgraduate
courses, continual training courses and specialisation courses; c) the training of
specialists in Galician and the training, specialisation and recycling of professionals in
the area of Galician linguistics, especially of non-university education; d) the technical
assessment of institutions and of persons related to the standardisation of the Galician
language; e) the assessment, with respect to teaching and investigation of Galician
organisations and institutions in Spain, developing countries and international
organisations who request it; f) the promotion and participation in the organisation of
conferences, scientific meetings, seminars, debates, open days and similar activities
which are related to the nature and the functions of the ILG; g) the establishment and
coordination of relations for the exchange of technical and specialised information with
institutions from other autonomous communities and countries; and h) the divulgation
of information which is considered of interest in the area of the Galician language,
especially the divulgation of the results of linguistic investigation in university and
research areas. The contribution of this institute in defining Standard Galician is
noteworthy.

3. The Ramón Piñeiro Centre for Research into the Humanities was created by Decree
25/1993, of 11 February. This centre depends directly on the Galician government and
it began its activities in March 1994. Since then it has published 123 books (all of which
are in Galician) and it has incorporated important resources on the Internet such as; a)
an automatic Spanish-Galician translator which is currently operable, among other
areas in the administration; b) the COTOVIA text-voice converter, which synthesises a
masculine

and

feminine

voice

with

from the Internet to all Medieval Latin documentation from Galicia and to all Galician
Medieval lyrical work (CODOLGA) (http://balteira.cirp.es/codolga/); e) a corpus of

(http://www.cirp.es/cdn/cfg/cfg.html). This centre is also responsible for the construction
of the Galician Phraseological Treasury.

4. The Royal Galician Academy is the body responsible for establishing norms in the
Galician language and it also takes the final decisions on questions of Galician
terminology, a task encharged to TERMIGAL (Servizo de Terminoloxía Galega), which
has been in operation for 10 years through an agreement between the Galician Royal
Academy and the Government of Galicia. This institution is the oldest of those which
are still active in Galicia, as it was founded on 30 September 1906.

5. The Council of Galician Culture (El Consello da Culture Galega) undertakes, in addition
to its functions as a consultative body, investigation in different areas of culture
(language, communication, history, art, etc.), in thematic sections with its respective
commissions. The Council of Galician Culture or CCG is an institution which was
established in the Statute of Autonomy of Galicia (Article 32) and created by Law
8/1983 of 8 July. Its responsibilities include: a) the assessment of the powers of the
autonomous community in that necessary for the defence and promotion of the cultural
values of the Galician people; b) the provision to the powers of the autonomous
community reports and proposals in favour of the defence and promotion of the cultural
values of the Galician people.

The reports of the CGC on the state of the Galician language are made public and are
accessible at (http://www.culturegalega.org). Among the most recent are Lingua e
territorio (2006) and Situación do ensino da lingua e da literatura galega en la E.S.O.
(2008).

6) The Social Council of the Galician Language (El Consello Social da Lingua Galega),
which was held on 27 December 2004, is presided over by the Mayor of the city of
561

Vigo, with a Vice president who is a member of the Galician Royal Academy. Three
other people also form part of the council who have recognised abilities in the field of
linguistic standardisation, in addition to representatives of each one of the political
groups represented on Vigo city council. There are also 19 members on the council
who represent various social, cultural, business, political, religious and sporting bodies.

The objectives of this institution are to assess, consult and participate in linguistic
policy in order to attain the standardisation of Galician in the society of the city of Vigo.
The functions of the Social Council of the Galician Language are as follows:

a)

To evaluate the objectives and results of the council's linguistic policy, with a
ruling, each year, on the actions promoted by the council.

b)

To study and analyse, together with linguistic standardisation, questions relating
to the fostering and the promotion of Galician in society.

c)

To make rulings on those linguistic planning projects which are to be approved by
the city council.

d)

To propose the creation of studies and rulings with respect to the adoption of
correct measures for standardising language to the city council.

Publication in Galician experienced a notable increase from the end of the nineteenseventies, with an increase in the number of publishing companies and of production.

Until 1979 the catalogue of books published in Galician totalled 1,904. Publishing
production during the decade of the nineteen-eighties exceeded 3,000 titles in Galician. In
the nineties this amount tripled, reaching a publishing boom in the first four years of the
21st century with over 6,000 titles. There are publishing companies today with a catalogue
which exceeds 3,000 titles. According to data from the National Institute of Statistics, the
publication of books in Galician rose in 2008 by 60% with respect to 2007. According to
this body, 3,242,000 copies were published in

2007 in Galicia and 5,240,000 were

published in 2008. From this total, just over 53% were in Galician, which means that in
Galicia the number of copies published in Galician exceeds those published in Spanish.

The Parliament of Galicia approved Law 17/2006 of 27 December on Books and Reading
in Galicia, which recognises books as a strategic sector and the cultural dimension of
books. The main aim of the law is the promotion of the social extension of reading and of
562

books and reading in Galician.

The Assessment Council for Books is a permanent investigation body in the book sector
which provides assessment to the autonomous administration with respect to policies
related to the Galician book sector and the promotion of reading in Galicia.

The Club of Books and Libraries aims to ensure the presence of new publications in
Galician and focuses on their provision and updating.

With respect to the Ministry of Culture:

1. Book Fairs and the Delivery of Bibliographic Packs to Cultural Centres
In international book fairs which Spain attends with its own pavilion or through the
administration of embassies, new publications which are displayed will include books and
magazines in all the languages of Spain, partly from the subsidies provided to editors of
magazines and the publication of books. The same applies to the packs of books sent to
libraries and cultural centres.

Furthermore, with respect to the mobility of authors overseas in fairs, conferences, etc.,
Spanish authors will participate in these, regardless of the co-official language in which
they write.

With respect to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation:

The Cervantes Institute reports that it has signed various participatory agreements with
several cultural institutions for the divulgation of the co-official languages as part of
overseas cultural policy. This includes academic and teaching activities with the following
institutions: the Ramón Llull Institute, the Royal Academy of the Vasca-Euskaltzaindia
Language, the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language, the Galician Royal Academy of
Language and the Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Galician Government.

The Cervantes Institute has been offering courses for learning Catalan, Galician and
563

Basque since the academic year of 1994-1995. Several graphs are shown, detailing the
development of the courses held over the last few years.

The Application of Article 13. Social and Economic Life

Paragraph 1. With respect to economic and social activities and for the entire country, the
parties agree:

Sub-paragraph a) to exclude from their legislation all provisions which prohibit or limit,
without justifiable reasons, the use of regional or minority languages in those documents
which relate to economic or social life and especially in work contracts and technical

564

documents, such as instructions for the use of products or services;

Sub-paragraph b) to prohibit the insertion, in the internal regulations of companies and in
private documents, of clauses which exclude or limit the use of regional or minority
languages, at least among the speakers of the same language;
Sub-paragraph c) to oppose those practices which lead to the discouragement of the use
of regional or minority languages in social or economic activities;

During the 2006-2008 period, those activities undertaken to promote the use of Galician in
economic activities were channelled, basically through a participatory agreement between
the General Secretariat of Linguistic Policy and the Confederation of Businessmen of
Galicia with respect to linguistic standardisation. The aims of this agreement were:
•

To improve the knowledge and use of the Galician language in the economic fabric of
Galicia, mainly through the offer of specific courses and of linguistic contents in courses of
general subjects.

•

To promote and increase the standardisation of the Galician language in businesses
which undertake their economic activity in the autonomous community of Galicia. To this
end a service of linguistic standardisation was set up, whose main objective was to offer
efficient solutions to the linguistic needs of companies. As such the website
www.normalizacion.ceg.es was set up in order to provide businesses with more facilities
when incorporating the Galician language into their activities.

•

To undertake linguistic dynamisation activities.

•

To assess Galician and foreign companies in the use of the Galician language in their
commercial relations.

•

To consolidate the standardisation of the use of Galician in the Confederation of Galician
Businessmen and in their respective provincial confederations.

One of the actions aimed at the promotion of Galician in the commercial and economic
sector was the campaign undertaken in 2007 in order to extend the use of Galician in the
labelling of wine bottles and also ensure that consumers could choose those bottles
labelled in Galician.

An initiative for the promotion of Galician in social activities is the maintenance of a series
of subsidies for non-profit making associations. During 2006, 2007 and 2008, more than
565

one thousand projects were provided with the economic resources necessary for their
implementation. Another initiative of a social character was the initiation of the Volunteer
Programme for Linguistic Activation (El Programa de Voluntariado de Activación
Lingüística).

Sub-paragraph d) To facilitate and/or foster, through other means, distinct from those
considered in the sections above, the use of regional or minority languages.

Paragraph 2. With respect to economic and social activities and to the extent that the
public authorities are able, the parties, in the territory in which the regional or minority
languages are spoken and as far as is reasonably possible, agree:

Sub-paragraph a) to define, through financial and banking regulations, provisions which
allow, in conditions consistent with commercial practice, the use of regional or minority
languages in the drafting of payment orders (cheques, letters of exchange,etc.), or other
financial documents or, where applicable to seek to apply this process;

Sub-paragraph b) in the economic and social sectors which depend directly on their
control (the public sector) to undertake actions which foster the use of the regional or
minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

c) to ensure that those social services, such as hospitals, old age

persons residences and shelters, offer the possibility of receiving and attending the
speakers of a regional or minority language who need care for reasons of health, age or
other reasons in their language;
Sub-paragraph d) to ensure, by the appropriate means, that safety instructions are also
written in the regional or minority languages;

Sub-paragraph

e) to facilitate in the regional or minority languages, the information

provided by the competent authorities on the rights of consumers.

Article 25 of Law 3/1983 of 15 June, on Linguistic Standardisation, stipulates that the
Galician government and the local corporations within their area will foster the
standardisation of the use of Galician in mercantile, advertising, cultural, associative,
566

sporting and other activities. With this aim and through specific actions, they may grant
reductions or extension of tax obligations. As such, reference must be made to the
concession of subsidies to private companies, professional associations, business
associations, chambers of commerce and organisations and non-profit making
associations in order to promote the use of the Galician language.

Furthermore, according to data provided by the Galician Council of Labour Relations (El
Consello Galego de Relacións Laborais) 20% of collective agreements signed in 2007
include clauses on the language, which affects 75,631 workers. The most frequent clauses
refer to the right of workers to undertake their professional activity in Galician and to
receive linguistic training. Reference is also made in other clauses to non-discrimination
due to use of language. Also stipulated is that company headquarters must promote the
use of Galician in internal and external activities, some agreements add that the use of
Galician in relations with clients and administrative bodies must be promoted. Other types
of clauses refer to the drafting and publication of the collective agreement in Galician or in
a bilingual format and that this will also be undertaken with respect to advertisements,
notes, etc, which are posted on company noticeboards in addition, in some cases, to this
requirement for contracts and payrolls. There are also clauses which relate to the
evaluation of the understanding of Galician in the applications and contests made for
transfers in workforce conventions and those agreements made regarding civil service
employees in town councils which was signed in 2007.

The incorporation of the use of Galician in financial and banking documents is slow, but
progressive. The option of using Galician is active in the majority of automatic cash
dispensers and in certain cases is activated automatically when a card is inserted, with
respect to the option which clients have chosen previously. However, advertising for
savings banks has existed for some time in Galician or in bilingual format, and these banks
undertake important activities with respect to cultural promotion in Galician. Notary deeds
for mortgages are already being written in Galician.

The official language for external communications and signs in Galician health centres
which depend on the Galician Health Service (SERGAS) is Galician. Forms and medical
prescriptions are in Galician. All reglamentary documentation in addition to I.T.
applications in the Ministry of Health and SERGAS is in Galician. In centres such as the
Hospital Complex of the University of Santiago de Compostela, for example, all internal
567

communication for staff (notifications, messages, etc) is in Galician.
Those signs which are made by centre employees are mostly in Spanish.

Every month the Ministry of Health publishes informational booklets which refer to different
aspects of health: illnesses, hygiene recommendations, lifestyle habits, etc. Most of these
publications are produced in Galician.

Since the approval of Law 13/2007, on Galician Public Services, medical personnel, in
order to be accepted for their positions, must undertake an exercise in Galician. In the
same manner, in the professional entrance exams an understanding of Galician must be
verified. In transfer competitions, understanding of Galician is also an element which is
evaluated.

The use of Galician in surgeries by medical staff is not easily measurable. There have
been complaints from patients who have stated that they were not attended in Galician
after requesting the use of this language, although the number of complaints is small.

Since 2007 the General Secretariat of Wellbeing has demanded that those employees
who are accepted to posts in large centres must pass professional entrance exams which
include the understanding of Galician.

In the area of industrial production, two norms are applied: With respect to the use of
Galician in the labelling and the advertising of products which are sold in Galicia, Decree
101/85 of 23 May refers to the possibility of using Galician (alone or at the same level as
Spanish) in the labelling of packages or on the information of packages of products which
are sold in the territorial area of the autonomous community. Its third article establishes
that the Ministry of Health and Consumption may establish subsidies or awards for those
companies which sell their products in Galician in the community, or which use Galician in
labelling, on signs and in advertising. Also applicable is the Decree of 16 June 1994 on the
Use of the Galician Language in the Labelling of Products and Information for Consumers
and Users in Galicia.

The labelling of products in Galicia is governed by Royal Decree 134/1999 in the General
Regulation of Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Food Products. In Article 18, on
language in labelling, it establishes that; “the indications of food products which are sold in
568

Spain will be expressed in the official Spanish language of the state at least”, however, it
adds that “That stipulated in the previous paragraph will not be applied to traditional
products made and distributed exclusively in the area of an autonomous community with
its own official language".

In the labelling of some products from Galicia the incorrect use of place names still occurs.
When an error of this type is detected, the Government of Galicia notifies the company
responsible and informs them of the correct place name.

In 2008 the Government of Galicia approved the regulatory bases for the award of
subsidies for the area of commerce for various initiatives. An evaluation criteria is
considered for all of these subsidies which will be used as a basis for the determination of
preference in the award and the amount of the subsidy, the commitment to usage and the
subsequent use of Galician on all signs and in all applicable areas.

The Application of Article 14. Cross-border exchanges

The parties agree:
Sub-paragraph a) to apply the existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which
link them with the states in which the same language is spoken in an identical or
similar manner or seek to bring them to a conclusion, if necessary - such that they
encourage contacts between the speakers of the same language in the
corresponding states in the areas of culture, teaching, information, professional
education and permanent education;

Sub-paragraph b) to the benefit of the regional or minority languages, to facilitate
and/or promote cross-border cooperation, particularly between regional or local
groups in whose areas the same language is spoken in an identical or similar
manner.

With respect to territorial cooperation between Spain and Portugal, the interests of the
Galician language are promoted in several Territorial Cooperation Agreements in which
Spanish and Portuguese territorial organisations participate on the signing of these
instruments of cooperation in the Galician language and the recognition of Galician as the
569

normal working language.

By way of example this is the case of the Cross-border Agreement between the
autonomous community of Galicia and the Commission of Coordination and Regional
Development of the North of Portugal, which adapts the constitutive agreement of the
Galicia-North of Portugal Community of Work to the provisions of the treaty between the
Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic on cross-border cooperation between
territorial organisations and bodies (BOE of 17 May 2006), which states that “both parties
sign and endorse this convention in four copies for each one of the versions in
Portuguese, Spanish and Galician, all of them being equally valid, on the place and on the
date given in the heading”.

3.3. VALENCIAN (AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF VALENCIA)

Information on this language was obtained after consultations with the Valencian
Government (Generalitat Valenciana), the affected Ministries (National Government) and
“Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española, S. A.”, Corporación RTVE (Spanish Radio
and Television Corporation).

INTRODUCTION

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the socio-linguistic studies carried out on the Autonomous
Community of Valencia were not general studies but rather focused on specific areas or
populations. Thus, studies were carried out on the cities with most inhabitants: Valencia,
Alicante and towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants. A survey was also carried out on
the European population resident in the Community of Valencia. All the sociolinguistic
studies may be consulted on the following web page:
http://www.edu.gva.es/polin/val/sies/sies_fonum.htm

The following table presents data of the population in the Spanish-speaking area, obtained
from the total population of the municipalities declared as such in Article 36 of the Law on
the Use and Teaching of Valencian.

1.

With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
such languages are used, according to the situation of each of these
languages, and without prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of
the State:

a) Pre-school Education

i) to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or minority languages;
or
ii) to make available a substantial part of pre-school education in the relevant regional or
minority languages; or
iii) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii above at least to those pupils
whose families so request and whose number is considered sufficient; or
iv) if the public authorities have no direct competence in the field of pre-school education,
to favour and/or encourage the application of the measures referred to under i and iii
above;
b) Primary Education
i) to make available primary education in the relevant regional or minority languages; or
ii) to make available a substantial part of primary education in the relevant regional or
minority languages; or
iii) to provide, within primary education, for the teaching of the relevant regional or minority
languages as an integral part of the curriculum; or
iv) to apply one of the measures provided for under i and ii above at least to those pupils
whose families so request and whose number is considered sufficient; or

All students in the Autonomous Community of Valencia can receive education in Valencian
in these stages. Nevertheless, this education has certain specific characteristics in the
Spanish-speaking populations.

572

Students enrolled in municipalities in the predominantly Spanish-speaking zone represent
14% of all pupils in the initial stages of education, namely Pre-School and Primary
Education. Furthermore, increasingly fewer families or pupils in this area request
exemption from studying Valencian.

The Regional Ministry of Education plans informative campaigns to provide information on
and promote Valencian amongst the educational community. These campaigns consist of
different actions and objectives depending on the main languages in each area and the
different educational levels. Advisors on the teaching of Valencian from the Regional
Ministry of Education hold meetings with the parents of pupils in collaboration with schools
and education authorities in the municipalities. These meetings are called prior to the
school enrolment period.

573

The main aim of the campaigns launched in the predominantly Spanish-speaking area is
to promote the teaching of the Valencian language.

In the predominantly Valencian-speaking area [VSA], the aim is to promote teaching in

In the predominantly Valencian-speaking zone, the families of pupils or students of legal
age may request to be exempted from evaluation of Valencian, but not from learning
Valencian, in two circumstances. Firstly, if the student has just enrolled in the Valencian
education system and therefore lacks knowledge of the language. In such cases, the pupil
is exempted from assessment during the first year at school in Valencia, but is obliged to
attend class and to learn the language. These students are given the opportunity to attend
extra classes to improve their Valencian. They are then assessed in their second year at
school in Valencia although the objectives and contents of the programme are adapted to
their level of knowledge.

The second scenario in which exemption may be requested is when such families can
justify that their residence in the Autonomous Community is temporary, for a maximum of
two years. These are normally people and families who move to Valencia to work for a
specific period and then return to their habitual place of residence.

575

Students requesting exemption in all stages of education in the Valencian-speaking zone
account for barely 0.6% of all students. The following table shows the exemptions in the

576

Vocational training is mainly provided at secondary education institutes (Institutos de
Educación Secundaria - IES). So far, very few centres specifically offer vocational training.
Therefore, subjects can be taught in Valencian at these secondary education institutes,
depending on each centre and on the availability of teaching staff qualified to teach these
subjects in Valencian.

The educational system in the Community of Valencia considers that Valencian is the
language proper and official language of the Community of Valencia, as declared in the
1982 Statute of Autonomy and in its subsequent reform in 2006. The 1983 Law on the Use
and Teaching of Valencian is the basic regulation that introduced the teaching of
Valencian as a subject and teaching language. It defines two territories in relation to the
teaching of Valencian. Article 35 provides a list of predominantly Valencian-speaking
municipalities, in accordance with historical criteria, and Article 36 contains a list of
predominantly Spanish-speaking municipalities. This territorial vision only applies to
education since Valencian is the official language for all purposes in the entire Community
of Valencia.
In the predominantly Spanish-speaking municipalities, Valencian is a voluntary subject in
schools. Parents and legal tutors of students in non-university education may request
exemption from studying Valencian.
Valencian and Spanish are not offered as subjects in Vocational Training. Subjects are
taught indistinctly in Valencian or Spanish depending on the bilingual education
programme or programmes applied at the centre.
The data for the teaching of Valencian at vocational training centres are included in the
data for secondary education institutes, which are the centres where vocational training is
provided. Therefore, the data corresponding to vocational training are included in the
overall data for secondary education centres, as follows:

languages.
ii) to provide facilities for the study of these languages as university and higher education
subjects.

Public universities in Valencia ask students to select the language in which they wish to
study. They are asked to select language when they enrol at university. In 2007/2008,
Valencian students responded in very different ways. The following table orders the
universities in Valencia from north to south, and reveals a very strong gradation between
universities further to the north compared with universities further to the south.
Students at universities in Castellón de la Plana and Valencia expressed a much greater
preference for studying in Valencian than those at universities in Alicante and Elche.

f) Adult Education.

i) to arrange for the provision of adult and continuing education courses which are taught
mainly or wholly in the regional or minority languages.

Valencian is compulsory in secondary education graduate programmes offered at Adult
Training Centres owned by the Valencian Government and at municipal centres.

At these centres, the Regional Ministry of Education organises annual courses to promote
knowledge of Valencian for adults, regardless of their level of training and academic
qualifications. These courses are developed under the Adult Training Programme in order
to promote knowledge of the situation of Valencian in all areas, and specifically of all
matters relating to the Valencian language and culture.

The Plan aims to broaden oral and written knowledge of Valencian. Four (4) levels have
been established: Basic Training 1, Basic Training 2, Further Training 1 and Further
Training 2. In the period 2006-2008, the courses and participants in this programme were
as follows:

Certification of knowledge of Valencian in the adult population

The Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian Language (Junta Qualificadora
de Coneixements de Valencià - JQCV) was created by Regional Ministry of Education
Decree 173/1985, of 28 October, in order to organise examinations on knowledge of
Valencian for adults. The first examinations were held in 1986. Since then, 1,140,711
people have registered to obtain these certificates.

579

The JQCV accredits the following categories of certificates: Certificate of Oral Knowledge
of Valencian, Elementary Certificates, Intermediate Certificates and Advanced Certificates.
It also holds technical knowledge examinations in administrative language, text correction
and language in the media.

In this period, the numbers of persons who registered to obtain Valencian knowledge
certificates at each level were as follows:

Additionally, in order to facilitate access to Valencian, basic conversation guides have
been published in the following languages: English, Russian, French, Italian, German and
Rumanian.

ii) to offer such languages as subjects of adult and continuing education.

580

Adults can learn Valencian at adult education centres provided that the students and
teachers agree on the vehicular language.

g) to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the culture
which is reflected by the regional or minority language.

The official curricula in force in the Community of Valencian at all levels of non-university
education ensure that the history and culture of Valencia are taught.

h) to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to implement
those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party.

The Order of 16 August 1994 (DOGV (Official Gazette of the Valencian Community) no.
2,331, of 24 August), of the Regional Ministry of Culture, Education and Science regulates
the official administrative Valencian knowledge certificates, which are issued by the
Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of Valencian. It also regulates the approval and
validation of other equivalent qualifications or certificates.

In order to obtain the corresponding approval or validation, citizens must present a request
to the Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian Language, which belongs to
the Regional Ministry of Education, together with a stamped copy of the supporting
academic or administrative documents.

As regards the measures to improve the teacher training system, the Regional Ministry of
Education, with a view to updating the Valencian and foreign language knowledge
certificates to improve the implementation of bilingual education programmes applied in
educational centres in the Community of Valencia, published the Order of 5 October 2009,
regulating the Linguistic-Technical Training Plan in languages for non-university teachers
and the obtainment of the necessary administrative qualifications for the vehicular use of
languages at all levels of non-university education (DOGV (Official Gazette of Valencian
Community) no. 6,132, of 28 October).

Structure of the Training Plan :

581

i) to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the measures
taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing the teaching of
regional or minority languages and for drawing up periodic reports of their
findings, which will be made public.

Non-university education is monitored and supervised by the Service for Education in
Valencian of the Directorate General for Planning and Educational Centres of the Regional
Ministry of Education and the Education Inspectorate.

Valencian knowledge courses for adults are monitored and supervised by the Technical
Committee for Coordination and Monitoring of the promotion of knowledge of Valencian in
the adult population. This committee is formed by technical staff from different bodies
belonging to the Regional Ministry of Education and representatives from educational and
teacher training centres.

Each centre must determine the number of groups to teach the training programme in
question, as well as Valencian language preparation courses, taking into account the
expected demand based on attendance at courses in previous years and the availability
within the timetable of teachers at the centre qualified to teach Valencian.

The assignment of Valencian language teachers to Advanced Vocational Training centres
has enabled the organisation and cataloguing of courses to promote knowledge of

Every academic year, the Technical Coordination and Monitoring Committee issues a
monitoring report on the programme to promote knowledge of Valencian at Advanced
Vocational Training centres. This report is drafted by the Language Policy Department of
the Regional Ministry of Education and is submitted to the Directorate General for
Personnel, the Directorate General for Planning and Educational Centres and the
Education Inspectorate so that each administrative unit can take the appropriate measures
to ensure the correct functioning of the programme to promote knowledge of Valencian.

regional or minority language, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations
involving no extra expense for the persons concerned;

b) in civil proceedings:

paragraphs b and c above and any necessary use of interpreters and
translations does not involve extra expense for the persons concerned.
2. The Parties undertake:
a) not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State solely
because they are drafted in a regional or minority language; or
b) not to deny the validity, as between the parties, of legal documents drawn up

As regards the use of Valencian in judicial proceedings, Valencian and Spanish are the coofficial languages in the judicial sphere; hence, all citizens from the Community of Valencia
are free to express themselves in such matters in either language. As indicated previously,
the Regional Ministry of Education also organises many Valencian language courses to
provide Valencian language training for judicial staff, either directly or through collaboration
agreements, and specifically designed for these civil servants.

3. The Parties undertake to make available in the regional or minority languages the
most important statutory texts and those relating particularly to users of these
languages, unless they are otherwise provided.

The Valencian Government has translated into Valencian versions of the Spanish
Constitution, the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE), the Treaty of Lisbon,
the Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the
Consolidated Version of the Treaty of the European Union.

In 2008, the Valencian Government published a Valencian translation of the Basic Statute
of Public Employees, which was widely distributed among Valencian Government
employees.

A collaboration agreement has been signed between the General State Administration
(Official State Gazette - BOE) and the Valencian Government for the publication of laws,
royal decrees and organic laws in the Valencian language. The cost of translations from
Spanish to Valencian is financed on an equal basis by the Official State Gazette and the
Community of Valencia.

The supplement in Valencian contains the following:
a) Organic and ordinary laws.
b) Royal Decree-Laws.
c) Royal-Legislative Decrees.
d) Provisions determined by the Director General of the BOE (Official State Gazette).

Ministry of Culture

•

institutional printed material available to citizens in bilingual or co-official
language versions.

All the institutional printed resources of the Sub-Directorate General for State Archives are
available to citizens in bilingual or co-official language versions. It also provides exhibition
catalogues in the co-official language of the corresponding Autonomous Community.
These are either summaries or full text versions of these catalogues.

In terms of the museums managed by the Ministry of Culture, the only museum in an
Autonomous Community with an official language other than Spanish recognised in its
Statute of Autonomy is the González Martí Museum of Ceramics and Sumptuary Arts. This
Museum is committed to offering its visitors information in both languages. The following
publications are available in Valencian:
•

Museum Guidebook.

•

Folding information leaflet. In 2008, 5,000 copies were published in Valencian,
representing 14% of the total.

•

All temporary exhibition leaflets in Spanish and Valencian.

The Prado National Museum publishes annual maps of the museum in Spanish, in six
foreign languages and in Valencian (2,500 units).
The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS) also plans in 2010 to publish
information leaflets containing maps of the museum in the different co-official languages.

Last year, the Collective Catalogue of Spain's Bibliographic Heritage acquired a system for
managing the Catalogue database, consisting of a multilingual application capable of
managing access to information through the access points to bibliographic records in any
of the official languages of Spain. The system allows terminology to be introduced in any
of these languages and, provided the corresponding standardised relations have been
established, to obtain information including the equivalents in these languages. This will
enable what are known in library science as “multilingual authority files” to be established,
618

as well as thesauruses with the same characteristic. These functions may be used online
and in libraries where the application is installed.
•

exterior and interior signs in bilingual or co-official language versions.

All the signs in archives managed by the Ministry of Culture and situated in Autonomous
Communities with co-official languages are bilingual or in the co-official language.

publicity campaigns in bilingual or co-official language versions.

Reading Promotion Plan: This campaign is presented in Spanish and in the co-official
languages:

In 2006, an publicity campaign was launched on television and in cinemas, with a total
value of 2,500,000 euros. The text and dialogue was in Spanish and in the co-official
languages. “Reading Promotion Plan” T-shirts were also distributed in these co-official
languages.

Another publicity campaign was launched on television and in cinemas in 2007, valued at
2,400,000 euros, once again in Spanish and in the co-official languages. “Reading
Promotion Plan” T-shirts were distributed in these co-official languages.

619

In 2008 and 2009, the campaign was only carried out in Spanish. However, in 2008
“Reading Promotion Plan” T-shirts were produced in the co-official languages.

In 2010, the first calendar was published to promote the documentary resources of the
State Archives in the country’s co-official languages . The calendar includes references to
the days of the week and to the months of the year in the co-official languages.

The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía has carried out a bilingual publicity
campaign in the co-official languages, and accounted for 20% of its campaigns in 2009.
The new layout of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía’s collection,
inaugurated in May 2009, was advertised through a national radio campaign broadcast in
the Autonomous Communities with co-official languages in their own language.
•

Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages.

44% of all Ministry of Culture web pages have been translated into the co-official
languages, on average as far as the fourth navigation level. Documents available for
download are not translated.

Of all the services offered by the Ministry of Culture, the most interactive from the coofficial language standpoint is Pregunte: las bibliotecas responden (“Ask a Librarian”)
(http://www.pregunte.es/consulta/consulta.cmd), which allows all Internet users to pose
questions and request information online and receive answers from professional librarians
via e-mail within three days. Enquiries and information requests can be submitted in any of
Spain’s co-official languages, and requests are answered in the same language.

The web pages of digital library projects promoted and implemented by the Ministry of
Culture are translated into all the country’s co-official languages. The Virtual Library of
Bibliographic Heritage allows users to access information using multi-lingual headers
incorporating both contents descriptions and the names of authors or institutions in the
different languages of Spain.

This not only fosters cooperation among the different libraries in the Autonomous
Communities in the digitalisation of their resources but also enhances the visibility of all

620

the languages of Spain on the Internet and strengthens consultation through the use of all
these languages.

In terms of the Spanish Archives Portal (PARES), during the first six months of 2010 the
Ministry intends to approve an indexation rule to ensure that points of access to
documentary descriptions comply fully with multilingual requirements in relation to both the
names of individuals and companies and geographic toponyms, which will gradually be
modified and replaced by the corresponding authorities.

As regards the future, there are also plans to make the descriptions of archives available
in co-official languages. This challenge will be addressed very gradually, starting with the
descriptions of the archives, in particular in the Archive of the Crown of Aragon.

The services offered by the Ministry of Culture to public libraries include the Website
Generator Tool for Libraries. This tool allows librarians to develop their library web pages
without any linguistic limitations. This means that libraries in Autonomous Communities
with two official languages can offer their contents in both languages.

The sections corresponding to “Performing Arts” and “Music” on the Ministry’s web page,
as well as the web pages of creative artistic centres, contain directories available to users
in the co-official languages. The information on the new web pages of different creative
centres belonging to the National Institute of Performing Arts and Music (INAEM) will also
be available in these languages.

In 2009, the web pages of the museums managed by the Ministry of Culture began to
include the official co-official languages of the Autonomous Communities. In that year, the
index and static contents of the National Museum of Underwater Archaeology (ARQUA)
were translated. The Museo Colegio Nacional de San Gregorio museum in Valladolid and
the National Museum of Romanticism in Madrid will soon adapt their web pages. The aim
is to include these languages as other museums update their web pages.

The visitors’ channel available on the Prado Museum’s web page is translated into the coofficial languages, with the following contents: opening hours and tickets, groups, facilities
and recommendations, access and maps. The 15 masterpieces channel, with the contents

621

of the 15 selected masterpieces at the Museum, technical information and explanatory
texts, are also translated into the same languages.

44.5% of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía web page is available in the coofficial

languages.

Of

the

nine

sections

on

this

museum's

web

page

(www.museoreinasofia.es), four (“Visit”, “Museum”, “Collection” and “Library”) are available
to users in the State’s four co-official languages. The following information in each section
is available in these languages (expressed in percentages):
•

Visit: 66% (“Access and Transport”/”Ticket Prices”/”Visitor Services”/ “Venue Hire”)

•

Museum: 37.5% (“Mission Statement”/”Sponsors and Supporters”/”Friends of the
Museum”)

•

Collection: 12.5% (“Presentation”)

•

Library: 20% (“Presentation”)

The National Library (Biblioteca Nacional de España – BNE) redesigned its institutional
web page in May 2009. The new web page is designed as a single multilingual portal
allowing users to select the navigation language. This means that the portal’s structure is
the same in any language, thus ensuring that all the contents are shown in the official
language of Spain – Spanish – and in the co-official languages.

In this sense, in September 2009 the National Library awarded the company Linguaserve
Internacionalización de Servicios a contract to provide consultancy and development
services for the integration of the Global Business Connector (GBC) Translations Server.
The National Library also plans to set up a platform that will provide access to a translation
system integrated on its web page, thus allowing it to monitor all outstanding translation
work. This application will be launched automatically at regular intervals, and will detect
whether any contents in the web contents manager are waiting to be sent to the
Linguaserve Translations Server for translation. The system is expected to substantially
improve the time it takes to translate the contents of the National Library web page into all
the abovementioned languages, since the translations will be available in one or two days.
The system will be installed at the end of 2010.

The National Library also has a channel on YouTube on which all videos are transcribed
into the State’s different co-official languages.

requests received and answered in co-official languages.

In relation to replies issued in co-official languages, mention was already made in the
previous section of the web page “Pregunte: las bibliotecas responden” (Ask a Librarian),
where questions are answered in the language in which they are submitted.

The González Martí Museum of Ceramics and Sumptuary Art also replies in Valencian to
all forms submitted in that language.

Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages.

The Ministry’s web page (http://www.mpt.es) is available in the co-official languages, and
much of its contents have been translated into those languages. Great efforts have been
made in recent years to revise and translate the contents of the web page.
Given the huge volume of information available on the Ministry of Territorial Policy’s web
page, the decision was take to adapt the web page by navigation levels, starting with the
first levels since these are the most visible.
At present, the contents of the web page have been translated as far as the fourth
navigation level, and even additional levels in some sections. For now, “Latest News” has
been excluded since this information has to be published immediately and this immediacy
would be lost if it were necessary to wait for such news to be translated. Translating this
information at a later date has not been considered a priority because interest in such
news diminishes with time.
In short, it is estimated that at present more than 300 pages have been translated.

Contents publishers have access to an infrastructure that allows them to introduce
translations via a user-friendly interface, and they receive the translated texts that they
request for inclusion on the web page.

For the future, planned improvements in the publication environment include most notably
a project to implement a translations workflow that will facilitate the process for obtaining
translations and achieve greater involvement of publishers in the inclusion of these
translations.

This web page (http://www.mpt.es) has also been used to provide town and city councils
that receive funds under the State Fund for Local Investment with posters announcing
projects in co-official languages, as can be seen on the URL

624

http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html. These posters have
been reused for the State Fund for Employment and Local Sustainability.

The need for translated contents is being taken into account in the implementation of the
Ministry's electronic site. “Acceda” (Access), the basic application used on the electronic
site, has been adapted to enable forms used by citizens in electronic formalities and
procedures to be translated, and will also enable the inclusion of the different contents
translated into the co-official languages, as well as into other languages such as English
and French.
Spain’s linguistic diversity has also been taken into account in the work places of Ministry
employees. The Ministry’s Intranet (http://intranet.mpt.es) was designed based on this
criterion, with pages available in co-official language versions and the capacity to upload
translated contents into those work environments.

The Tax Office:

In relation to contents published in the co-official languages in Spain on the Tax Office’s
website (portal), the Agency’s linguistic policy focuses on ensuring each citizen is able to
communicate effectively in the co-official language of their choice. In this regard, the Tax
Office’s Internet portal is available in Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Valencian. Specific
information is also available in Basque.

Given the volume of information to be translated, translated versions of these pages are
gradually being incorporated. Users are therefore offered contents in Catalan, Galician and
Valencian and pages not yet available in those languages can be consulted in Spanish.
Nevertheless, the Tax Office undertakes to make improvements in this area. In any case, it
ensures that tax payers can use the co-official language in their respective Autonomous
Communities.

The translated contents range from all navigation levels, except “Latest News”, due to its
immediacy, and other exceptions that are not translated for technical reasons or specific
translation turnaround times, particularly in the case of PDF documents. In terms of the
translation of legal provisions, only those published and translated into the corresponding
co-official language in official gazettes are incorporated.

The Tax Office’s Internet portal offers two types of services: tax information and
personalised services. Tax Information services are offered in Spanish, Catalan, Valencian
and Galician. Only specific information is provided in Basque. Personalised Services are
offered in the user’s preferred language (Spanish, Catalan, Galician and Valencian)
whenever possible, and in Spanish when this is not possible.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural and Martine Affairs provides information in the coofficial languages in non-static format, and it also has a legislative database for consulting
the specific Autonomous Community regulations in languages other than Spanish.

A new web site project is also underway to achieve a more harmonised integration of the
contents corresponding to the departments of environment and rural and marine affairs.
This will include a new system to improve the adaptation of the web page for the use of coofficial languages, as well as English and French. Most publications issued by the Ministry
and its regional bodies are in Spanish. Of a total of 206 published titles, only 11 have been
published in other official languages.

Territorial Management Office of Valencia
Valencian language knowledge of personnel at the Territorial Management Office of
Valencia: 90% of all staff (17 persons) have a good understanding of Valencian, 30%
speak Valencian well and 60% speak it less well.

2. In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory the number of
residents who are users of regional or minority languages is such as to justify
the measures specified below, the Parties undertake to allow and/or encourage:

a) the use of regional or minority languages within the framework of the regional or
local authority;

647

b) the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to submit oral or
written applications in these languages;

c) the publication by regional authorities of their official documents also in the
relevant regional or minority languages;

d) the publication by local authorities of their official documents also in the relevant
regional or minority languages;

Article 6 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia establishes that the
Valencian Government shall ensure the normal and official use of Spanish and Valencian,
and shall adopt the necessary measures to promote its knowledge, adding that the law
shall establish the criteria applicable to the own language in the administration and
education.

The Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian establishes with respect to Valencian, as
the own language of the Community of Valencia, that all citizens shall have the right to
know and use that language orally and in writing in both private relations and in their
relations with the public authorities, adding that the use of Valencian by citizens in their
public and private relations shall have full legal effect.

The Valencian Government provides all legal texts and application and other forms in
bilingual format or in the language preferred by citizens.

Local entities publish in the Diari Oficial de la Comunitat Valenciana (Official Gazette of the
Autonomous Community of Valencia), which is bilingual, and in the respective official
gazettes of the province, which also have bilingual editions:
•

e) the use by regional authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in
their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s)
of the State;

In conformity with the provisions established in Article 1 of the Regulations of the
Valencian Parliament (Les Corts):
•

the two official languages are Valencian and Spanish

•

members may use either language.

•

the official publications of the Valencian Parliament shall be bilingual.

As regards simultaneous translation, both languages are fairly similar and therefore
relatively easy to understand, and given members’ knowledge of both languages, the use
of simultaneous translation is not necessary.

f) the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in their
assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the
State;

g) the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the official
language(s), of traditional or correct forms of place-names in regional or minority
languages.

The Valencian Language Academy (AVL) strives to guarantee the correct use of Valencian
in toponyms and encourages municipalities that have not yet adapted their names, in
either bilingual or monolingual form, to do so.

Most municipalities in the Valencian-speaking area have officially adopted only the
Valencian denomination, and a few have opted to use both languages (e.g.
Alicante/Alacant) and some maintain names in Spanish as the official language.
Municipalities in the Spanish-speaking area use official names in Spanish.

649

In 2007, the Valencian Language Academy launched a series of actions to encourage
Valencian-speaking municipalities with dual official names in Valencian-Spanish to choose
only the name in Valencian; 3 municipalities have started to change their names.
Information was also sent to the municipalities in the Spanish-speaking area with
Valencian names to encourage them to officially choose the Valencian version; 2 of the 96
municipalities have already initiated the modification procedure.

The Valencian Language Academy continues to publish a collection of booklets on
toponyms of Valencian municipalities, launched by the Valencian Government. These
booklets contain the municipal toponyms of each municipality and are published in cooperation with these municipalities. Fifty-six (56) booklets were published between 2006
and 2008.

3. With regard to public services provided by the administrative authorities or other
persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
regional or minority languages are used, in accordance with the situation of each
language and as far as this is reasonably possible:

a) to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used in the provision of the
service;

In order to increase knowledge of Valencian among public employees in the Administration
of the Valencian Government, language training courses are organised in work centres
and in other public institutions. Employees attend these courses during working hours. The
established levels are adapted to the qualifications awarded by the Regional Ministry of
Education: Level 1: Oral; Level 2: Elementary; Level 3: Intermediate; and Level 4:
Advanced. The numbers of courses and public employees who have attended these
courses are as follows:

a reply in these languages; or

c) to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a request in these
languages.

The entire Valencian Administration allows Valencian-speakers to use Valencian. For this
purpose, and in relation to new technologies, from the strictly administrative standpoint
and as far as the Valencian Government, its ministries, departments and dependent
entities are concerned, full access to the web page in Valencian is a priority objective, as
established in the Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencian, the Law on the
Use and Teaching of Valencian (Law 4/1983, of 23 November) and the specific directives
and law creating the Valencian Language Academy (Law 7/1998, of 16 September).

651

In this respect, the SIMAC (Integral and Multi-Channel Citizen Service System) project
establishes accessibility in Valencian to web pages owned or managed by the Valencian
Government as main quality/legal indicators. Specifically, the Valencian Government’s
new institutional portal (future electronic site) - www.gva.es -, which will be launched
shortly, complies fully with this requirement.

The Directorate General for Modernisation, which is the webmaster of the Valencian
Government’s institutional web page, supervises, controls, guides and promotes
bilingualism on all the web pages of departments, bodies and entities belonging to the
administration of the Council, ensuring the obligatory and correct presence of Valencian, in
order to guarantee the untainted institutional image, the recognised corporate reputation of
the Valencian Government and compliance with applicable legislation currently in force.

Through technological support agreements with local entities, the Valencian Government
is also providing advice on and promoting the inclusion of Valencian on these entities’ web
pages on equal terms with Spanish.

Furthermore, Article 16.1 of the Valencian Government Draft Bill on the Electronic
Administration for the Community of Valencian, work on which began at the beginning of
the current legislature and which is about to be examined by the Legal Consultative
Council for a mandatory ruling, in relation to the promotion of Valencian on public web
pages, establishes the following:

Article 16.Use of official languages, foreign languages and sign languages
1. The electronic sites owned by the entities listed in Articles 2.1 and 2.3 of this Law must
enable access in Valencian and Spanish to their contents and services, including the
integral processing of procedures, and must have standardised electronic documents
in both languages. This excludes contents integrated in those originating from external
electronic sites, provided that these are not obliged to offer them in both languages. If
there is any obligation, all citizens may demand either of the two sites to comply with
linguistic requirement regulated in this section.

In any case, the Council of the Valencian Government, in collaboration with the
Valencian Language Academy, shall promote and foster the effective implementation
652

of Valencian in all electronic sites, especially providing the necessary assistance to
allow citizens to exercise their right to relate validly and effectively in Valencian and
Spanish with any of the Public Administrations of the Valencian Community.

Similarly, the electronic sites may integrate or incorporate automated translation
systems or applications, duly indicating that the translations are automated and the
warnings in relation to specific translated content, its possible functional character and
the non-liability for copyright.

Mention must also be made of the following articles in the abovementioned draft law:

Article 6. Rights
In addition to the rights recognised in Article 6 of Law 11/2007, of 22 June, on electronic
access of citizens to public services, citizens will also have the rights indicated in the
following sections in the terms used in this law, and to fully and gradually exercise these
rights within the scope of the implementation of electronic services and relations:

The right to bilingualism in the official languages in the Community of Valencia.

Article 41. Electronic administration analysis and report
1. The approval or modification of any regulation governing administrative procedure or a
work process within the Administration shall require a prior electronic administration
analysis by the proposing body, which must contain at least the following aspects:
[…]
m) Compliance with the linguistic requirements established in sections 1 and 2 of
Article 16 of this Law.

4. With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3
accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the following
measures:

653

a) translation or interpretation as may be required

The technical language staff and advisors employed at the different Public Administrations
perform language training, guidance and promotion functions and also translate
documentation. The numbers of employees in these posts in the different Public
Administrations are as follows:

Some trade union and civil entities have full or part-time staff who work as language
experts. There are also companies and freelance workers who specialise in translation
and language services, although no register of such companies and workers is available.
b) recruitment and, where necessary, training of the officials and other public
service employees required;
c) compliance as far as possible with requests from public service employees
having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to be appointed in the
territory in which that language is used.

The Regional Centre of the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IEF) in Valencia provides training on
public finance for civil servants working for the Ministry of Finance and Economy in the
Valencian Community, in the Autonomous Community of the Balearic Islands, and also in
the Autonomous Community of Murcia.

Its regional headquarters are based in the city of Valencia. Since the Autonomous
Community of the Balearic Islands and the Community of Valencia have co-official
languages, the oral use of these languages is facilitated by staff who can communicate
with citizens in those languages.

654

In terms of measures for civil servants, the IEF has encouraged employees to attend
courses organised by the Valencian Institute of the Public Administration in order to pass
official exams. The courses are organised during working hours. The courses that have
been given using the classrooms of the IEF in Valencia are indicated in the following

Valencian language courses for adults are organised at the Regional Centre’s facilities in
classrooms offered free to entities that plan or teach courses.

Users of the Regional Centre’s Library have been attended in either co-official language of
the Community of Valencia whenever persons address staff at the centre in one of these
languages.

Knowledge of Valencian is taken into consideration when selecting candidates for
scholarships at the IEF Regional Centre Library.
3.3.5 Application of Article 11

655

1. The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority languages within
the territories in which those languages are spoken, according to the situation of
each language, to the extent that the public authorities, directly or indirectly, are
competent, have power or play a role in this field, and respecting the principle of
the independent and autonomy of the media:
a) to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service mission:
i) to ensure the creation of at least one radio station and one television channel in the
regional or minority languages; or

The Community of Valencia has two public radio stations: Ràdio Nou and Sí Ràdio. Almost
all their programmes are broadcast in Valencian. One of the two public television
broadcasters in the Autonomous Community, Punt Dos, broadcasts mainly in Valencian. A
large percentage of the programmes broadcast by the other television channel belonging
to RTVV, Canal 9, are in Valencian.

Since its creation in 1989, the RTVV group complies with the provisions established in the
Statute of Autonomy of the Community of Valencia, the Law on the Use and Teaching of
Valencian and the Law on the Creation of RTVV regarding linguistic standardisation and
the promotion of Valencian.

The RTVV group, through its entire offer of channels and media, has promoted the
Valencian language and culture and has also contributed decisively to the promotion of
reading. In accordance with Article 2 of the Law on the Creation of RTVV, the RTVV group
shall guarantee “a) the promotion and linguistic protection of the own language of the
Community of Valencian”, and shall also ensure “e) respect for political, cultural and
linguistic, religious and social pluralism”.

Canal 9 currently broadcasts 24 h mostly in Valencian; Punt 2 broadcasts 24 h per day in
Valencian; and the international channel, TVVi, also broadcasts 24 h mainly in Valencian.
In line with this committed support to broadcast programmes in Valencian, in February
2009 it launched the new news channel “24.9”, which broadcasts programmes, reports,
interviews and documentaries in Valencian that offer a broader view than pure news.

656

ii) to encourage the creation of at least one radio station and one television channel in the
regional or minority languages; or
iii) to make adequate provision so that broadcasters offer programmes in the regional or
minority languages;

The RTVV group uses all new media to broadcast its offer of audiovisual contents in
Valencian. Through the “Infonou” service, RTVV is able to offer the most important news
stories in Valencian via mobile telephone. The RTVV group also offers viewers the
opportunity to access TVVi through Orange on their mobile telephones and live on the
RTVV web page. The group’s web page also offers a videopodcast service for
downloading programmes in MP4 and Mobile 3G format.

To summarise, more and more programmes and contents are offered in Valencian each
year. There is also a greater variety of formats, programmes, contents and therefore
records available to citizens in Valencian. The work of the RTVV group in this area has
been recognised on numerous occasions, most recently exemplified by the “Escola
Valenciana” Prize for Standardisation and Use of Valencian, awarded by the comedy
programme “Socarrats” on 13 May.

b) i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station in the regional
or minority languages; or

Autonomous Community digital terrestrial television licensees in the Community of
Valencian are obliged to broadcast at least 25% of their broadcasting time or the highest
percentage that they have agreed in their technical offer submitted for the licence tender in
Valencian.

Local digital terrestrial television licensees have also undertaken to provide certain
percentages of broadcasting time in Valencian, starting at a minimum of 25%, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender procedure. This does not include
territories where Spanish is the main language.

The licensees broadcasting on VHF/FM are also obliged, according to their respective
contractual offers or undertakings, to broadcast in Valencian for a percentage of
broadcasting time; in the case of municipal broadcasters, this percentage cannot be less
657

than 50% of total broadcasting time, with the exception of territories where Spanish is the
dominant language.

In the last general tender called by the Valencian Government to award licences for the
management of the public commercial VHF/FM broadcasting service in the Community of
Valencia, in February 2007, the specific administrative terms and conditions included, as a
criterion for evaluating the different proposals, the use of Valencian in programmes. This
ensures compliance with Article 10 of Decree 38/1998, of 31 March, of the Council of the
Valencian Government, establishing the licensing system for VHF/FM broadcasters,
according to which, as established in the terms of the tender, preference would be given
specifically to the use of Valencian in programmes.

ii) to encourage and/or facilitate the broadcasting of radio programmes in the regional or
minority languages on a regular basis;

The programmes in Valencian offered by the RTVV group also include the radio stations
Radio 9 and Sí Radio, which broadcast entirely in Valencian, and the following web pages
in Valencian: www.rtvv.es, www.radionou.com, www.siradio.com, www.babalaclub.com.

c) i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television channel in the
regional or minority languages; or

The tender for licenses to broadcast two digital terrestrial television programmes in the
Autonomous Community of Valencia, awarded in 2006, established in Clause 7.14 of the
specific administrative terms and conditions, the obligation of the licensee to use
Valencian in each hourly programming slot at least twenty-five percent of the broadcasting
time. Broadcasting times in Valencian of more than 25% also received up to 25 points
during the assessment of bids.

The same rule was established in the specific administrative terms and conditions of the
tender to award licenses for the broadcasting of local digital terrestrial television channels,
also awarded in 2006.

658

In recent years, RTVV has increased substantially its audiovisual offer with the subsequent
increase in the number of hours broadcast in Valencian. Mention must also be made of the
increase in Valencian prime time on Canal 9, with great success in terms of viewing
figures, as shown by the monitoring of programmes such as “Alquería Blanca” and
“Socarrats”.

The following tables show data for programmes broadcast in Valencian (excluding the new
channel “24.9” and TVVi).

d) to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio and
audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

Article 10 of Law 1/2006, of 19 April, of the Valencian Government, on the Audiovisual
Sector, requires 20% of the annual air time of television broadcasters operating within the
area covered by the law to be devoted to the broadcasting of Valencian audiovisual works
and films, and stipulates that these should preferably be made in Valencian in the original
language version.

Article 8 of the Law, regulating public aid for the creation and production of films and
audiovisual works, also stipulates that the use of Valencian is one of the criteria taken into
account.

The agreements with Radiotelevisión Valenciana stipulate that the use of the Valencian
language is one of the criteria taken into consideration when awarding audiovisual
production contracts.

e) i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at least one
newspaper in the regional or minority languages; or

In its determination to encourage the use of Valencian in the media, particularly the printed
press, in its digital format, the Valencian Government has signed protocols of agreement
with the publishers of the main dailies in the Community of Valencia. Under the terms of
these agreements, the publishers agree to publish their respective web pages – the digital
editions of their respective newspapers – entirely in Valencian, in the same way as they
produce the Castilian version.

660

ii) to encourage and/or facilitate the publication of newspaper articles in the regional or
minority languages on a regular basis;

Almost all regional newspapers or regional editions of dailies regularly contain pages or

publications in percentage terms.

Periodical publications and radio programmes in Valencian
The first public aid programme of the Valencian Language Academy (AVL) was
announced in 2005 and was limited to local, municipal or specialist periodical publications.
Since 2006, the programme is also open to radio broadcasters.

The response to this programme is excellent and the amount assigned in the AVL’s budget
has increased substantially compared with the initial amount of 18,000 €.

ii) to apply the existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual productions in
the regional or minority languages;

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Regional Ministry of Education published the terms and
conditions of public aid programmes to subsidise audiovisual productions in Valencian.
These subsidies aim to provide financial support to companies in the audiovisual sector
and finance productions in Valencian. Specialised companies and production companies
in the audiovisual sector have participated in grant programmes and 121 productions have
been subsidised for a total amount of 728,645 €, distributed annually as follows:

The new type of public aid provided for in Article 8.3 or the law is aid to cover some of the
production costs of Valencian films, based on certain automatic objective criteria such as
box office success and takings during the prescribed release period. However, this aid
has not been allocated because the Decree required to implement the Law regulating this
aid has not yet been approved.

g) to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using regional or
minority languages.

Specific Valencian language courses are organised every year related with these media.
Every year the Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian Language organises
specific examinations to award official administrative certificates for the use of Valencian in
the media.
Every year the Regional Ministry of Education of the Community of Valencian organises
training courses in different specialist languages. The twenty-sixth edition of these courses
was held in 2009. All the programmes include a media language course. The participants
in the reference period were as follows:

2. The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language used in
identical or similar form to a regional or minority language, and not to oppose
the retransmission of radio and television broadcasts from neighbouring
countries in such a language. They further undertake to ensure that no
restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and free circulation of
information in the written press in a language used in identical or similar form to
a regional or minority language. The exercise of the above-mentioned freedoms,
since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such
formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial
integrity or public safety
for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for
the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing disclosure of
information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and
impartiality of the judiciary.

As regards the broadcasting of public television programmes from Catalonia in the
Community of Valencia, the Valencian Government has imposed penalties and closer
broadcasting centres in relation to programmes rebroadcast by a private Association
without the necessary administrative license, and independently of the mechanisms
established by Law for the reciprocal reception of public television signals from
neighbouring Autonomous Communities.

In accordance with legal provisions, the

Autonomous Communities concerned must conclude an agreement and the use of the
radio-electric frequencies for this purpose must be established by the competent state
body. Negotiations have also been held with the competent authorities in Catalonia to
reach an agreement to ensure reciprocal reception of the respective regional public
television programmes.
663

The European Commissioner for the Information Society and Media, in response to a
question in the European Parliament from a Euro MP from Convergència i Unió on this
issue, stated that “there is no evidence that Community Law is being breached” with the
closure of repeaters, adding that the Member States “may establish a licensing system in
order to efficiently manage the range of radiofrequencies.” Community law has not been
not breached because these are restrictions of a Spanish channel in Spanish territory.
3. The Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of the users of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into account within such bodies as
may be established in accordance with the law with responsibility for
guaranteeing the freedom and pluralism of the media.

These structures are not in place since the Audiovisual Council of the Community of
Valencian has not been created or regulated. There is only a general provision for its
creation in the Statute of Autonomy and in Law 1/2006, on the audiovisual sector.

Application of Article 12
With regard to cultural activities and facilities – especially libraries, video libraries,
cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as well as
literary work and film production, vernacular forms of cultural expression, festivals
and the culture industries, including inter alia the use of new technologies – the
Parties undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used and to the
extent that the public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this
field:

a) to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or minority
languages and foster the different means of access to works produced in these
languages;

This periodical is geared mainly to identifying and giving the highest possible profile to
books of artistic and cultural importance produced by Valencian publishing houses. A
selection of titles is reviewed by Valencian critics, and many of the books in question are in
the regional language.

5. Bibliographical Novelties Bulletin

The Bibliographical Novelties Bulletin is intended to help librarians working in the
Valencian Library System to purchase new works. This Bulletin comprises a section on
new publications in Valencian (http://dglb.cult.gva.es/Bibliotecas/bi-boletinbiblio_v.htm).
6. Web page of the Directorate General for Books and Libraries

666

The web page of the Directorate General for Books and Libraries can be consulted in both
Valencian and Spanish, including the DG’s own specific database (http://dglb.cult.gva.es/).
7. Publications

The Directorate General for Books, Archives and Libraries has a Publications Unit. The
department's publications policy is clearly focused on increasing publications in Valencian.

Special importance has been attached to the publication of the comic on Jaume I de Santi
Tena, as part of the activities to commemorate “Jaume I Year”, with the printing of 3,250
paperback copies and 250 hardback copies. This comic has been distributed among
schoolchildren who participated in the activities programmed for these celebrations and
has also been sent to Valencian public libraries.
Use of Valencian in the activities of Teatres de la Generalitat Valenciana
The web page run by the Valencian Government’s theatre department (Teatres de la
Generalitat Valenciana - TGV) (http://teatres.gva.es) is available to users in Spanish and
Valencian language versions. E-mails are answered in the language in which the user has
submitted his or her query.
All advertisements announcing plays and other performances, including posters and
information leaflets, are printed in Valencian. Programmes, which are treated as
publications to accompany performances rather than publicity material, are printed in the
language of the individual performance or show. Catalogues published by the TGV (for the
Dansa Valencia Festival and the Sagunt a Escena summer festival) are always bilingual.
Under the heading of “grants for theatrical performances”, the Community's System of
Grants for the Theatre and Circus Sectors takes account of works in the regional language
as one of the criteria for assessment.
Production
One of the specific functions of the TGV is to produce and co-produce performances with
other public and private bodies. In discharging this duty, it has expended major efforts to

667

promote Valencian, prioritising productions and co-productions in Valencian and in both
languages, although most have been presented solely in Valencian.
Programming
The TGV programmes drama and dance performances in five different theatres.

The TGV programmes performances by Valencian and other national companies.

The TGV programmes performances by companies performing solely in Valencian, others
in Spanish and also performance that can be seen in both languages.

Valencian Literature Day

The Valencian Language Academy conducts various activities to directly promote the
Valencian language. The most high-profile activity is Valencian Literature Day, celebrated
on 20 November each year, commemorating the date of publication of Tirant lo Blanch (20
November 1490), when an author is designated “Writer of the Year”. The first edition was
celebrated in 2004 and intended to familiarise the general public, and in particular
schoolchildren, with a Valencian writer in the context of his or her time.

An exhibition is organised around this date as the focal point of the whole celebrations.
This exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue and an educational guide for
schoolchildren. The opportunity is also taken to conduct other activities, such as publishing
the books written by (or about) the writer being honoured, the broadcasting on Valencian
television of a video about the writer (under an agreement signed between RTVV and the
Valencian Language Academy), which is also distributed in schools.

In the period 2006-2008, Manuel Sancis Guarner, the Castellon writers from the first third
of the 20th century and Jaume I were honoured, respectively.

The total investment in these activities for the period 2006-2008 exceeds 350,000 €.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following activities:

a) Promotion of the protection, dissemination and knowledge of co-official languages

In 2007, the Directorate General for Cultural Cooperation and Communication of the
Ministry of Culture announced competitive subsidies to finance the investment projects of
cultural institutions that promote the protection, dissemination and knowledge of the own
language of the Community of Valencia, up to a maximum amount of 1,000,000 €.

This aid will continue in 2009 through a nominative subsidy for Cultural Promotion and
Cooperation, in the amount of 300,000 € for the promotion of the Valencian language in
the Community of Valencia.

b) Promotion of Cinematographic and Audiovisual Production

Article 36 of Law 55/2007, of 28 December, on Cinema, establishes the following:

“In order to promote and protect the use of the co-official languages other than Spanish
in film and audiovisual production, promoting the cultural plurality of Spain and equal
opportunities of the own languages of each territory in audiovisual expression and
dissemination, a fund of aid or specific credits shall be established that shall be
transferred in their entirety to the competent Bodies of the Autonomous Communities
that shall manage them in accordance with their responsibilities. This State
contribution, based on the principle of co-responsibility, shall be assigned annually in
the General State Budgets and shall be used for the promotion, distribution, exhibition
and promotion of the Cinematographic and Audiovisual Industry in the aforementioned
languages”.

Additional Provision Six of the Law on Cinema, regulating agreements to promote
cinematographic and audiovisual production in co-official languages other than Spanish,
states as follows:

669

“Through such agreements, the Ministry of Culture shall determine the credits
envisaged in Article 36 of the Law, either annually equivalent to the total contributions
that the Community in question has assigned in the preceding year to support and
promote audiovisual production, distribution and promotion in a co-official language
other than Spanish. The allowance received by each Autonomous Community shall not
be more than 50% of the total aid received by audiovisual companies residing in the
Community from the Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las Artes Audiovisuales
(Cinematographic and Audiovisual Arts Institute - ICAA) in the preceding year.

Article 19.3 of Royal Decree 2062/2008, of 12 December, implementing Law 55/2007 on
Cinema, regulates Article 36 above.

The General State Budget for 2008 included 2,500,000 € in the budget of the
Cinematographic and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture for this
purpose. The amount of 167,000 € was transferred to the Community of Valencia.

The 2009 General State Budget allocated 10,500,000 € to the budget of the
Cinematographic and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture for this
purpose; the distribution of this amount is currently being arranged, and will be distributed
once the corresponding agreements have been approved and signed by the parties.

Independently of the provisions contained in the Law on Cinema, Royal Decree 526/2002,
of 14 December, established facilities for access to aid to finance feature films for
producers with films originally in a co-official language other than Spanish. This aid has
been granted since 2003 until the current date.

c) Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

All the activities developed by the Sub-Directorate General for the Promotion of Books,
Reading and Spanish Literature comply with the constitutional mandate according to which
the richness of the different languages of Spain is a cultural asset that will require special
respect and protection.

For this reason, in competitive grant programmes, the terms and conditions applicable to
requests indicate that they are open to all the country's co-official languages and that they
670

aim to foster private inter-communication between Spanish cultures. Representatives of
business associations or regional language Academies sometimes belong to the
evaluation committees:

-

Aid to non-profit-making companies and institutions that publish cultural periodicals
written in any co-official language of Spain. The purpose of this aid is to distribute free
cultural magazines in the different official languages of Spain in Spanish libraries and
cultural centres abroad. Annual subsidised publications include magazines published in
Catalan, Galician and Basque.

-

Aid to promote reading and the dissemination of Spanish literature, through activities
organised to promote common Spanish culture in both Spain and abroad through
congresses, seminars, etc., participation and organisation of commemorations and
centenary celebrations – especially in honour of writers -, promote reading and the use
of public libraries. Annual subsidised initiatives include activities developed in Catalan,
Galician and Basque.

-

Aid for the publication of literary works in any co-official language of Spain. This aid
programme subsidises publishing projects in the country’s co-official languages, works
of Spanish culture, of national and international projection, that help enrich our
common bibliographic heritage, with the dual purpose of increasing the resources of
public libraries in Spain and promoting and fostering cultural communication and
cohesion among the Autonomous Communities, creating common bibliographic
resources in all public libraries.

d) National Literature Prizes
Representatives of the respective co-official language academies participate in the
selection of the National Literature Prizes awarded by the Ministry of Culture. The terms
and conditions applicable to all the Prizes stipulate that works and authors in any of the
languages used in Spain can be nominated. Many of these Prizes have been awarded to
works written and authors writing in languages other than Spanish.
e) Promotion of Performing Arts and Music
In the period 2006-2008, the Directorate General for the National Institute of Performing
Arts and Music (INAEM) adopted a policy geared to stimulating expression in the regional
671

languages of Spain in its aid programmes for initiatives to promote, develop and conserve
theatres and circuses and theatre and circus communication.
This is established by the resolutions of the National Institute of Performing Arts and Music
of 26 December 2005, 26 February 2007 and 8 February 2008, under which aid is
awarded to programmes to promote, develop and conserve theatres and circuses and
theatre and circus communication in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.
In this sense, the established requirements for participating in the national theatre
promotion programme are more flexible if the theatre performances are only made in one
of the official languages other than Spanish. This flexibilisation consists in excluding two
compulsory requirements for other applicants: firstly, that planned tours must visit at least
three Autonomous Communities; and secondly, that at least 40% of performances must be
given outside the Autonomous Community in which the applicant has its registered office.

b) to foster the different means of access in other languages to works produced in
regional or minority languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;

Through the corresponding subsidy orders for 2006, 2007 and 2008, twenty (20) editions
of literary works by publishing companies have been translated from Valencian into
Spanish and one from Valencian into French.

c) to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced in other
languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation
and subtitling activities;

The Orders of 29 December 2005 and 9 January 2007, issued by the Regional Ministry of
Culture, Education and Sport, publicly notifying subsidies for 2006 and 2007, respectively,
for dubbing audiovisual productions in Valencian, as well as the Order of 28 February
2008, issued by the Regional Ministry of Education, publicly notifying aid for dubbing
audiovisual productions in Valencian in 2008, are geared to facilitating the translation and
publication of written works and audiovisual products in both directions between Valencian
and any other language.

672

The dubbing of documentaries, feature films, shorts, made-for-TV movies and other
audiovisual products has been facilitated.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following activities:

1. Translation of published works

The Ministry of Culture, through the Sub-Directorate General for the Promotion of Books,
Reading and Spanish Literature, provides annual grants for translation:

-

Aid for the translation and publication of literary or scientific works by Spanish authors
in any foreign language, written originally and published in any of the official languages
in Spain. This aid is geared to disseminating and promoting Spanish culture abroad. It
is open to any Spanish work written in any co-official language.

-

Aid for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain into other co-

673

official languages of Spain, originally written and published in any of the languages in
Spain. The objective is to disseminate and promote the different co-official languages
of Spanish culture in national territory. They are open to any Spanish work written in
any co-official language.

d) to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting cultural
activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for incorporating the
knowledge
and use of regional or minority languages and cultures in the undertakings which
they initiate or for which they provide backing;

The Valencian Government undertakes to promote and encourage the use of Valencian in
society. One of the aims here is to ensure that the different activities conducted by civic
and cultural associations, and the various community organisations and committees
organising festive and cultural events, use Valencian in the oral and written expressions
for which they are responsible. The following grants and prizes are provided to that end:

Annual public grants have financed the activities conducted by non-profit associations to
promote the use of Valencian. These associations, located throughout the Community of
Valencia, engage in different activities: sports, religious, festive, cultural and commercial
activities, activities with consumers, patients, retired people, etc.

The funds have been distributed as follows:

de la Vega de Valencia” [the oldest law court in Europe] as Intangible World Heritage, are
available to users in Spanish and Valencian.

Invitations to all types of cultural acts or events are always written in Spanish and
Valencian. All the printed material produced by museums managed by the Valencian
Government (brochures, leaflets, etc.) are written in the Community’s two official
languages.

The Sagunto Archaeological Museum has been collaborated with a private enterprise to
produce a bilingual edition of the guidebook to the museum. Panels, posters and signs in
general used at the museums are also bilingual.

Fundación de la Comunitat Valenciana “La Luz de las Imágenes”

The web page of “The Light of Images” Foundation (www.laluzdelasimagenes.com) is
available to users in both Spanish and Valencian. The Foundation responds to e-mails,
enquiries, suggestions and complaints on the organisation of its exhibitions in the
language used by the person making the enquiry.

The material normally used by the Foundation to publicise cultural activities, for example
posters, billboards, advertisements in the media, leaflets, etc. is produced either in
Valencian only or in both Valencian and Spanish.

Exhibition guidebooks, manual leaflets, educational guides for schools are always
bilingual.

The articles included in the Foundation’s exhibition catalogue are published in the
language chosen by the author of the text in question.

The information and audiovisual panels accompanying exhibitions of collections are
published in Valencian and Spanish.

The Foundation’s corporate image (logo) is also presented in Valencian (image + la llum
de les imatges).
675

Jaume II El Just Foundation
Valencian is used in all documentary or promotional material accompanying all the cultural
activities organised at the Real Monasterio de Santa María de la Valldigna monastery by
the Fundació de la Comunitat Valenciana Jaume II el Just (Jaume II El Just Foundation).
Exhibitions presented in Valencian are accompanied by leaflets with the explanations in
Spanish for non-Spanish speakers.

Guidebooks in Valencian, Spanish, English and French are available to visitors to the
Monastery. PDAs or the system of guided visits to the Monastery allow visitors to choose
the language (Spanish and Valencian) in which they wish to receive the information (there
are plans to add English and French in 2009).

All the activities developed by the Foundation related with the Any Jaume I (Jaume I Year)
including the corresponding publications, namely leaflets, exhibition catalogues,
invitations, etc., have been produced in both Valencian and Spanish, allowing visitors or
participants to choose their preferred language.

The Foundation has organised music activities with the Valencian Music Institute (Institut
Valencià de la Música - IVM) at the Santa María de la Valldigna Monastery in July 2008.

The leaflets, advertisements and invitations are produced only in Valencian. As a general
rule, the Foundation always published material in Spanish and Valencian, separately or in
bilingual form.
Institut Valencià de la Música (Valencian Music Institute - IVM)

The Valencian Music Institute (IVM) uses Valencian in all its public communications in
daily relations with citizens. In addition to direct relations with the public, which are always
carried out in the user’s language, and correspondence or enquiries by e-mail received by
the IVM, which are also answered in the language in which they are received, the Institute
also develops the following initiatives:

Publications
676

1) Books:
The IVM publishes books in both Valencian and Spanish, according to the author’s
chosen language.
2) Albums:
The Valencian Music Heritage record collection includes texts in Valencian, Spanish
and English. Valencia is treated as the main language.
3) Music scores:
The music scores that the IVM co-publishes with the publishing houses Piles or Tritó
are always accompanied by comments in Valencian and Spanish. In the Compositors
Valencians collection, shared with Tritó, Valencian is the main language.

Other activities:
•

Web page:
All the fixed contents on the web page are available in Valencian and Spanish.

•

Printed programmes
The vast majority of printed programmes of concerts and festivals organised by the
IVM are bilingual, in Spanish and Valencian. Some are published exclusively in
Valencian.

•

Publicity
Depending on the area in which the action is being carried out and the type of publicity,
the IVM makes alternate use of Valencian or Spanish in its promotional campaigns.

Radiotelevisión Valenciana (RTVV)

One example of the crucial role developed by RTVV (Valencian Public Radio and
Television Broadcasting Company) to support the Valencian language is the backing it has
given since May 2006 to the Leer en valenciano (“Read in Valencian”) campaign,
coordinated by the Bromera Foundation and which was launched through the dailies
Levante-EMV and El Mundo in the last two campaigns. This campaign is geared to
encouraging reading, promoting the Valencian language and promoting the best Valencian
authors. RTVV was actively involved in this initiative and collaborated with various sectors
of society (public institutions, media, universities, all political organisations, the four main
business organisations and various social organisations, the Book Association and the
Valencian Librarians’ Association) to promote reading in Valencian.

677

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following activities:

1. Dissemination of information on web pages

The web pages of the Ministry of Culture, the National Library and the Museo Nacional
Centro de Arte Reina Sofía provide information in the country’s co-official languages
(Catalan, Galician and Basque), thus fostering plurilinguism when promoting their cultural
programmes.

The National Library also has a channel on YouTube on which all videos are transcribed
into the State’s different co-official languages.

2. Dissemination of information through other informative material

In the temporary exhibitions organised by the Ministry of Culture, through the
Subdirectorate General for the Promotion of Fine Arts, in national museums managed
exclusively by the Ministry in Autonomous Communities with co-official languages, room
information (information plaques, explanatory texts, etc.) and material to promote the
exhibition (brochures, posters, newspaper advertisements, etc.) are produced in the two
official languages of the Autonomous Community.

In other exhibitions staged in Autonomous Communities with co-official languages in which
the Subdirectorate General for the Promotion of Fine Arts collaborates with other
institutions, both languages are also normally used in exhibition material.

The Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute (IPCE), in addition to translating the main contents
of its web page, will also adopt this multilingual approach by gradually translating some of
the publications in the its Publishing Programme over the coming years.

2006-2008 budget of the Ministry of Culture for promoting culture in co-official languages.

Competitive grants to promote reading and Spanish literature, awarded to Autonomous
Communities with co-official languages. Historical statistics of these grants were not
broken down according to the language in which the reading promotion campaign was
carried out. They do, however, provide information for each Autonomous Community
678

receiving such aid. It may be assumed that most campaigns in Autonomous Communities
with a second official language are carried out in the co-official language. From 2010
forward, the data corresponding to the language used in the subsidised project will be
gathered and analysed.

e) to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or
supporting cultural activities have at their disposal staff who have a full
command of the regional or minority language concerned, as well as of the
language(s) of the rest of the population;

Most employees of cultural organisations know Valencian.
Information is provided below on the main bodies of the Valencian Government related
with culture:

Teatres de la Generalitat
Around 70% of the employees at the Teatres de la Generalitat Valenciana (TGV) speak

679

All staff (100 persons including the Cor de la Generalitat Valenciana (Valencia Regional
Government Choir) at the Valencian Music Institute, which belongs to the Regional
Ministry of Culture, Education and Sport, speak Valencian. Personnel dealing directly with
the public are also legally obliged to answer in Valencian if this language is used.

Audiovisual and Cinematographic Institute of Valencia (Institut Valencià de l’Audiovisual i

regional or minority language in providing facilities and planning cultural
activities;

Teatres de la Generalitat
Decisions on the programme of cultural activities of the TGV are governed by a Board of
Directors, which is responsible for defining the institution’s activities and approving its
action plans. The Board’s meetings are conducted in the habitual language of each

The Valencian Government announced financial aid for the dubbing of audiovisual
productions in Valencian.
Aid has also been announced for small and medium-sized companies in the audiovisual
sector of the Community of Valencian to promote Valencian audiovisual production
through the production of TV movies and television series.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following actions:
1. Deposit of published works
The National Library is the depositary of works published in any language in Spain.
2. Reference collections
The National Library has reference collections on different subjects in all the country’s coofficial languages .
2. In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority
languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of
a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or provide
appropriate cultural activities and facilities in accordance with the preceding
paragraph.

In 2007, a scaled-down version of the exhibition devoted to Castellon writers from the first
third of the 20th century, organised by the Valencian Language Academy (AVL), was held
at the Library of Catalonia. An abbreviated version of the catalogue was produced
specially for the exhibition.

3. The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing their cultural
policy abroad, for regional and minority languages and the cultures they reflect.

Exhibition in Brussels

The Regional Ministry of Culture, Education and Sport, coinciding with the celebration of
Community of Valencia Week in Brussels, between 10 and 17 October 2006, organised
the exhibition “Els escriptors valencians de l’edat moderna, ara” (“Valencian writers in the
Modern Era”), which opened to the public in the Belgian capital on 26 September,
682

European Languages Day, and closed on 31 October. This exhibition, a scaled-down
version of the one organised by the Valencian Language Academy in 2004, offered an
exceptional perspective for understanding, among many other things, the situation of the
Valencian language in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, a period in which the two official
languages of the Community of Valencia began to coexist: Valencian and Spanish.

Through a small but important collection of verses and works by authors such as
Timoneda, Beuter, Aierdi, Morlà, Planells or Galiana, translated into German, English,
French, Dutch and Spanish, Valencian literature reached other peoples and cultures, and
helped promote the Community of Valencia’s image of cultural diversity. A 16-minute
audiovisual was also produced in Valencian subtitled in five languages: Spanish, English,
French, German and Dutch.

The Valencian Language Academy (AVL) grants subsidies for the dissemination and
promotion of Valencian in Valencian centres abroad. In 2006, subsidies were granted for
Valencian language courses organised in centres in Argentina and Uruguay.

The directors of these centres asked the AVL to organise qualifying examinations for
students completing these Valencian language courses.

The President of the

Valencian Language Academy has forwarded the agreement of the Academy’s
Governing Board requesting the holding of examinations for the award of the official
certificates issued by the Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian
Language, a subsidiary body of the Department of Culture, Education and Sport
responsible for issuing administrative certificates on knowledge of the Valencian
language.

Further to the AVL’s request for examinations in the framework of activities disseminating
and promoting Valencian in Valencian centres abroad, the resolutions adopted by the
President of the Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian Language were
published in the Official Gazette of the Valencian Community, and extraordinary
examinations were organised for the award of official Valencian language certificates in
the cities of Rosario and San Juan in Argentina and Montevideo in Uruguay

As part of the policy to promote the representation of the Community of Valencian in the
European Union and at the request of the Autonomous Community’s Secretariat on
683

Relations with the European Union and Development Co-operation, the Valencian
Government decided to organise qualifying examinations as part of its activities to
disseminate and promote Valencian in Valencian centres abroad. In 2006, 2007 and 2008,
these examinations were organised under resolutions adopted by the Autonomous
Community’s Secretariat on Culture and Language Policy

(2006) and the Valencian

Secretariat for Education (2007 and 2008), in Brussels (Belgium).

The Regional Ministry of Education organises courses to promote knowledge of Valencian
outside the territorial area of the Community of Valencia in order to make this training
accessible to citizens living outside the Community. Courses are organised every year in
Brussels and the Qualifying Committee on Knowledge of the Valencian Language has
organised examinations for the different official levels of knowledge of Valencian.

Valencian centres abroad

This is the Valencian Language Academy’s oldest aid programme (2002). The programme
is aimed at Valencian centres abroad and consists of two types of grants: grants for
purchasing books and CDs in Valencian; and grants for language courses abroad.

As the Valencian centres have gradually created good libraries, with some centres no
boasting more than 300 titles in Valencian, the grants have been used more and more for
organising courses.

In the period 2006-2008, these grants were used to organise 24 courses in five centres
abroad: San Juan (6), Rosario (6), Cordoba (4) and Bahía Blanca (2) in Argentina; and
Montevideo (6) in Uruguay. 1,634 books and 70 CDs were also purchased.

Ministry of Culture:

1. Book fairs and the sending book consignments to cultural centres

At international book fairs where Spain either runs a national stand or instructs its
Embassies to do so, the new publications on display include books and periodicals in all
the languages used in Spain, some of them deriving from the grants allocated to book and
magazine publishers. The same applies to the book consignments sent to libraries and
cultural centres.

Spanish authors participate in international book fairs, congresses, etc. regardless of the
co-official language in which they write.

Application of Article 13
1. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, within the
whole country:

a) to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or limiting without
justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority languages in documents
relating to economic or social life, particularly contracts of employment, and in
technical documents such as instructions for the use of products or
installations;
b) to prohibit the insertion in internal regulations of companies and private
documents of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of regional or minority
languages, at least between users of the same language;

c) to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or minority
languages in connection with economic or social activities;

As regards provisions prohibiting, limiting or discouraging the use of Valencian for
economic and social activities, it should be mentioned that the use of Valencian within the
boundaries of the Community of Valencia is not limited by regulation. On the contrary,
Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 17 of the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian stipulate
685

that no citizens of the Community of Valencia may suffer discrimination on the
grounds of using Valencian in their public or private relations. They also have the
right

to

carry

out

their professional, business, labour, trade union, religious,

recreational and artistic activities in Valencian.

d) to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority languages by means
other than those specified in the above sub-paragraphs.

Article 16 of the Law on the Teaching and Use of Valencian stipulates that:
“Public enterprises, as well as public services or services directly dependent on the
Administration, must ensure that their employees working in direct contact with the
public have adequate and proper knowledge of Valencian in order to carry out their
assigned duties.”

Data on the use and command of Valencian by public employees were already presented
in the third report in the section on “Article 10. Administrative authorities and public
services.”

However, there are no records of complaints regarding the use of Valencian by employees
dealing directly with the public in public enterprises and public services reporting directly to
the Administration.

Article 16 of Valencian Government Draft Bill on Electronic Government in the Community
of Valencia, referred to in the abovementioned section of the report, is currently being
debated in the Valencian Parliament (Les Corts).

Nevertheless, the Valencian Government’s Internet portal now allows citizens to select the
language in which they wish to carry out administrative procedures and all documentation
is available in both official languages.

In these years, specific campaigns have been organised to promote the normal use of
Valencian in economic and social activities.

Promotion of Valencian on private web pages.
As regards the promotion of the use of Valencian on web pages owned by individuals or
companies with registered offices, residence or assets in the Community of Valencian, the
future Valencian Government Law regulating the right of access and the new technologies
system, and the promotion of the Knowledge Society in the Community of Valencian
(currently in the draft stage) also envisages that, periodically and within the pluri-annual
strategic planning in these areas, the Ministry will award grants or subsidies to improve the
linguistic accessibility of web pages in the Community of Valencia, mainly belonging to
SMEs and civil society or third sector organisations in our Community.

2. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, in so far as
the public authorities are competent, within the territory in which the regional or
minority languages are used, and as far as this is reasonably possible:

a) to include in their financial and banking regulations provisions which allow, by
means of procedures compatible with commercial practice, the use of regional or
687

minority languages in drawing up payment orders (cheques, drafts, etc.) or other
financial documents, or, where appropriate, to ensure the implementation of
such provisions;

b) in the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public sector), to
organise activities to promote the use of regional or minority languages;

Certain entities receive annual subsidies to promote the Valencian language. These
include the following trade unions: Confederación Sindical de CCOO PV, Unión General
de Trabajadores PV, Unión Sindical Obrera de la CV, Central Independiente y de
Funcionarios CSI-CSIF, Confederación General del Trabajo CGT-PV and Federación de
Sindicatos STPV-IV, ANPE.

Other subsidised entities and collectives include the following: Europa Press, Colegio
Notarial de Valencia, Colegio de Registradores de la Propiedad y Mercantiles CV,
Asociación de Jóvenes Empresarios de Valencia and Federación Empresarial de
Hostelería de Valencia.

In relation to economic and social activities, public enterprises, as provided in Article 16 of
the Law on the Use and Teaching of Valencian, must ensure that their employees working
in direct contact with the public have adequate knowledge of Valencian in order to carry
out their assigned duties.

c) to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes and
hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in their own language
persons using a regional or minority language who are in need of care on
grounds of ill-health, old age or for other reasons;

d) to ensure by appropriate means that safety instructions are also drawn up in
regional or minority languages;

Most safety instructions are in Valencian, in particular in Public Administration centres.
e) to arrange for information provided by the competent public authorities
concerning the rights of consumers to be made available in regional or minority
languages.
688

The following documents on consumers’ rights have been published in Valencian and
have been translated by the Valencian Government’s Language Policy Department:
•

Universal Declaration of the Rights of Users of Banking and Financial Services.

Educating in Valencian to promote the efficient use of ICTs
The “Internauta” project, developed by the Department of Justice and Public
Administrations, through the Directorate General for Modernisation, is geared to promoting
the capacity-building, training and normal, general and intelligent use of Internet through
attendance-based or on-line courses, with special focus on collectives most at risk from
digital exclusion (immigrants, unemployed persons, disabled persons, persons aged over
65, etc.). It also provides grants for the acquisition of ICT equipment and services
(basically computers or Internet access) for students who request them after successfully
completing the courses (the “Internauta” cheque).

The Internauta Project was launched on 25 October 2005 and since then more and more
students have participated in each edition, undoubtedly helping to significantly increase
the level of Internet access among Valencian citizens, both directly and having a knock-on
effect: almost 1 of every 2 new Internet users has in someway benefited from the
promotion and support afforded by the “Internauta” programme and similar Valencian
Government initiatives.

The success achieved with this initiative prompted the European Commission to select the
project in 2007 as a best practice for avoiding the digital gap, within the scope of the
European project “i-Afiel”, on innovative approaches for total inclusion in e-learning, and of
which the Valencian Government is the lead partner.

Between 2006 a 2008, 39,100 students received training under the Internauta project in
Valencian.

Google in Valencian

690

Another strategic and emblematic initiative undertaken by the Valencian Government to
promote Valencian internationally is geared to achieving its effective presence on popular,
widely-used web pages.

In this sense, since late 2008 the Valencian Government has been working with Google to
ensure that this website offers its functions and access in Valencian.

To achieve this, the first objective reached consisted in achieving international legal
recognition of Valencian as the own language of the Community of Valencian, treated and
considered on equal terms with Spanish (the official language in the whole of Spain),
Galician, Basque and Catalan.

The second objective that has been achieved, in addition to the abovementioned
transfrontier legal recognition, has been the contribution of evidence of the social and
cultural recognition of Valencian through specific references to same and its differentiated
use, on foreign web pages, mainly institutional sites, such as the European Union web
page.

All this suggests that shortly the entire international community will be able to access
Google in Valencian, recognising it as the own language of the Community of Valencia.
After Google, the aim is to also incorporate Valencian in other similar or general
commonly-used web pages.
Application of Article 14

The Parties undertake to:
a) to apply existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements which bind them with
the States in which the same language is used in identical or similar form, or if
necessary to seek to conclude such agreements, in such a way as to foster
contacts between the users of the same language in the States concerned in the
fields of culture, education, information, vocational training and permanent
education;
b) for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or promote cooperation across borders, in particular between regional or local authorities in
whose territory the same language is used in identical or similar form.
691

All the information on Valencian centres abroad can be found at the following specific web
page:
http://www.cevex.gva.es/index.php/ca
Courses in Yecla and the study of toponyms in El Carche (Region of Murcia)
These are Valencian language courses held in Yecla (Region of Murcia). In response to a
request from Yecla Council, a Valencian language course was organised in this Murcian
municipality in 2005. It is important to remember that Yecla, together with Jumilla and
Abanilla, are three municipalities in Murcia that belong to the district of El Carche, which
has various Valencian-speaking population groups. This venture is an example of cooperation between the Community of Valencian and the Region of Murcia geared to
maintaining Valencian in municipalities with Valencian-speaking minorities.

No other specific agreements have been signed to support the interests of the Valencian
language.

Regulation (EC) No 1082/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July
2006, permits the creation of European groupings of territorial cooperation (EGTCs) within
the European Union, and in order, through these EGTCs, to facilitate and promote crossborder, transnational and/or interregional cooperation between its members, solely for the
purpose of strengthening economic and social cohesion.

With this initiative, the European Union goes beyond the classic concept of cross-border
cooperation, which is understood to exist between neighbours, and opens a new channel
for “territorial co-operation”, in which states or regions which do not necessarily border
each other, can reach agreements which benefit common economic and cultural interests,
which may include, whenever necessary and if decided by its members, linguistic
interests.

In this area, Article 9.2 of the abovementioned Regulation, whose effective implementation
is guaranteed in Spain by Decree 37/2008, of 18 January, establishes, among the
elements that must necessarily be included in the Statutes of an EGTC, “the working
language or languages”.

692

Thus, in the case of EGCTs in which the Community of Valencia or regional local entities
may participate, as well as Public Law entities, Valencian may be included as one of the
working languages of the Grouping concerned.

693

3.4. BASQUE (BASQUE COUNTRY AND NAVARRE)

3.4.1. BASQUE COUNTRY

INTRODUCTION

The last evaluation by the Committee of Experts approved by the Committee of Ministers
of the Council of Europe defines the main short-term linguistic challenges. Thus, the report
approved by that Committee in December 2008 highlights the main positive valuations,
concerns and challenges resulting from the information compiled by the experts during
2007.

The abovementioned report by the Committee of Experts, approved in December 2008,
refers, with respect to the bodies belonging to the Basque Government, to the complaints
received regarding the health service (Osakidetza) and the autonomous community police
force (Ertzaintza), which concerned the aforementioned Committee, as “the staff lack the
necessary linguistic proficiency in Basque". In the case of the former, the experts
highlighted “difficulties” of patients “to be received and treated” in Basque. Recruitment
organised in this Health Service (Osakidetza) did not include Basque as a requirement
until 2006. In 2006, Basque was a compulsory language for 20% of the 3,000 posts
offered. The Committee stated that it was aware “of the practical difficulties faced by the
[Basque] authorities" to implement the undertakings regarding bilingual attention,
“commends the efforts made" and "understands that there is need to improve the current
situation", and at the same time "urges the authorities to continue their efforts to improve
the current situation”.

The Basque Government states that efforts are being made to improve the situation, and
improvements are being achieved, although a fully bilingual service has yet to be achieved
and this requires the adoption of efficient measures.

The Council of Europe also reminds the Basque institutions of the need to implement
existing legislation in certain areas of action, and encourages them to do so. Specifically,
the Council of Europe referred to the need to approve “decrees” to implement legislation,
such as Law 6/2003 on the status of consumers and users, in the following terms: “The

694

Committee of Experts urges the Basque authorities to adopt the corresponding decree to
implement the existing legal framework”.

The Basque Government also states that it has complied with this Council of Europe
recommendation through Decree 123/2008, on the linguistic rights of consumers and
users.

The Committee of Experts also highlighted the significant increase in aid granted to the
media in Basque. It is worthwhile recalling that in the previous report the only
recommendation made in relation to the media in the Basque language consisted precisely
in promoting the presence of Basque in the private electronic media. In this regard, the
Basque Government indicates that in the period 2005-2008 aid granted to the electronic
media increased by 119%, while the number of projects presented in the same period was
practically the same: 26 projects in 2005 and 25 in 2008.

Also, the previous report dated December 2008 included the following recommendations
of the Committee of Experts:
3. Promote cooperation across borders between communities in whose territory the
same language is used (in the case of Basque, between the Autonomous Community
of the Basque Country, the “Foral” Community of Navarre and the French Basque
Country situated in the French department council of Pyrénées Atlantiques).
4. The appropriateness of establishing “close cooperation” between the Autonomous
Community of the Basque Country and the “Foral” Community of Navarre in linguistic
matters, especially in the area of media and education.

With respect to the foregoing, the Council of Europe highlighted the relationship that is
being forged between the Basque Government and the Navarre Government with the
Basque language as the cornerstone element.

The Council of Europe also praised the collaboration agreement between the Basque
Government and the Public Office of the Basque Language, as well as the financial aid
programme launched by the Basque Government aimed at private organisations in France
that work to promote the use of Basque. This aid programme is managed within the scope
695

of the aforementioned collaboration agreement, an agreement which also promotes
cooperation in the areas of Euskaldunización (Basquisation) in the adult population,
toponymy, terminology and sociolinguistic research.

Finally, it is worthwhile recalling, regarding the sociolinguistic status of Basque in the
Basque Country, that the east of Gipuzkoa and Vizcaya are the areas with the highest
percentages of bilinguals, while the areas with the lowest percentages of bilinguals are
Álava and the western part of Vizcaya.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 8. EDUCATION

Paragraph 1. With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
such languages are used, according to the situation of each of these languages, and
without prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of the State:

Measures, paragraph 1:

sub-paragraph a)
i): to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or minority languages;

The measures indicated in sub-paragraph a, i) have been substantially complied with since
1983-84.
Following the proclamation of Basque as an official language, a series of education-related
linguistic rights were recognised by Basic Law 10/1982 on normalisation of the use of
Basque.

Article 5.2.b) recognises the right to be educated in both official languages as a
fundamental linguistic right.
Chapter 2 of Part 2 regulates the use of Basque in education (Articles 15 to 21). In
education up to the beginning of university studies, teaching of the official language that
has not been chosen for one’s education is compulsory.

696

The Government shall adopt measures to ensure that pupils have a genuine opportunity,
all else being equal, to obtain an adequate practical knowledge of both official languages
by the end of their compulsory schooling.
•

Law 1/1993, of 19 February, on Basque Public Schools (BOPV 25-2-1993).

Article 3.2.g) states that the aims of Basque public schools include guaranteeing that all
pupils, all else being equal, will possess practical knowledge of both official languages by
the end of their compulsory schooling, thus encouraging the use of the language and
contributing towards

its normalisation.
The 10th Additional Provision defines the linguistic models applying throughout the public
and private education system:
•

Model A, in which the curriculum will basically be taught in Spanish, with certain

activities or topics possibly being taught in Basque.
•

Model B, in which the curriculum will be taught in Basque and Spanish.

•

Model D, in which the curriculum will be taught in Basque, with Spanish as a

subject.
In the three models, Spanish language and literature, Basque language and literature and
odern languages will be taught primarily in the respective languages.

Model D currently predominates in pre-school education. The chart below shows the trend
in enrolments in pre-school education by education model from 1983-84 to 2007-08 (%):

This provision has been increasingly complied with. Teaching given basically in Basque
(Model D) amounted to the following percentages in 2008-09 – data corresponding to
enrolments in September:

Proportion of education given entirely in Basque (Model D):
Compulsory secondary education
Baccalaureate

52.79%

50.50%

To this must be added the proportion of education given partly in Basque (Model B):
Compulsory secondary education
Baccalaureate

27.07%

1.51%

From the foregoing, it follows that the figure for secondary education in Basque exceeds
that in Spanish. The chart below shows the trend in enrolments in compulsory secondary
education by educational model from 2003-04 to 2008-09:

sub-paragraph e), iii) if, by reason of the role of the State in relation to higher education
institutions, sub-paragraphs i and ii cannot be applied, to encourage and/or allow the
provision of university or other forms of higher education in regional or minority languages
or of facilities for the study of these languages as university of higher education subjects;

The measures concerned have been put progressively into effect since the creation of the
Public University of the Basque Country (Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea - UPV/EHU) in
1981. The consequences of the declaration of the official status of Basque specifically
within the university sphere have been incorporated in the Statutes of the University of the
Basque Country, where the University’s official languages are declared to be Basque and
Spanish. The University has undertaken to safeguard and normalise the use of both
languages in its field of activity.

The Statutes have thus established the linguistic rights of members of the University in all
areas of university life. However, since the aforementioned rights cannot be guaranteed to
701

take effect immediately, the Statutes actually reflect this situation. Hence, Article 244
states that in teaching, research and university services the normalisation of Basque shall
be progressive and dependent on the necessary planning, in which a series of measures
must be taken in order to achieve the set objectives, as well as the resources necessary
for that purpose.

Law 19/1998, of 29 June, on University Planning in the Autonomous Community of the
Basque Country was published in the Official Gazette of the Basque Country (BOPV) on
16 July 1998. This law regulates certain important aspects of linguistic normalisation. The
relevant provisions are set out below.

Article 5 states:
1.- The Public University shall adopt suitable measures for normalisation of the
use of Euskera in university teaching, scientific research and administrative
and service activity, under conditions of equality and quality, with due heed
being paid at all times to the criterion that the University of the Basque
Country/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea must not be split up on exclusively
linguistic grounds.
2.- The

Public

University

shall

draw

up

'euskaldunización'

[Basquisation]

programmes for the various qualifications, which will be included in the
University Plan and financed out of programme contracts.
3.- “Euskaldunización” programmes must be based on the following criteria:
a) Adaptation of the supply of university studies in Euskera to demand from pupils.
b) Determination of the number of students needed to open or maintain education
courses in Euskera, the qualifications awarded, the subjects covered in
“euskaldunización” and whether these subjects are core, compulsory or optional.
c) The existence of qualified teaching staff and projected requirements.
4.- Administrative and service staff of the Public University will be covered by the
provisions for workers in the service of Public Administrations of Basic Law
10/1982, of 24 November 1982, on Normalisation of the Use of Basque.

40% of students currently enrolled at the Public University study in Basque (2008/09
academic year). Latest enrolments reveal that 45% of pupils opted to pursue their students
in Basque.

702

Below is a chart setting out the language choices made by students of the Public
University of the Basque Country (EHU) and the relevant changes in recent years. In spite
of the decrease in total enrolments, the number of students studying in Basque continues
to increase.

Because of this, the Public University of the Basque Country will have to make the process

moment there is no guarantee that students can pursue their studies in Basque even if
they wish.

The following are the main objectives of the language policy adopted in 2007 by the Public
University of the Basque Country following approval of the Master Plan for the Basque
Language regarding the offer of subjects. There are five main objectives regarding the
availability of courses in the coming years:

a. Reduce the linguistic imbalance affecting teachers at the Public University of the
Basque Country (UPV/EHU)

b. Supplement studies offered in Basque to the point where all core and compulsory
subjects can be offered in Basque.

c. Secure an adequate presence of Basque in optional subjects to the point where the right
to pursue all one’s studies in Basque can be guaranteed, depending on an assessment
of the number of potential students.

d. Improve the situation of the bilingual teachers who suffer the worst working conditions.

e. If the measures described above are taken, progress will also have been made
towards fulfilment of the fifth and last objective, i.e. in relation the normalisation of
Basque, to convert the Public University of the Basque Country into an essential point
of reference for Basque society and into a forerunner and stimulus for that process.

Pursuant to Article 28 of Basic Law 10/1982, of 24 November, on Normalisation of the Use
of Basque, the Government will promote the teaching of Basque for adults and literacy for
the

Basque-speaking population.

Since it was founded in 1983, the Autonomous Institute for Adult Literacy and
“Euskaldunización” (HABE) has been specifically addressing this task, as set out in the
second section of Law 29/1983, of 25 November, creating the Institute for Adult Literacy
and “re-euskaldunización” (re-Basquisation) and regulating the Euskaltegis (Basque
language institutes for adults).

The Autonomous Community of the Basque Country has developed a network of over 100
euskaltegis or adult Euskaldunización centres. The data for these centres are shown
below:

order to learn or improve their knowledge of Basque (an estimated 40,000 persons in
September 2009); of these, 4,800 students chose the self-teaching method. The enrolment
data are set forth below:

Development of the Basic Curriculum for the Euskaldunización (Basquisation) of
Adults

706

The objective of the Basic Curriculum for Adult Euskaldunización (CBEA), approved in
2000 and organised in four levels, is to establish the objectives, contents, methodology
and criteria for evaluating each level, based on a communicative approach to language.
The 2000 Basic Curriculum regulated fully the first, second and third levels of the Institute
for Adult Literacy and the Teaching of Euskera to Adults (HABE). In 2006, it established
the contents and evaluation criteria of the 4th level, thus completing the curriculum.

Afterwards, taking into consideration the entry into force in 2007 of the full curriculum,
HABE designed the accreditation examination for the 3rd level of the Basic Curriculum for
Adult Euskaldunización in the academic year 2007-2008 and organised pilot courses to
establish the 4th level of the curriculum in the euskaltegis. Thus, since the academic year
2008-2009, all the levels in the HABE curriculum are offered on an ordinary basis in the
euskaltegis. Since 2008, HABE has also introduced two annual accreditation examinations
in the four levels of the curriculum (equivalent to levels B1, B2, C1 and C2 of the European
Framework for Languages).

HABE is also currently developing and defining the levels equivalent to A1 and A2 of the
European Framework for Languages, in order to improve the Basque learning process at
the initial levels and to promote general knowledge among the adult population at least
until the intermediate level.

sub-paragraph g: to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

The teaching of contents, procedures and values relating to the Basque dimension of the
curriculum (Basque curriculum (DVC): history, geography, literature, art, etc.) is an activity
protected by law, which grants the Autonomous Community the right to regulate 45% of all
curricular material. As a result, the Community’s curricular decrees and regulations contain
courses and components expressly designed to cover that area. Unfortunately, the reality
is less exciting: treatment of the Basque Country in school textbooks rarely reaches
significant figures (except in subjects such as Basque literature and the history of the
Basque Country), and teacher training in those subjects is still very far from satisfactory.

Nevertheless, this is an area in which real quantifiable progress is being made. The
Basque Government intends to give priority to this topic in the coming years.
707

sub-paragraph h: to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;

This paragraph has been largely complied with. Basic Law 10/1982 on normalisation of the
use of Basque requires the Basque Government to take the necessary steps for the
progressive Euskaldunización (“Basquisation”) of teachers and to indicate which teaching
posts or units require knowledge of Basque.
Similarly, Law 2/1993, of 19 February, on Non-University Teaching Bodies of the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (BOPV 25-2-1993) introduces rules on
linguistic normalisation (Articles 48 to 54). Article 49 states:

Article 49. Teaching posts in the Basque education authority will have their corresponding
language profile. The profile will indicate the general level of linguistic competence in
Basque needed to fill the post concerned and perform the duties attaching to it. Where a
language profile is not compulsory, it will be used exclusively to determine to what extent
knowledge of Basque is to be considered an advantage.

Decree 47/1993, of 9 March, subsequently laid down the criteria for language profiles for
teaching posts and their compliance deadlines (BOPV 2-4-1993). This decree filled a
regulatory vacuum and broadened the provisions of the aforementioned Law on NonUniversity Teaching Bodies of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country by
regulating the linguistic normalisation process in the non-university teaching sector.
According to Article 3, two language profiles apply teachers: Language Profile 1 and
Language Profile 2.
Language Profile 1 will apply to teaching posts filled by teachers who do not teach Basque
or in Basque, thus ensuring the linguistic competence needed to use Basque as a
relationship language.

708

Language Profile 2 will apply to teaching posts filled by teachers who teach Basque or in
Basque, thus ensuring the linguistic competence needed to use Euskera as a relationship
and teaching language.
The official regulations therefore state this explicitly. In both initial and continuing training,
there is an increasingly wide range of facilities for training in Basque. Nevertheless, a great
deal of work is still required in both types of training (GARATU programme).
Set forth below are data on the language profiles of teachers in the Autonomous
Community of the Basque Country. The data relate to non-university teachers in both
public and private establishments (pre-school, primary and secondary, baccalaureate,
vocational training and adult education):

The trend in knowledge of Basque and profile compliance among teachers in both cases is
increasing; likewise, the number of teachers with no approved language profile is
decreasing both quantitatively and in percentage terms.

709

However, the resources available to the Public University of the Basque Country
(UPV/EHU) to meet increasing pupil demand have not increased on a similar scale. Here,
the language profile of teachers is a truly significant and noteworthy statistic. Despite
major efforts over the past few years and a significant increase in bilingual teacher
recruitment, the percentage of bilingual teachers is now around 35%, compared with 30%
five years ago. However, in view of demand, this percentage is insufficient and one of the
chief objectives of any normalisation planning must be a gradual decrease in this systemic
imbalance, since the UPV/EHU will continue to be a public university in the future and, as
such, must provide an adequate response to demand from Basque society.

sub-paragraph i) to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing the teaching of
regional or minority languages and for drawing up periodic reports of their findings, which
will be made public.

The statistical services of the Department of Education, Universities and Research and
certain administrative bodies are steadily carrying out this task with increasing success.

The Information Systems service of the Directorate of Material Resources, Computer
Systems and Organisation of the Department of Education, Universities and Research of
the Basque Government issues the following publications.
•

o

Pupils and groups by municipality, network (public or private), educational level,

year and language model.
o

Study of the evolution of pre-enrolment by network and language model.

These data are published annually as information is gathered: Pre-school Cycle 2, Primary
Education and Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO) in May; Pre-school Cycle 1 in
July; Baccalaureate and Occupational Training in September. Information is only kept on
the Department’s web page until the enrolment data are published.
•

In the section:

Statistics on the Education System

The Basque Language Advisory Board, which renewed its members in 2007, is
responsible for studying and analysing, on the instructions of the Basque Government, any

711

matters relating to linguistic normalisation in the Autonomous Community of the Basque
Country.

Thus, during the debate and reflections carried out during the year through the Euskera
XXI initiative, the Basque Language Advisory Board has analysed the situation of the
Basque language in the current Basque education system.

paragraph 2) With regard to education and in respect of territories other than those in
which the regional or minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if
the number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or
provide teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the appropriate stages of
education.

The Basque Government directly addresses the educational needs of schoolchildren in the
Autonomous Community. Nevertheless, it also establishes operational links with
institutions outside the Community to encourage activities designed to increase the
knowledge of use of the Basque language.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 9. JUDICIAL AUTHORITIES
Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which the
number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies the measures
specified below, according to the situation of each of these languages and on condition
that the use of the facilities afforded by the present paragraph is not considered by the
judge to hamper the proper administration of justice:
a) in criminal procedures:
sub-paragraph a.i) to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or
sub-paragraph a.ii) to guarantee the accused the right to use his/her regional or minority
language; and/or
The person who guarantees all the rights of the accused in the course of the proceedings
is the judge and, generally, when an accused wishes to use Basque, that is guaranteed.

712

Because only a minority of participants in judicial proceedings have a knowledge of
Basque, use is made of the translation service provided by the Basque Government’s
Department of Justice.
sub-paragraph a.iii): to provide that requests and evidence, whether written or oral, shall
not be considered inadmissible solely because they are formulated in a regional or
minority language; and/or
Requests and evidence are allowed and are not considered inadmissible solely because
they are formulated in the language of the Autonomous Community. However, because
the parties usually have no knowledge of the language, the services of a
translator/interpreter must be enlisted, which has two main consequences:
a) in oral proceedings: loss of immediacy
b) in written proceedings: need for translation, which increases the length of the
proceedings
sub-paragraph a.iv):

to produce, on request, documents connected with legal

proceedings in the relevant regional or minority language, if necessary by the use of
interpreters and translations involving no extra expense for the persons concerned;

This is complied with since the Basque translation service translates all the documentation
which it receives from judicial bodies.

b) in civil proceedings:
sub-paragraph b.i) to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages;
sub-paragraph b, ii) to allow, whenever the litigant has to appear in person before a
court, that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby
incurring additional expense; and/or
sub-paragraph b, iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations.

c) in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
sub-paragraph c.i) to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or
713

sub-paragraph c, ii) to allow, whenever the litigant has to appear in person before a
court, that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby
incurring additional expense; and/or
sub-paragraph c, iii) to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations.

sub-paragraph d) to take steps to ensure that the application of sub-paragraphs i and iii
of b and c above and any necessary use of interpreters and translations does not
involve extra expense for the persons concerned.
Paragraph 2: not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State solely
because they are drafted in a regional or minority language;
Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to make available in the regional or minority
languages the most important national statutory texts and those relating particularly to
users of these languages, unless they are otherwise provided.

The Basque Government’s Department of Justice, in collaboration with the University of
Deusto and the University of the Basque Country, has published the following national
legal texts:
•

Organic Law regulating the criminal responsibility of minors.

•

Law and Regulations on the Civil Registry.

•

Civil Procedure Law.

•

Criminal Procedure Law.

•

Spanish Constitution.

•

Labour Procedure Law.

•

Law of Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction.

•

Organic Law of the Constitutional Court.

•

Consumer Legislation.

•

Organic Law of the Judiciary.

Numerous other laws are at different stages of translation.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 10. PUBLIC SERVICES AND CIVIL SERVANTS.
ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC SERVICES.

Paragraph 1. Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number of
residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the measures
specified below, and according to the situation of each language, the Parties
undertake, as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a, i) to ensure that the administrative authorities use the regional or
minority languages; or
sub-paragraph b: to make available widely used administrative texts and forms for the
population in the regional or minority languages or in bilingual versions.
sub-paragraph c: to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a regional
or minority language.

With respect to the compliance of the General State Administration with this article, the
degree of compliance of each Ministry is detailed separately:
MINISTRY OF THE PRESIDENCY:

The Official State Gazette published the Spanish Constitution in Basque in 2007.

A collaboration agreement between the Official State Gazette (BOE) and the Basque
Government to translate state legislation published in the BOE into Basque is in the very
advanced stages.

12.5% of the Sociological Research Centre’s (Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas CIS) leaflets for surveys are in Basque (around 5,000).

The Mutual Society of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) will issue 10 publications in Euskera
in 2010. This entity also publishes informative leaflets on matters related with its activities
in Spanish and in the co-official languages. These documents are published in both printed
and electronic format and are available on the MUFACE web page. To date, the normal
circulations of these types of publications are as follows:
716

•

900,000 copies in Spanish

•

2,000 copies in Basque

The MUFACE journal is currently being redesigned and will improve the electronic version
and significantly reduce the number of printed copies. The 2010 Publications Plan includes

•

publicity campaigns in bilingual or co-official language versions.

In conformity with Law 29/2005, on Institutional Publicity, which provides that “institutional
campaigns shall make use of Castilian and, in addition, depending on the area covered by
a campaign, the co-official languages of the Autonomous Communities, while complying
with each Autonomous Community’s legislation on the use of the co-official languages”,
certain institutional campaigns promoted by the Ministry of the Presidency and its public

The Government Subdelegation in Vizcaya carried out 3 campaigns in Basque,
representing 25% of all its campaigns.

The Mutual Society of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) publishes printed institutional
material for publicity campaigns in the co-official languages.
•

Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages.

The pages on the “060.es” portal (www.060.es) are available in the different co-official
languages. The home page, secondary pages and all the necessary navigation elements
(header menus, secondary page menus, left-hand and right-hand menus) of this web page
are presented in the co-official languages. The new “060” portal will have the same
structure, and there are plans to gradually translate the contents into the co-official
languages and into English.

The static elements, menus, submenus, titles and permanent information on the www.lamoncloa.es web page are translated into Basque.

On the www.mpr.es web page, the static elements, menus, submenus, titles and
permanent information are translated as far as the first navigation level, as provided in the
718

“Guide for editing and publishing General State Administration websites”, which
establishes the general requirement for static documents containing more general
information and which are not expected to require substantial modification and/or updating
to be translated.

The National Agency for the Evaluation of Public Policies (AEVAL) web page is fully
accessible, which means that there is a duplicate web page in each co-official language,
with an independent home page. As regards the contents:

-

All the static elements (menus, submenus, titles, etc.) are translated.

-

All navigation levels in the sections containing institutional and theoretical or
doctrinal information on matters relating to the Agency’s activities are translated,
representing 40% of all pages.

-

Mixed translation (first navigation level in a co-official language and subsequent
levels in Spanish) of web pages containing regular variable sections (quality permits,
annual evaluations, etc.), i.e. 30% of all pages.

-

The “News”, “Events” or “Announcements” pages, which are constantly updated,
are not translated (30% of all pages).

All the static and organisational contents on the web page of the Official State Gazette
(Boletín Oficial del Estado – BOE) – www.boe.es – are translated into the co-official
languages.

The Centre for Political and Constitutional Studies (CEPC) is currently adapting its web
page by translating the static and organisational elements, as well as relevant contents,
into the co-official languages.

The following parts of the CIS (Sociological Research Centre) web page are translated into
the co-official languages:
• All the navigation pages in HTML format
• On-line application forms but not validated forms that must be printed and posted.
• The form for downloading microdata.

719

The only contents of the National Institute of the Public Administration web page that may
appear in languages other than Spanish are the permanent informative elements (the
names of the different channels on the web page) and the headers on the home page,
since information introduced on the web page is only relevant for a short period since it is
generated very rapidly.

MUFACE is currently modifying its web page. The new web page is expected to be
operative shortly. Details of the current and new web pages are described below:

1) Current web page

Approximately 55-60% of the static web page (excluding electronic services, under the
general title of "Mutual Society of State Civil Servants-live") has been completely
translated. This means that practically all the first and second navigation levels are
translated, but after navigation level three the contents are only available in Spanish.
Almost all the institutional information has been translated (approximately 97%).
Approximately 95% of the downloadable forms have been translated.

2) New web page (due to come on-line during the year)

2.1) 80% of the static web page will be translated.
2.2) The electronic services will only be available in Spanish. Coverage in the other coofficial languages will be gradually completed during 2010.

The following elements on the National Heritage Board web page are translated:

- Change language menu
- Top menu with main sections of the portal
- Supplementary menu (map of the web page, contacts, etc.)
•

requests received and answered in co-official languages.

The INAP has not received any requests in co-official languages, although it is able to
reply to any requests in the co-official language in which they are submitted.

720

Requests for information received by MUFACE and submitted in a co-official language are
answered in Spanish.

The following conclusions and results may be drawn from the analysis of the latest
available data regarding the use of co-official languages in services requested by
MUFACE members:

The use of Basque by MUFACE members in the 3 Basque provinces is marginal. Of the
785 requests studied at the 4 provincial offices, only 1 request was submitted in Basque,
specifically in Vizcaya. The collective in the 3 provinces in the Basque Country differs from
those in the rest of Spain because it does not include most teachers, who belong to
specific regional bodies.

Few documents registered in the General Register of the National Heritage Board were
written in Basque; these were bilingual notifications and letters relating to the payment of
fees and fines in administrative proceedings or courts. All replies were written in Spanish.

All requests received by the Conflict of Interest Office are received and answered in
Spanish. Requests are sometimes accompanied by copies of specific documents written in
a co-official language.

No requests were received at the Government Subdelegation of Guipúzcoa in Basque.

The Government Subdelegation in Vizcaya has received 2 requests in Basque,
representing 2.5% of all requests received.
•

staff with knowledge of official languages.

The Government Delegation in the Basque Country has 107 employees, including 7 civil
servants with advanced knowledge of Basque. It also has two translators. The situation
regarding Basque language knowledge is as follows:

to users in the State’s four co-official languages.
The National Library (Biblioteca Nacional de España – BNE) redesigned its institutional
web page in May 2009. The new web page is designed as a single multilingual portal
allowing users to select the navigation language. This means that the portal’s structure is
the same in any language, thus ensuring that all the contents are shown in the official
language of Spain – Spanish – and in the co-official languages.
In 2010, National Library also plans to set up a platform that will provide access to a
translation system integrated on its web page, thus allowing it to monitor all outstanding
740

Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages.

The Ministry’s web page
The Ministry’s web page (http://www.mpt.es) is available in the co-official languages, and
much of its contents have been translated into those languages. Great efforts have been
made in recent years to revise and translate the contents of the web page.

Given the huge volume of information available on the Ministry of Territorial Policy’s web
page, the decision was take to adapt the web page by navigation levels, starting with the
first levels since these are the most visible.

At present, the contents of the web page have been translated at least as far as the fourth
navigation level, and even more in some sections. For now, “Latest News” has been
excluded since this information has to be published immediately and this immediacy would
be lost if it were necessary to wait for such news to be translated. Translating this
information at a later date has not been considered a priority because interest in such
news diminishes with time.

In short, it is estimated that more than 300 pages have now been translated.

Statistics on visits to the web page http://www.mpt.es in 2009 in the different co-official
languages are provided below:

Contents publishers have access to an infrastructure that allows them to introduce
translations via a user-friendly interface, and they receive the translated texts that they
request for inclusion on the web page.

For the future, planned improvements in the publication environment include most notably
a project to implement a translations workflow that will facilitate the process for obtaining
translations and achieve greater involvement of publishers in the inclusion of these
translations.

This web page (http://www.mpt.es) has also been used to provide town and city councils
that receive funds under the State Fund for Local Investment with posters announcing
projects

in

co-official

languages,

http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html. These posters have
been reused for the State Fund for Employment and Local Sustainability.

The need for translated contents is being taken into account in the implementation of the
Ministry's electronic site. “Acceda” (Access), the basic application used on the electronic
site, has been adapted to enable forms used by citizens in electronic formalities and
procedures to be translated, and will also enable the inclusion of the different contents
translated into the co-official languages, as well as into other languages such as English
and French.

Intranet of the Ministry of Territorial Policy

Spain’s linguistic diversity has also been taken into account in the work places of Ministry
employees. The Ministry’s Intranet (http://intranet.mpt.es) was designed based on this
criterion, with pages available in co-official language versions and the capacity to upload
translated contents into those work environments.

D) The Tax Office:

In relation to contents published in the co-official languages in Spain on the Tax Office’s
website (portal), the Agency’s linguistic policy focuses on ensuring each citizen is able to
communicate effectively in the co-official language of their choice. Specific information is
also available in Basque.

Given the volume of information to be translated, translated versions of these pages are
gradually being incorporated. Users are therefore offered contents in Catalan, Galician and
Valencian and pages not yet available in those languages can be consulted in Spanish.
Nevertheless, the Tax Office undertakes to make improvements in this area. In any case, it
ensures that tax payers can use the co-official language in their respective Autonomous
Communities.

The translated contents range from all navigation levels, except “Latest News”, due to its
immediacy, and other exceptions that are not translated for technical reasons or specific
translation turnaround times, particularly in the case of PDF documents. In terms of the
translation of legal provisions, only those published and translated into the corresponding
co-official language in official gazettes are incorporated.

sub-paragraph b: to make available widely used administrative texts and forms for the
population in the regional or minority languages or in bilingual versions;

Bilingual forms are generally available to citizens in central government offices based in
the Autonomous Community.

sub-paragraph c: to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a regional
or minority language.

Under Article 36 of State Law 30/1992, of 26 November, on the Legal Regime of Public
Administration and the Common Administrative Procedure, the use of Spanish is
obligatory in proceedings conducted by the General State Administration.

Proceedings will only be conducted in Basque if the persons who contact the
Administration do so in Basque. If several parties are involved in the proceedings and a
dispute arises regarding the languages spoken, the proceedings will be conducted in
Spanish, although any documents or statements required by the parties will be issued in
the language of their choice.
Paragraph 2: In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is such as to justify the
measures specified below, the Parties undertake to allow and/or encourage:
sub-paragraph a) the use of regional or minority languages within the framework of the
regional or local authority;

766

There provisions are generally complied with by the Administration in the Basque Country
and the “foral” and municipal authorities, although some complaints have been received in
relation to non-compliances.

Where the regional authorities are concerned, most non-compliances concern the regional
police force (Ertzaintza) and the health service (Osakidetza).

Most of these non-compliances are due to the fact that the staff in these two departments
lack the necessary command of Basque, although the regional authorities are working to
increase the linguistic proficiency of staff and the use of Basque by organising training
courses.

In the case of the municipal authorities, the sociolinguistic situation varies greatly from one
place to another, as does the linguistic proficiency of local staff. Although attention in
Basque is guaranteed in certain municipalities, this is not the case in others where, in
terms of verbal communication, there are shortcomings in the service provided to Basquespeaking citizens.

In 2006, the Vice-Ministry of Language Policy created a service (ELEBIDE) to protect the
linguistic rights of citizens. Its function is to channel complaints, enquiries and suggestions
from citizens on the use of Basque.

These services are offered on the following channels: the “012” telephone line; and the
web site www.euskadi.net/elebide.

In 2006, the ELEBIDE service received more than 100 complaints, enquiries and
suggestions; in 2007, it received 231; and in 2008, 305 incidents were registered.
Therefore, compared with previous years’ data, public demand for this service has
increased by 25%.

The campaign to promote the ELEBIDE service was launched on 23 April 2008, with three
objectives: firstly, to promote social awareness of linguistic rights; secondly, to bring the
ELEBIDE service closer to society; and thirdly, to show the channels for accessing this
service.
767

sub-paragraph b: the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to submit oral
or written applications in these languages;

Articles 5.2. a), 6.1 and 9.1 of Basque Basic Law 10/1982, of 24 November, on the
Normalisation of the Use of Basque, secure the fundamental linguistic right of conducting
relations in Basque or Spanish orally and/or in writing with the Administration and any
body or organisation established in the Autonomous Community.

In some cases, difficulties arise in asserting this right when trying to communicate verbally
in Basque owing to the lack of language training among civil servants.

sub-paragraph c: the publication by regional authorities of their official documents also in
the relevant regional or minority languages;

Article 8.1 of Basque Law 10/1982 stipulates that every legislative provision or official
decision adopted by public authorities in the Autonomous Community of the Basque
Country shall be drafted in bilingual form for the purpose of official publication.

Article 13 of this law requires official forms and models used by the public authorities in the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country to be bilingual.

sub-paragraph d: the publication by local authorities of their official documents also in the
relevant regional or minority languages;

See the comments in section c)

sub-paragraph e: the use by regional authorities of regional or minority languages in
debates in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s)
of the State;

768

Members of the Basque Parliament and its committees are free to express themselves in
Basque and Castilian. Article 1 of the Rules of Procedure of the Basque Parliament
provides as follows:
“Basque and Spanish shall be the official languages of the Basque Parliament
(Legebiltzarra), and may be used indistinctly. The official publications of the Parliament
shall be bilingual."

sub-paragraph f: the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages in debates
in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the
State;

Participants in debates in “foral” assemblies and local councils are free to speak in Basque
or Spanish.

Article 86 of State Royal Decree 2568/1986, of 28 November, approving the regulations
governing the organisation, functioning and legal regime of local authorities, provides as
follows:
“1. The notices convening sessions, agendas, motions, dissenting opinions, proposals
for decisions and opinions of advisory committees shall be drafted in Spanish or in the
language with co-official status in the Autonomous Community to which the authority
belongs, in accordance with the applicable legislation and the decisions taken in this
connection by the authority.
2. Spanish or the co-official language of the particular Autonomous Community may be
used in debates without distinction.”

sub-paragraph g: the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the
official language(s), of traditional or correct forms of place-names in regional or minority
languages.

Article 10.1 of Basque Law 10/1982 provides that the official names of areas, towns,
localities, geographical features and roads, and place names in general in the Basque
Autonomous Community, shall be determined by the Government, the “foral”
authorities of historic territories or local authorities in their respective spheres of
769

competence, in all cases respecting the Basque, Spanish or Castilian original, with the
correct spelling in each language.

In the event of a disagreement between the local authorities and the Basque
Government over the official names referred to in the preceding paragraph, the
Basque Government shall take a decision after consulting the Royal Academy of the
Basque Language (Euskaltzaindia).

Under Article 10.3 of the law, whenever the names differ significantly, both shall have
official status.

PARAGRAPH 3: With regard to public services provided by the administrative authorities
or other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
regional or minority languages are used, in accordance with the situation of each language
and as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a) to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used in the
provision of the service; or

Article 38.2 of Basque Law 6/2003 on the status of consumers and users stipulates
that, upon provision of a service, the use of both official languages must be
guaranteed in relations with consumers and users.

Decree 123/2008 was approved in July 2008 to guarantee the language rights of
consumers and users.

sub-paragraph b: to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a request and
receive a reply in these languages; or

Articles 5.2.a), 6.1 and 9.1 of Basic Basque Law 10/1982, on the normalisation of the
use of Basque, and Articles 37.b) and 38.3 of Basque Law 6/2003, on the status of

770

consumers and users, guarantee citizens’ right to submit applications or requests in
Basque at all times.

Paragraph 4: With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3
accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the following measures:

sub-paragraph a: translation or interpretation as may be required;

Translation of documents is arranged at the request of the persons concerned.

Article 36 of State Law 10/1992 of 26 November 1992, on the legal regime of public
administration and the common administrative procedure, states that members of the
public who contact General State Administration agencies based in the Autonomous
Community may use the co-official language. If the proceedings are conducted in
Spanish, any documents required by the interested parties will be issued in the language
of their choice, and the administration covering the cost of the translation.

Under Article 36.3 of the law, the investigating public authority is required to translate
into Spanish any documents or files, or parts of same, which must be valid outside the
Autonomous Community, as well as any documents intended for the parties, whenever
these are expressly requested.

With regard to the government of the Autonomous Community and the “foral” and local
authorities, Articles 5.2.a), 6.1 and 8.2 of Basque Law 10/1982 recognise the right of
citizens to submit and receive documentation in the official language of their choice. If
a translation is required, the cost must be borne by the administration concerned.

In this sense, special mention must be made of Decree 88/2009, of 21 April, on the
authorisation of sworn translators and interpreters. This Decree aims to regulate the
professional authorisation of persons to work as sworn translators or interpreters from
Basque to other languages and from other languages to Basque, and to create a register
of professionals authorised to work in this profession.

sub-paragraph b: recruitment and, where necessary, training of the officials and
other public service employees required;
771

The Basque Government and the “foral” and local authorities guarantee the
recruitment of staff with knowledge of Basque. In some cases, knowledge of Basque is
obligatory due to the specific local sociolinguistic context, while on other occasions it is
considered to be an advantage.

The legal basis for this is established in Basque Basic Law 10/1982, on the
normalisation of the use of Basque, Basque Law 6/1989 of 6 July 1989 on the Basque
civil service, and Basque Decree 86/1997, of 15 April 1997, regulating the process of
normalisation of the use of Basque in the regional public administration.

The plans to promote the use of Basque were launched in 2007 in most departments of
the Basque Government and regional entities, and affect three areas: public services;
areas classified as bilingual at the end of the plan; and workers who, despite not being
bilingual, wish to accredit the obligatory linguistic profile and participate in the project.

In compliance with Decree 86/1997, the Government Council of 1 July 2008 approved the
Basque Government’s Basque Language Plan for the Fourth Planning Period (20082012). In this plan, special importance is attributed to the criteria governing the use of
official languages. The Plan includes the following new elements: it is based on the use of
the language (each worker communicates at least once in Basque); a larger number of
workers participate; the methodology changes and the importance of the organisational
structure is emphasized.

In the first year of each planning period, all the Public Administrations must design and
approve their plans to promote the use of Basque. For this purpose, the Vice-Ministry for
Language Policy presented the criteria and bases used to develop the Basque
Government’s Plan on the Use of the Basque Language to all the Public Administrations.
These criteria and bases are completely flexible, allowing each Public Administration to
decide how it wishes to comply with them and adapt them to its requirements.

In 2008, a communication campaign was launched in Basque Government departments
and in Autonomous Community entities to provide information on the 4th Planning Period.
Many workers participated in this campaign. The main slogan was: Puestos a elegir,
prefiero en euskera (“If I have to choose, I prefer Basque”).
772

Most of the regional departments and entities approved the plan on the use of the Basque
language corresponding to the 4th Planning Period.

Decree 128/2007, of 31 August, established the regulations that must be complied with by
the Regional Ministry of Culture when issuing reports on the procedure for approving
general provisions. The Department of Culture is responsible for drafting mandatory
reports on general provisions proposed by the Basque Government. These reports must
be issued within a maximum of one month and their purpose is to evaluate the impact that
proposed regulations will have on the normalisation of the use of Basque, and to analyse
compliance of these proposed regulations with language regulations.

Since the entry into force of Decree 128/2007, of 31 August, as at 31 December 2008, 187
reports had been issued in response to requests submitted by the different governmental
departments.

sub-paragraph c: compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to be appointed in the
territory in which that language is used.

In the Regional Administration and the “foral” and local authorities, the question of the
mobility of civil servants does not arise since Basque has official status in the entire
Basque region.
Paragraph 5: The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names in the
regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.

The use and adoption of family names in Basque by citizens is guaranteed and there are
no obstacles to prevent them from doing so.

The National Law on the Civil Registry allows interested parties to change their first name
for an onomastic equivalent in another official language of Spain.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 11. MEDIA.
773

Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority languages
within the territories in which those languages are spoken, according to the situation of
each language, to the extent that the public authorities, directly or indirectly, are
competent, have power or play a role in this field, and respecting the principle of the
independent and autonomy of the media:

The Basic Law on normalisation of the use of Basque, approved by the Basque Parliament
in 1982, includes a section on means for guaranteeing the use and presence of the
language in the media. More specifically, the aforementioned Law guarantees all citizens
the right to be informed by the media in both Basque and Spanish. To guarantee this right,
the Basque Government was urged to take steps to encourage the presence of Basque in
the media. Not only was it to increase the presence of Basque, but also gradually balance
the use of both official languages.

In 1984, the Basque Government for the first time issued rules providing for the award of
subsidies to Basque-language magazines. Since then, the Basque Government has
renewed these subsidies. The subsidies have changed over the years both in size and in
terms and in terms of their objectives, requirements and qualifying criteria. In 2006, for
example, a total of 4,750,000 euros was earmarked for the consolidation, development
and normalisation of Basque-language media. From 2006 to 2009, the amounts of these
subsidies have increased; in 2009, 5,725,000 euros were earmarked for these subsidies
(12% more than in 2006). The following table presents a summary:

Year

The following projects receive subsidies under this programme:
1. Daily printed press entirely in Basque.
a) Daily newspapers entirely in Basque circulated throughout the Basque
Country.
774

b) Daily newspapers entirely in Basque circulated in a particular municipality
or district.

2. Magazines printed entirely in Basque.
a) general news or specialist magazines (philosophy, science, music, nature, for
children and young people, etc.), circulated throughout the Basque Country.
b) general news magazines circulated in a particular municipality or district.

3. Daily newspapers written mainly in Castilian.
a) supplements entirely in Basque and circulated with daily newspapers written
mainly in Castilian.
b) reference pages in Basque, corresponding to dailies that mainly use Spanish. In
this case, applicants must publish a weekly minimum equivalent to twelve
standard pages in Basque in the sections on society, politics, world, economy,
sports and culture. This information in Basque must contain relevant information
and mainly consist of articles, reports, interviews and analyses/comments that
contribute added value on the part of the newspaper. In terms of the required
minimum, this shall not include local information pages in which the applicant
must nevertheless guarantee the presence of Basque. The presence – in
quantitative and qualitative terms – of Basque on front-pages and back-pages of
the newspaper will be valued. In the case of regional editions of national dailies,
a minimum of four pages of contents shall be in Basque per week.

4.Duly authorised radio stations broadcasting partly or entirely in Basque.

5.Television channels broadcasting partly or entirely in Basque.

6.On-line newspapers and magazines and news agencies which publish news entirely
in Basque.

sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service
mission: to ensure the creation of at least one radio station and one television channel in
the regional or minority languages

775

The public-service radio-television broadcaster Radio Televisión Vasca (EITB) broadcasts
on four channels. EITB broadcasts whole programmes in Basque on its television
channels ETB-1 and ETB-2. Also, in accordance with the programme contract, ETB-4 is
expected to start broadcasting in 2009, with identical broadcasting times percentage-wise
in Basque and Spanish.

In terms of radio-broadcasting, EITB broadcasts whole programmes in Basque on its
generalist radio channel (Euskadi Irratia). It also has a radio channel specifically for
children and young people (Euskadi Gaztea), which broadcasts entirely in Basque and a
music radio channel in Basque and Spanish (EITB-Musika).

Local television

As mentioned earlier in this report, existing regulations governing local digital television
have adopted a bilingual model, adapted to the sociolinguistic situation of each
catchment area (the catchment areas for digital local television are defined by
central

government)

and

encourage

the broadcasting of whole programmes in

Basque.

Based on generally applicable minimum criteria, quotas are assigned in keeping with the
sociolinguistic characteristics of each area. The Basque Autonomous Community was
assigned 15 groups of channels, each with a capacity of four digital television channels.

The criteria for public licensees (local authorities) and private licensees differ. For public
licensees they are more demanding, as the public sector is expected to set an example
with regard to the implementation of public policy for private operators to follow.

Considering the setting of local television and the sociolinguistic situation in the
Basque Country, which has its own language, all local television channels will
provide a suitable proportion of programmes in Basque and promote the use of
Basque as the main language in their programmes. For this purpose, in the allocation
procedure the use of Basque shall be favoured in accordance with criteria that positively
value the presence of Basque above the required minimum and, in particular, full
broadcasts in Basque.
776

Television channels managed directly by the local authorities are expected to
broadcast at least 50% of their programmes in Basque. This minimum requirement
increases the larger the bilingual population of a local area. In this respect, only DonostiaSan Sebastián City Council has been awarded a license to directly manage the local
analogue television service.

Both publicly and privately run channels are required to broadcast their programme quota
in Basque between 7 am and midnight. And in prime time, the percentage of programme
hours in Basque must be at least equivalent to the percentage of Basque-speakers in the
local population.

Programmes in Basque may be introduced gradually. Television channels run by
directly local authorities in areas with fewer than 25% of Basque-speakers must
guarantee a minimum of 25% of their air time in Basque from the start of the licensing
period and build that up to at least 50% by the end of the 7-year period. Where
Basque-speakers number 25% of the local population or more, television channels
must provide 50% of their programmes in Basque from the start and build up to
the prescribed percentage by the end of the seven years where applicable.

In short, the approved regulations guarantee the presence of the Basque language on all
local television channels to a greater or lesser extent.

Radio-broadcasting:

Public licensees will ensure a presence of Basque that is at least proportional to the total
percentages calculated for each Municipality in the latest Basque Statistics Yearbook,
published by Eustat.

sub-paragraph b, i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio
station in the regional or minority languages;

Radio-broadcasting:

777

The private licence-holders now broadcasting were awarded licences in the lat 1980s, and
the licences were made permanent in 1993. Following an initial licensing period of 10
years, in 2003 the licences became tacitly renewable for successive 10-year periods. This
renewal was applied in keeping with Article 114 of Law 53/2002, of 30 December, on
fiscal, administrative and social measures.

Current regulations establish the need to value the balanced use of both official languages
in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country in relation to the award of licenses.

Additionally, Royal Decree 964/2006, of 1 September, approved the Spanish national
technical plan for VHF radio broadcasting. Under this technical plan, a total of 34
frequencies must be licensed by the Basque Autonomous Community.

sub-paragraph c, i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

According to Decree 190/2006, of 3 October, which regulates local terrestrial television
services, Basque must occupy a minimum of 20% of programming time on local television
channels managed by private companies, regardless of the sociolinguistic structure of the
area. In catchment areas that exceed this percentage, the percentage of programmes in
Basque must be equivalent to the percentage of bilinguals in the corresponding service
area. This index will increase by the corresponding percentage according to the offer
presented by the licensee in the bidding process, and broadcasts may even be entirely in
Basque.

However, it establishes the following transitory regime: television channels run by private
concerns in areas with fewer than 25% of Basque-speakers must broadcast at least 20%
of their air time in Basque from the start of the licensing period and built up to the
prescribed percentage by the end of that percentage (i.e. at least 70% of 25% or their
programmes) in Basque from the outset and fully comply with their quota by the end of the
initial 7-year period.

778

In 2007, licenses were awarded for the provision of local terrestrial television services in
accordance with the abovementioned criteria. A total of 31 television channel licenses
were awarded. These channels have undertaken to comply with the established
requirements regarding language.

This ensures that in each of the 15 areas at least one local television channel will
broadcast entirely in Basque and the presence of Basque will be guaranteed on all
channels to a greater or lesser extent.

None of the national private television channels (Antena 3, Cuatro, Tele 5, La Sexta, Canal
+, etc.) broadcast in Basque.

There are no regional private television channels.

sub-paragraph d: to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio
and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

During 2006, 2007 and 2008, various types of aid have been offered to support
audiovisual creation, direction and production, with a total investment of 4,971,000.00
euros.

Aid for the promotion and publicity of fictional and animated feature films and
documentaries, initiated in 2007, amounted to 590,000.00 euros in 2007 and 2008.

Lastly, a line of subsidies launched in 2007 for the creation and production of audiovisual
contents in new media amounted to 60,000 euros in the last two years.

In 2008, EITB signed a four-year collaboration agreement with IBAIA (Association of
Independent Producers of the Basque Country) and EPV/APV (Association of Basque
Producers) to support Basque independent audiovisual production. The main objectives of
the agreement are: “To support the normalisation of the Basque language through the
creation, production and release of works in Basque”. This agreement replaces the
previous three-year agreement signed in 2005.

779

There is also collaboration with ONCE (the National Organisation for the Blind) to give
blind people access to works in Basque language. The latest initiative in this regard was
an agreement signed in 2006 with ONCE to give blind people access to works of Basque
literature in audio format. The agreement envisages the publication of 235 copies.

sub-paragraph e i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at
least one newspaper in the regional or minority languages;

Through the Order of the Department of Culture regulating the granting of subsidies for the
consolidation, development and normalisation of Basque-language media, the Basque
daily newspaper, BERRIA, published entirely in Euskera, which is circulated throughout
the Basque Country, receives an annual subsidy.

In the period 2006-2008, this newspaper received 4,752,695.00 € in aid.

780

The calls for applications for financial aid for audiovisual production continued in 2006 and
2007. Under this programme, repayable interest-free loans and loans to finance contracts
are granted, in a global annual amount that has remained steady at 8,235,000 euros.

In 2008, the system regulating the funding of audiovisual production in the Basque
Autonomous Community was modified.

sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using
regional or minority languages.

The journalist training measures adopted fall under the subsidy arrangements for media in
Basque mentioned previously.

Furthermore, the University of the Basque Country offers Journalism courses entirely in
Basque.

Paragraph 2: The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language used in identical or similar
form to a regional or minority language, and not to oppose the retransmission of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in such a language. They further
undertake to ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and
free circulation of information in the written press in a language used in identical or similar
form to a regional or minority language. The exercise of the above-mentioned freedoms,
since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such
formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are
necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial
integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of
health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for
preventing disclosure
of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of
the judiciary.

781

Radio and television programmes in the Basque Autonomous Community comply with the
appropriate technical requirements.

The only restrictions are based on security needs, civil aviation requirements or
interference with other authorised programmes.

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of the users of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into account within such bodies as may be
established in accordance with the law with responsibility for guaranteeing the freedom
and pluralism of the media.

This has already been mentioned above.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 12. CULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND FACILITIES.

Paragraph 1. With regard to cultural activities and facilities – especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as well
as literary work and film production, vernacular forms of cultural expression, festivals and
the culture industries, including inter alia the use of new technologies – the Parties
undertake, within the territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the
public authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:

sub-paragraph a: to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works produced in these
languages;

The Regional Ministry of Culture of the Basque Government organises the annual
“Euskadi” Literature Prizes. Two of the four prize categories (general literature in
Basque and literature in Basque for children and teenagers) are for the best creative
literary works published during the preceding year.

782

Grants are also offered every year to promote publishing in Basque in the Basque
Country, especially at the Basque Book and Record Fair held in Durango and the
various book fairs in the main Basque towns and cities, as well as conferences and
other activities.

The Regional Ministry of Culture is also using these awards to encourage the creation,
production and dissemination of literary works written in Basque through incentives in
the scoring process, which determine whether entries should receive subsidies or not,
and if so, how much should be allocated.

The Library Service promotes the use of Basque in public life in the following ways:
Catalogue of bilingual authorities. The public libraries’ bibliographical catalogues
comprise information on Basque authors and works.
General support. An annual consignment of about 350 books in Basque is sent
to all libraries.
The Basque Vice-Ministry for Language Policy (VPL) co-operates in the
financial and other fields with the main cultural bodies operating in the area of
Basque language and culture, in order to compile, normalise, promote and
disseminate the Basque language and culture in the Basque Country and
elsewhere, concluding periodical contracts for subsidies to enable these
organisations to work in the aforementioned fields. The Basque Government
collaborates with the following bodies:
EIZIE: Association of Basque Translators and Interpreters
EIE: Basque Writers’ Association
ASMOZ Foundation
TOPAGUNEA: Basque Associations Federation
UNESCO Etxea
Euskaltzaindia: Royal Academy of the Basque Language
EHBE: Bertsolaris Association of the Basque Country
Labayru Ikastetxea/Labayru Institute: Centre for research into Basque culture.
The Regional Ministry of Culture has promoted the knowledge of the use of
Basque abroad mainly through participation in language fairs and launching
readers' networks in universities outside the Basque Country.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following actions:
783

Promotion of Film and Audiovisual Production

Applicable legislation currently in force

Article 36 of Law 55/2007, of 28 December, on Cinema, establishes the following:
“In n order to promote and protect the use of the co-official languages other than Spanish
in film and audiovisual production, promoting the cultural plurality of Spain and equal
opportunities of the own languages of each territory in audiovisual expression and
dissemination, a fund of aid or specific credits shall be established that shall be transferred
in their entirety to the competent Bodies of the Autonomous Communities that shall
manage them in accordance with their responsibilities. This State contribution, based on
the principle of co-responsibility, shall be assigned annually in the General State Budgets
and shall be used for the promotion, distribution, exhibition and promotion of the
Cinematographic and Audiovisual Industry in the aforementioned languages”.

Additional Provision Six of the Law on Cinema, regulating agreements to promote
cinematographic and audiovisual production in co-official languages other than Spanish,
states as follows:
“Through such agreements, the Ministry of Culture shall determine the credits
envisaged in Article 36 of the Law, either annually equivalent to the total contributions
that the Community in question has assigned in the preceding year to support and
promote audiovisual production, distribution and promotion in a co-official language
other than Spanish. The allowance received by each Autonomous Community shall
not be more than 50% of the total aid received by audiovisual companies residing in
the Community from the Instituto de la Cinematografía y de las Artes Audiovisuales
(Cinematographic and Audiovisual Arts Institute - ICAA) in the preceding year.

Article 19.3 of Royal Decree 2062/2008, of 12 December, implementing Law 55/2007 on
Cinema, regulates Article 36 above.

Action taken in this regard

784

General State Budget for 2008 included 2,500,000 € in the budget of the Cinematographic
and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture for this purpose. The
amount of 126,000 € was transferred to the Basque Country.

2009 General State Budget allocated 10,500,000 € to the budget of the Cinematographic
and Audiovisual Arts Institute (ICAA) of the Ministry of Culture for this purpose; the
distribution of this amount is currently being arranged, and will be distributed once the
corresponding agreements have been approved and signed by the parties.

Independently of the provisions contained in the Law on Cinema, Royal Decree 526/2002,
of 14 December, established facilities for access to aid to finance feature films for
producers with films originally in a co-official language other than Spanish. This aid has
been granted ever since 2003.

Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

The Ministry awards competitive grants. The terms and conditions applicable to these
grants indicate that they are open to all the country’s co-official languages and that their
aim is to encourage private inter-communication among the different cultures of Spain.
Representatives of business associations or regional language Academies sometimes
belong to the evaluation committees:

-

Aid to non-profit-making companies and institutions that publish cultural

periodicals written in any co-official language of Spain. The purpose of this aid is to
distribute free cultural magazines in the different official languages of Spain in Spanish
libraries and cultural centres abroad. Annual subsidised publications include
magazines published in co-official languages.

-

Aid to promote reading and the dissemination of Spanish literature, through

activities that promote common Spanish culture in both Spain and abroad through
congresses, seminars, etc., participation in and organisation of commemorations and
centenary celebrations – especially in honour of writers -, the promotion of reading and
785

the use of public libraries. Annual subsidised publications include magazines published
in co-official languages.

-

Aid for the publication of literary works in any co-official language of Spain. This

aid programme subsidises publishing projects in the country’s co-official languages ,
works of Spanish culture, of national and international projection, that help enrich our
common bibliographic heritage, with the dual purpose of increasing the resources of
public libraries in Spain and promoting and fostering cultural communication and
cohesion among the Autonomous Communities, creating common bibliographic
resources in all public libraries.

National Literature Prizes

Representatives of the respective co-official language academies participate in the
selection of the National Literature Prizes awarded by the Ministry of Culture. The terms
and conditions applicable to all the Prizes stipulate that works and authors in any of the
languages used in Spain can be nominated. Many of these Prizes have been awarded to
works written and authors writing in languages other than Spanish.

Promotion of Performing Arts and Music

In the period 2006-2008, the Directorate General for the National Institute of Performing
Arts and Music (INAEM) adopted a policy geared to stimulating expression in the coofficial languages in its aid programmes for initiatives to promote, develop and conserve
theatres and circuses and theatre and circus communication.

This is established by the resolutions of the National Institute of Performing Arts and Music
of 26 December 2005, 26 February 2007 and 8 February 2008, under which aid is
awarded to programmes to promote, develop and conserve theatres and circuses and
theatre and circus communication in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

In this sense, the established requirements for participating in the national theatre
promotion programme are more flexible if the theatre performances are only made in one
of the official languages other than Spanish. This flexibilisation consists in excluding two
786

compulsory requirements for other applicants: firstly, that planned tours must visit at least
three Autonomous Communities; and secondly, that at least 40% of performances must be
given outside the Autonomous Community in which the applicant has its registered office.

sub-paragraph b): to foster the different means of access in other languages to works
produced in regional or minority languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;

Each year the Department of Culture of the Administration of the Basque Country awards
grants for the publication of translations of literary works written originally in Basque. In
2008, a total of 22 translations were subsidised, at a cost of 77,023.84 euros.

The soundtracks of all films made originally in Basque are translated at least into Spanish.

sub-paragraph c) to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced in
other languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and
subtitling activities

Since 1990, the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy (VPL) has concluded annual
agreements with the EIZIE Association of Basque translators and interpreters for the
translation of the so-called “Literatura Unibertsala” (universal literature) collection into
Basque. Under these agreements, all the major works of world literature have been
translated into Basque (136 books).

In 2008, as in previous years, a prize of 18,000 euros was awarded by a panel of experts
to the best Basque literary translation published in book form over the preceding year.

And one of the four “Euskadi” Literary Prizes is awarded to the best translation into
Basque of a work of literature published in the previous year.

The system of grants to promote publishing in Basque includes the purchase of a
limited number of copies of each work, which are distributed to libraries in the
Autonomous Community.
787

Another annual grant programme is geared to encouraging premieres of feature films
to be dubbed or subtitled in Basque and to ensuring that video clubs, bookshops and
other commercial circuits for audiovisual productions are stocked with video cassettes
and DVDs dubbed or subtitled in Basque. Between 2006 and 2008, a total of 2,904,719
euros was earmarked to subsidise the premieres of 38 movies and the production of 70
DVDs with soundtracks in Basque.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following actions:

1. Translation of published works

The Ministry of Culture notifies annual aid for translation:

-

Aid for the translation and publication of literary or scientific works by Spanish

authors in any foreign language, written originally and published in any of the official
languages in Spain. This aid is geared to disseminating and promoting Spanish culture
abroad. This aid is open to any Spanish work written in a.

-

Aid for the translation of works written in any co-official language of Spain into

other co-official languages of Spain, originally written and published in any of the
languages in Spain. The objective is to disseminate and promote the different coofficial languages of Spanish culture in Spain. This aid is open to any Spanish work
written in a co-official language.

sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for incorporating the
knowledge and use of regional or minority languages and cultures in the undertakings
which they initiate or for which they provide backing.

The Regional Ministry of Culture of the Basque Government organises cultural
activities geared directly to guaranteeing adequate representation of the Basque
culture and language.

788

In connection with the activities which it supports, particularly in the field of cultural
dissemination, the Regional Ministry includes the use of Basque among the criteria for
granting aid under all its programmes to support and subsidise cultural projects
involving language.

The Vice-Ministry for Language Policy grants annual subsidies to private bodies for
the promotion, dissemination and normalisation of Basque in their activities, e.g.
leisure, sport and cultural activities for children and young people. A total of 1,339,000
euros was earmarked for such aid in 2009.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following actions:

1. Dissemination of information on web pages

The Ministry of Culture, the National Library and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina
Sofía offer information in the co-official languages on their respective web pages.

The National Library also has a channel on YouTube in which all videos have
transcriptions into the State’s different co-official languages.

2. Dissemination of information through other informative material

2.1 Temporary exhibitions
In the temporary exhibitions organised by the Ministry of Culture, through the
Subdirectorate General for the Promotion of Fine Arts, in national museums managed
exclusively by the Ministry in Autonomous Communities with co-official languages, room
information (information plaques, explanatory texts, etc.) and material to promote the
exhibition (brochures, posters, newspaper advertisements, etc.) are produced in the two
official languages of the Autonomous Community.
In other exhibitions staged in Autonomous Communities with co-official languages in
which the Subdirectorate General for the Promotion of Fine Arts collaborates with other
institutions, both languages are also normally used in exhibition material.

Fund to support cinematographic production in co-official languages, transfers calculated
applying the principle of co-responsibility and legally articulated through agreements with
the Autonomous Communities. In 2009, such transfers amounted to:
- Basque Country: 738,420 €

sub-paragraph e): to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organising or supporting cultural activities have at their disposal staff who have a full
command of the regional or minority language concerned, as well as of the language(s) of
the rest of the population;

Whenever public authorities in the Basque Country organise or support cultural
activities, they include, as one of the characteristics of posts within the organisation,
the so-called “linguistic profile”, which defines the command of Basque required for the
post in question.

sub-paragraph f): to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and planning cultural activities;

The public administrations of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country
adopt different measures to facilitate and encourage citizen participation in cultural
services and programmes, without these being aimed specifically at Basque-speakers.
All such activities must at least be conducted in Basque.

sub-paragraph g): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or publishing works produced
in the regional or minority languages

792

The Basque Country Libraries Network discharges this duty in connection with books
and other printed material.

The Basque Film Library discharges this duty in connection with film and video materials.

The Vice-Ministry for Language Policy collaborates in the research and normalisation of
literary production in the different varieties of Basque.

The Ministry of Culture carries out the following actions:

1. Deposit of published works

The National Library is the depositary of works published in any language in Spain.

2. Reference collections

The National Library has reference collections on different subjects in all the co-official
languages of the country.

sub-paragraph h): if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to maintaining and developing
appropriate administrative, commercial, economic, social, technical or legal terminology in
each regional or minority language.

In 2001, the VPL set up the Basque Public Terminology Bank in the “Euskalterm”
database (www.euskadi.net/euskalterm), which was developed in 1987 by UZEI
(Basque Centre for Terminology and Lexicography). Since then, the Bank has been
updated in accordance with the priorities and criteria defined by the Terminology Board
operating under the Basque Country Advisory Board, which is now the competent body
in the field of terminology.

793

In March 2006, the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy and the IVAP signed an agreement
to update and complete the EUSKALTERM Public Terminology Bank. Later, in September
of the same year, the Basque Government signed another two-year agreement with UZEI
to carry out these functions.

The contract signed with UZEI includes the following work: Dictionary of Electronics and
Micro-electronics; Data Protection Dictionary; Dictionary of Professions; Metallurgy
Dictionary; Trade and Marketing Dictionary; Dictionary of Public Finance; Occupational
Safety Dictionary; Banking Dictionary; Collective Bargaining Dictionary; Dictionary of
Administrative Terms; and an Elections Dictionary.

The Vice-Ministry of Linguistic Policy has also organised and coordinated different
technical committees during the legislature to analyse existing terminological dictionaries:
Tourism Dictionary; Furniture Dictionary; Clothes Stores Dictionary; Electricity Stores
Dictionary; Personal Image, Hairdressing and Aesthetics Dictionary; Plumbing Dictionary;
Footwear Dictionary; Environment Dictionary; Office Materials Dictionary; Hypermarket
Products Dictionary; Sports Material Dictionary; Dictionary of Shopping Centre Signs;
Image, Audiovisual and Sound Dictionary; Socio-linguistic Dictionary; Dictionary of
Professions; Dictionary of Signs and Notices; Database Dictionary; and Local
Administration Dictionary.
The Special Terminology Committee of the Advisory Board on the Basque Language has
also approved 21 dictionaries: Dictionary of Restaurants, Bars and Cafés; Dictionary of
Hypermarket Products; Dictionary of Sports Material; Dictionary of Shopping Centre Signs;
Dictionary of Office Material; Dictionary of Clothes Stores; Dictionary of Footwear;
Dictionary of Personal Image, Hairdressing and Aesthetics; Dictionary of Electricity Stores;
Dictionary of Furniture; Dictionary of Plumbing; Dictionary of Tourism; Dictionary of Signs
and Notices; Dictionary of Professions; Dictionary of Abbreviations; Dictionary of
Environment; Socio-linguistic Dictionary; Office Systems Dictionary; Dictionary on Images,
Audiovisuals and Sound; Dictionary of the Local Administration; and Dictionary of Data
Protection.
The Special Terminology Committee of the Advisory Board on the Basque Language has
analysed the International Classification of Function, Disability and Health (ICF) in relation
to terminology.
794

The Basque Government has its own Official Translation Service (IZO), which provides
translation and interpreting services in both directions between Basque and Spanish for
government departments and citizens. The Official Translation Service (IZO) is not only a
public service but also the regional agency responsible for guaranteeing the accuracy and
legal equivalence of translations between Basque and Spanish. It is also the centralising
authority responsible for co-ordinating the work of translation between Basque and
Spanish within the Administration of the Basque Autonomous Community.
As indicated previously, on 21 April 2009 the Basque Government approved Decree 88 on
the authorisation of sworn translators and interpreters. This Decree aims to regulate the
professional qualifications required for persons to work as sworn translators or interpreters
from Basque into other languages and from other languages into Basque, and to create a
register of professionals authorised to work in this profession.
Paragraph 2. In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority
languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a
regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or provide appropriate
cultural activities and facilities in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

The Basque Centres or Euskal Etxeak collaborate with HABE in the organisation of
Basque language courses, as well as activities related with Basque culture and language.

In addition to these courses, Basque language and culture classes are also provided
under an agreement signed between the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy and the
respective universities, at the Complutense University in Madrid, the University of
Valencia, the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the University of Barcelona and the
Spanish Open University (UNED).

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing their
cultural policy abroad, for regional and minority languages and the cultures they reflect.

Basque Parliament Law 3/2007, of 20 April, created the Instituto Vasco Etxepare Euskal
Institutua (Basque Institute).
•

The Etxepare Basque Institute’s main mission is to disseminate and promote the

Basque language and culture the world over. It therefore takes onboard the linguistic
and cultural work previously carried out by different Basque Government authorities,
and at the same time develops new programmes and activities in order to fulfil its
mission. It has the following specific objectives:
o

Promote worldwide the teaching, study and use of the Basque language,

respecting the contributions of all communities sharing its use, favouring and
796

fostering its international recognition and advocating all measures and actions
helping to spread and improve the quality of these activities.
o

Contribute to worldwide dissemination of the Basque culture in all its forms and

languages.
o

Bring our country's reality to groups of Basque speakers the world over and to

places where the existence of Basque communities or historical cultural or
commercial relations so advise.
•

The Regional Ministry of Culture of the Administration of the Basque Country awards
annual grants for the international promotion of Basque publications, particularly those
written in Basque; the purpose of these grants is to ensure the representation of
authors, publishers and translators at international book fairs, particularly the Frankfurt
book fair, and other promotional activities.

•

A similar annual grant is awarded to guarantee the presence at international music
festivals of composers and publishers producing pieces of music, with or without lyrics
and whether or not Basque is used.

•

Further annual grants are also provided to promote the attendance at international film
festivals of authors and producers of documentary, fictional and cartoon films with
soundtracks in Basque. Another programme aims to promote international distribution
of the best short films produced in the Autonomous Community.

•

Similarly, the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy (VPL) implements a policy of
subsidising Basque cultural agencies running programmes to publicise Basque culture
abroad.

•

The main channels used by the Department of Culture of the Basque Government to
publicise the use of Euskera abroad have involved language fairs and a new network of
language assistants in universities outside the Basque-speaking area.

The VPL has attended the most important language fairs in Europe presenting general
information on Euskera and learning from experiences of other languages: Expolangues
Paris; London Language Show; Expolingua Prague and Expolingua Berlin.

797

In recent years the VPL has participated in these fairs with the Xunta de Galicia and the
Generalitat de Catalunya, sharing stands on more than one occasion and performing joint
actions on many occasions.

The Basque language and culture Assistantship Programme was officially launched in
2005, although agreements were signed in 2003 between the Vice-Ministry for Language
Policy and Spanish and foreign universities. This programme is managed under an
agreement signed by the Basque Government with universities. Each university offers
diploma or special courses on Basque language and culture. Through the agreement, the
Vice-Ministry for Language Policy undertakes to collaborate financially in the development
of the programme and provide teaching guidance and materials.

The universities undertake to set up the necessary infrastructures for the provision of
classes, to select teachers, to ensure the programme is academically valid, to make
financial contributions and to appoint an academic supervisor to monitor the programme.
In each case, a monitoring committee is set up formed by representatives of the university
and the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy.

The number of universities participating in the Assistantship Programme has increased
during the legislature. The programme has now been implemented in various universities
in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico, Germany, Finland, Poland, Italy, Russia, the Czech Republic,
the USA and Spain. An agreement has also been signed with Stanford University to
implement the Basque language and culture programme at that university.

The Regional Ministry of Culture has signed collaboration agreements with 25 universities
in 12 countries. The essence and contents of most of these agreements are the same.
However, special programmes have also been launched:

-

The agreement with Boise State University was ratified for courses in the period

2008-2011, in order to start developing the Postgraduate Degree in Basque Studies.
Students completing these postgraduate studies will be specialised in Basque
language and culture.

-

The Centre for Basque Studies in Frankfurt offers Basque language classes and

other activities, including the following: a radio programme, conferences, a Basque798

themed library, or cultural declarations.

-

It signed the first agreement with the Spanish Open University (UNED) for the

period 2008-09. As a result, the Assistantship Programme will be available at Spanish
Open University Centre’s worldwide.

In addition to the abovementioned centres, another 40 universities have submitted
requests to introduce the Assistantship Programme in the academic programmes.

HABE is developing the Euskera Munduan project which aims to offer Basque language
classes in the Euskal Etxeak (Basque Centres). For this purpose, the Institute offer the
Basque centres financial aid, training material, teacher training and guidance. A total of 66
centres or euskal etxeak worldwide currently participate in this programme.

In 2008, a group of trainee Basque language teachers from different South American
countries participated in an on-line courses, sponsored by FEVA (Federation of Basque
Entities of Argentina) and FIVU (Federation of Basque Institutions of Uruguay).

Ministry of Culture:

1. Book fairs and the sending book consignments to cultural centres

At international book fairs where Spain either runs a national stand or instructs its
Embassies to do so, the new publications on display include books and periodicals in all
the languages used in Spain, some of them deriving from the grants awarded to book and
magazine publishers. The same applies to the book consignments sent to libraries and
cultural centres.
Spanish authors participate in international book fairs, congresses, etc. independently of
the co-official language in which they write.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation:

The Cervantes Institute has signed various collaboration agreements with different cultural
institutions to disseminate the co-official languages within the framework of foreign cultural
policy. These include academic and teaching activities with the following institutions: the
799

Ramón Llull Institute, the Royal Academy of the Basque Language-Euskaltzaindia, the
Basque Language Institute of Navarre, the Royal Galician Academy of Language and the
Secretariat of Linguistic Policy of the Xunta of Galicia.

The Cervantes Institute has been offering co-official language courses since the academic
year 1994-1995. The courses organised in recent years have evolved as follows:

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 13. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE

1. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, within the whole
country:

sub-paragraph a) to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or limiting
without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority languages in
documents relating to economic or social life, particularly contracts of employment, and in
technical documents such as instructions for the use of products or installations;

Basque legislation contains no provisions prohibiting or restricting the use of the Basque
language.

Law No. 10/1982 of 24 November 1982, on the normalisation of the use of Basque,
recognises the linguistic rights of citizens and requires the public authorities to protect
these rights. Article 4 of this law stipulates that: “The public authorities must ensure
and adopt appropriate measures to prevent anyone from suffering discrimination on
the grounds of language in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country”.
Article 26 provides that “the Basque public authorities must adopt appropriate
measures and secure the necessary means of promoting the use of Euskera in all
fields of social life so that citizens can conduct commercial, cultural, voluntary,
sporting, religious and other activities in this language”.

These articles have been implemented as follows:

1.- Promotion and subsidisation, by the public authorities, of strategies for the use of
Basque in private enterprises and public administrations.

801

The Department of Culture issued an order regulating the subsidisation of strategies to
promote the use of Basque in private companies and public institutions located in the
Basque Autonomous Community. The table below shows the trends in subsidies over the
last few years:

In 2006, the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy launched the “LanHitz” initiative to promote
the use of the Basque language in the workplace, in collaboration with the provincial
councils of Álava, Vizcaya and Guipúzcoa and EUDEL (Association of Basque
Municipalities), as well as the Regional Ministries of Industry and Employment of the
Basque Government.

Awareness-raising in companies

Companies in the Basque Autonomous Community with more than 15 workers have been
offered the opportunity to perform a basic diagnosis of the presence of Basque, as well as
to receive aid to implement Basque language plans. Special procedures and material have
been provided for this purpose.

Since the programme was launched, 800 companies from the Basque Country have held
meetings with the Vice-Ministry for Language Policy, have obtained information on the
programme and, in most cases, have also provided the information necessary for the
diagnosis.

802

Standard Reference Framework and technical resources

In 2006, a taxonomy or support table called the Standard Reference Framework (EME)
was created to help companies establish their language objectives. This Framework
defines the standard action lines of an organisation, identifying where and for what
language can be used. This Framework allows organisations that wish to implement a
Basque language plan to clearly identify their objectives and the aspects that they can
develop and improve.

Various types of aid are available to companies that decide to develop these actions:

1.Grants programme; information and guidance service; Basque literacy and teaching
sessions; LINGUANET course; diagnosis, design, monitoring and IT tools for
evaluating Basque language plans; online bank of standard forms and documents;
CRM or “Customer Relationship Management” application (freeware).

2. General Plan for the Promotion of the Use of the Basque Language The main aim
of this Plan, designed and approved by the Basque Language Advisory Board, is to
determine and promote the necessary language policy measures to ensure that
citizens who wish to live in Basque can do so. In short, it consists in intensifying actions
to support Basque in order to achieve the complete normalisation of its use in personal,
social and official spheres.

3. Decree 86/1997, of 15 April, regulating the normalisation of the use of Basque in
Public Administrations in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country. This
decree will be applied in the Public Administration, and details the consequences of the
normalisation of Basque in the public sphere.

803

consumers and users. In order to help companies undertake the difficult task of
implementing Decree 123/2008, the Basque Government distributed 600,000 euros
among 26 organisations that applied for subsidies in 2008. In 2009, an Order was also
published regulating the granting of these subsidies.

8.-

BIKAIN: Basque Language Quality Certificate. The Vice-Ministry for

Language Policy presented the BIKAIN certificate in December 2007. The aim of this
certificate is to check and certify the level of development achieved in Basque
language normalisation processes developed by socio-economic organisations in the
Basque Country.

This certificate can be obtained by organisations that are able to accredit a minimum level
of presence, use and management of Basque, in accordance with the conditions
established in a specially-designed evaluation system. There are three assessment levels,
according to the level of presence, use and management of Basque accredited by
organisations. basic certificate, silver certificate and gold certificate.

The first BIKAIN certificates were awarded on 10 November 2008. 30 companies received
these certificates, distributed as follows:
-

Basic certificate, low level: 7 entities

-

Silver certificate, middle level: 17 entities

-

Gold certificate, high level: 6 entities

804

In 2009, 27 requests were received from entities interested in applying for the annual
BIKAIN certificates.

sub-paragraph b) to prohibit the insertion in internal regulations of companies and private
documents of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of regional or minority
languages, at least between users of the same language;

See the comments relating to Article 10, paragraph 3, section a).

sub-paragraph c) to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;

As indicated previously, Law 10/1982 on the normalisation of the use of Basque
recognises citizens’ language rights and attributes obligations to public authorities vis-à-vis
the protection of these rights. Article 5 under the First Heading establishes the right to
conduct professional, industrial, political and trade union activities in Basque and the right
for citizens to express themselves in Basque at any meeting.

sub-paragraph d) to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority languages
by means other than those specified in the above sub-paragraphs.

The instrument used to promote the use of the minority language is the General Plan for
Promotion of the Use of the Basque Language, as described previously.

Paragraph 2. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, in so
far as the public authorities are competent, within the territory in which
the regional or minority languages are used, and as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a) to include in their financial and banking regulations provisions which
allow, by means of procedures compatible with commercial practice, the use of regional or

805

minority languages in drawing up payment orders (cheques, drafts, etc.) or other financial
documents, or, where appropriate, to ensure the implementation of such provisions;

Generally speaking, Article 40.1 of Law No. 6/2003 of 22 December 2003, governing
the status of consumers and users, establishes the obligations that must be fulfilled
by public establishments that sell products and provide services.

Article 10 of Decree 123/2008, on the language rights of consumers and users,
establishes the linguistic obligations that must be fulfilled in the documents of financial and
credit entities:

1.- Financial and credit entities with branches open to the public in the Autonomous
Community of the Basque Country must be able to provide customers with cheques,
promissory notes, cheque books, debit and credit cards, as well as any other similar
documents offered to them, in Basque and Spanish.
2.- Whenever these entities allow consumers and users to request the documents referred
to in the previous paragraph by electronic means, they must be in a position to issue
them in Spanish and Basque.
3.- Notwithstanding the provisions established in paragraph 1, when financial and credit
entities comply with any of the requirements established in Article 2.3, they shall be
subject to the other obligations established in this Decree.

In 2008 and 2009, various banks applied for these subsidies, as provided for in the Order
regulating subsidies for the development of the language rights of consumers and users.

In 2008, the following four banks received financial aid: Caja Laboral Euskadiko Kutxa,
Gipuzkoako Kutxa, Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa and Bankoa

In 2009, in addition to the four entities mentioned above, a further three entities received
financial aid: Banco de Sabadell, Banco Urkijo-Sabadell Banca privada, and Caja de
Ahorros y Monte de Piedad de Navarra (CAN).

Additionally, in 2007 the Basque Government signed a Collaboration Framework
Agreement to promote the use of Basque with the three main Basque banks: Bilbao
Bizkaia Kutxa, Gipuzkoa Donostia Kutxa and Caja Vital Kutxa.
806

The Basque Government has provided banks with an application for measuring the
Basque language indicators in these entities.

sub-paragraph b) in the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public
sector), to organise activities to promote the use of regional or minority languages;

Plan for the Normalisation of the Basque Language in the Basque Public Administration.
The fourth Plan is currently being implemented.

Article 38.2 of Basque Law 6/2003, on the status of consumers and users, stipulates
that, the presence of both official languages must be guaranteed in services provided
to consumers and users.

Decree 123/2008 was approved in July 2008, on the language rights of consumers of
users, in order to guarantee the language rights of consumers and users.

As regards economic and social life, within the framework of the programme of subsidies
to develop the linguistic rights of consumers and users and to help companies in their
efforts to implement Decree 123/2008. the Basque Government distributed 600,000 euros
among 26 organisations that applied for subsidies in 2008. In 2009, an Order was also
published regulating the granting of these subsidies.

Aid corresponding to 2009 was awarded under Resolution of 14 October 2009. In total,
556,952.69 euros were distributed among 25 applicant entities. The subsidised actions
were all measures established by Decree 123/2008 on the language rights of consumers
and users.

Ministry of Finance and Economy

In relation to the application of the objective established in Section II of the European
Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, which mentions the “facilitation and/or
encouragement of the use of regional or minority languages, in speech and writing, in
public and private life", and in application of Section III on the measures adopted to
807

encourage the use of these languages in public life, the Official Credit Institute (ICO) plans
to:

In the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public sector), to organise
activities to promote the use of regional or minority languages.

In order to fulfil this undertaking, since 2005 the ICO has been working to disseminate its
main lines of financing in the co-official languages. The specific actions undertaken by the
Institute have focused on translating the main contents of its web page into the co-official
languages, and on the publication of informative leaflets and posters in those languages.

sub-paragraph c) to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes
and hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in their own language persons
using a regional or minority language who are in need of care on grounds of ill-health, old
age or for other reasons;

Articles 5.2. a), 6.1 and 9.1 of Basque Basic Law 10/1982, of 24 November, on the
normalisation of the use of Basque, secure the fundamental linguistic right of conducting
relations in Basque or Spanish orally and/or in writing with the Administration and any
body or organisation established in the Autonomous Community, including the right to be
attended in the same official language.

Decree 67/2003 of 18 March 2003, regulates the normalisation of the use of Basque in
the Osakidetza (Basque Health Service) with a view to gradually incorporating Basque
into all oral and written relations between the Osakidetza and the general public in
providing health services, as well as in all the procedures governing its activity as a
public body.

sub-paragraph d) to ensure by appropriate means that safety instructions are also drawn
up in regional or minority languages;

Article 37.a) of Law 6/2003, of 22 December 2003, on the status of consumers and
users, recognises the rights of consumers and users to receive information on goods
and services in Basque and Spanish.

808

At present, there is no specific regulation governing the use of language in safety
instructions.

However, the regulations governing the language rights of consumers and users also
indirectly apply in this respect.

Article 37.a) of Law 6/2003, of 22 December 2003, on the status of consumers and
users, recognises the right of consumers and users to receive information on goods
and services in Basque and Spanish.

Chapter II of Decree 123/2008, on the language rights of consumers and users,
establishes the following linguistic obligations in written communications:

Article 5.- Linguistic obligations in written communications of public establishments.

1.- Without prejudice to the obligations corresponding to public entities by virtue of the
provisions contained in Article 38.2 of Law 6/2003, public establishments in the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country that belong to entities referred to in
Article 2.2, as well as the establishments that sell products and provide services
referred to in Article 2.3, shall formulate the following in Basque and Spanish:
a) Any type of sign, including toponymic signs, that comply with the provisions
contained in Article 10 of Basic Law 10/1982, on the normalisation of the use of
Basque.
b) Fixed and variable information contained on public posters or notices.
c) Printed material or catalogues published directly or indirectly by the company or
commercial establishment that are available to the public and that provide
information on one or various products or services.
d) Printed material intended for use by consumers and users.
e) Standard-form agreements, contracts with standard clauses, regulated contracts,
general terms and conditions and documentation referred to in the aforementioned
contracts and clauses or arising from the aforementioned contracts.
f) Communications or notifications intended for consumers and users, as well as
invoices or documents accrediting transactions, estimates, deposit receipts and any
similar documents.

809

sub-paragraph e) to arrange for information provided by the competent public authorities
concerning the rights of consumers to be made available in regional or minority languages.

In connection with this measure, mentioned must be made of two articles in Law 6/2003,
on the status of consumers and users.

“Article 14.– General principle.
1.- Consumers and users are entitled to receive reliable, complete, objective and
comprehensible information on the main characteristics of the goods and services
provided to them, with instructions on their proper use and consumption and
warnings on the foreseeable risks of their use or consumption, so that they can
make a rational, informed choice between the goods and services and use them in
a safe and satisfactory manner.”

Article 37.– Language rights of consumers and users.
In line with the provisions of the present chapter and in accordance with the gradual
nature of their implementation, consumers and users have the following language
rights:
a) The right to receive the information on goods and services stipulated in Article
14 of this law in Basque and Spanish.”

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 14. TRANSFRONTIER EXCHANGES.

The Parties undertake to:

sub-paragraph a) to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind them
with the States in which the same language is used in identical or similar form, or if
necessary to seek to conclude such agreements, in such a way as to foster contacts
between the users of the same language in the States
concerned in the fields of culture, education, information, vocational training and
permanent education;

810

As regards the promotion of appropriate forms of transfrontier exchanges, on 7 February
2007 the Basque Government and the French Basque Language Authority signed a
framework agreement to cooperate on Basque-related matters and language policy in the
period 2007-2010.

The French entity is a public-interest grouping that includes the French State, the
Aquitaine Region, the Pyrénées-Atlantiques Department Council and the town councils in
the Northern Basque Country. It was created in 2004.

Under the agreement, the parties collaborate in different areas: the transmission of
Basque, the presence and use of Basque, the quality of the language, and stimulating
interest in the language. Over the years, the following activities have been carried out as
part of this collaboration:

- Subsidy programme for private stakeholders in French: thanks to contributions from both
institutions, a cooperation fund has been created to finance the work and plans of various
private stakeholders in France in order to encourage the use of Basque. The Regional
Ministry of Culture of the Basque Government has assigned 1,380,000 € to this fund in this
three-year period. As a result, 112 projects received financial backing in 2007 and 2008. In
2009, the Regional Ministry of Culture contributed 470,000 € to this programme.

- Publication and presentation of the results of the Fourth Socio-linguistic Survey.
- Monitoring and evaluation of the system of linguistic indicators, defining and organising
common indicators.
- Exchange of information between the technical teams of both institutions on various
aspects (euskaldunización-literacy, educational system, toponyms, etc.).
- In the area of euskaldunización-literacy, the definition and organisation of the validation
of Basque language qualifications on both sides of the border.

sub-paragraph b) for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or
promote co-operation across borders, in particular between regional or local authorities in
whose territory the same language is used in identical or similar form.

811

The Basque Government encourages action to promote the use of Basque by
guaranteeing the co-operation mentioned in this sub-paragraph of the Charter.

3.4.2. ‘FORAL’ COMMUNITY OF NAVARRE

INTRODUCTION

In the context of a commitment to cooperation between autonomous communities, the
presidents of the ‘Foral’ [autonomous chartered] Community of Navarre and the
Autonomous Community of the Basque Country signed in July 2009 a general
collaboration protocol covering three specific areas: infrastructures, dissemination of ETB1 and ETB-2 services in Navarre and language policy.

Regarding the latter, the two autonomous governments considered it appropriate to
establish lines of collaboration based on institutional respect, the socio-linguistic reality of
both Communities and the powers respectively granted in the rules governing the subject
matter:

The following aspects are considered in the protocol:
•

It is noted that languages are a major element of the cultural heritage which the
Communities should work together to conserve and protect, and which for reasons of
heritage and cultural ties agreement is reached, per their respective powers, to protect
Basque;

•

Interest in exchanging experiences and information on language matters is shared,
with Basque considered a language that enriches the cultural heritage. To that end,
with a view to seeking agreements with the administration of Aquitaine, assistance
plans are agreed to for activities to promote Basque or cultural actions in Basque by
persons or entities;

•

Agreement is reached to establish ties to boost research, documentation and language
policy with a view to improving cooperation and interrelations with respect to Basque,
especially in language policy matters, where information, knowledge and coordination
will be interchanged.

812

The General Protocol establishes that the conditions for financing, organising and
implementing the specific actions will be set for each particular case in the corresponding
agreement to be signed by the respective regional ministers.

After the General Collaboration Protocol was signed various contacts were made by highlevel officials of both institutions. Among them we highlight the meeting held at the offices
of the Basque regional presidency in Vitoria.

At that meeting the administrations agreed on the desire to sign a future collaboration
agreement on the matter of language policy to promote Basque, with two main sections:
for the different administrations to establish economic funds to subsidise Basque
promotion activities conducted by different associations or bodies in Navarre and from the
other side of the Pyrenees; and to exchange information, collaboration and coordination in
certain matters of common interest. The matters established as being priorities are:
•

Basque language training for adults. The need for a basic and common curriculum in
Basque for adults was noted, at different levels of the European reference framework
from A1 to C1;

•

Accreditation of knowledge and recognition of titles issued by the other administrations.
Existing collaboration between the Governments of the Basque Country and Navarre to
issue and recognise the EGA [Basque language sufficiency] title should be extended to
the other titles and to those issued by the French authorities;

•

Technical exchanges in language policy matters;

•

Euskaltzaindia [Royal Academy of the Basque Language]. The possible signing of an
agreement between the three administrations and Euskaltzaindia was viewed
positively; it would also encompass the three Provincial Councils of Viscaya,
Guipúzcoa and Álava, which along with Navarre founded the Royal Academy of the
Basque Language 90 years ago.

Regarding training, meetings have been held with HABE (Institute for teaching literacy and
Basque to adults) to learn about its experience with respect to methodologies and
materials as well as subsidy awards. Those meetings have served to inform about the selflearning systems available at the euskaltegis [Basque language learning centres]
approved by HABE. Training personnel at the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language
and those of Zubiarte have been offered the teacher training taught in HABE. Lastly, they
813

have been provided with updated work on the curriculum being produced by Euskerabidea
in collaboration with different Navarrese experts on the subject.

These are the steps taken to date with respect to the agreement on language policy and
the meetings held with the Government of the Autonomous Community of the Basque
Country regarding this agreement. It has been announced that these will continue with a
view to developing the signed general protocol on collaboration between the autonomous
communities.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 8. TEACHING

The Committee of Experts asked the Spanish authorities to explain the negative
consequences the new model introduced by the Education Department may have for the
Basque language, as it uses English as the teaching language in 30% or 40% of classes.

The ‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language establishes three language zones in Navarre:
the Basque-speaking zone, the mixed zone and the non-Basque-speaking zone. Initially
there are three language models in Navarre: G, in which Castilian is the teaching language
and the subject is not offered in Basque; A, in which Castilian is the teaching language and
Basque is offered as a subject; and D, immersion in Basque with Castilian as a subject.
English is offered on a compulsory basis from age three and a second foreign language is
taught as an option in primary and secondary school.

Besides the G, A and D models, the Education Department currently offers the possibility
of studying in multilingual programmes with Castilian or Basque as base language.
Students in the Castilian-English programme have 10 weekly sessions in pre-school, for
875 in that period. In primary school it is 10 hours per week, for a total of 1750 hours at 11
years old. In secondary school they study English as a subject plus one or two more
subjects taught in that language. Those who chose the multilingual system with Basque as
a subject receive exactly the same number of hours in Basque as the A model currently
offers. That is, the use of English as teaching language does not affect Basque.

Starting in the 2009-2010 academic year the multilingual programme is to be offered with
Basque as teaching language. In this programme there will be fewer hours of English than
in the other programme. While in pre-school the Castilian-English programme gave a total
814

of 875, in the programme with Basque as teaching language the total will be 291. For its
part, in primary school the programme without Basque will devote a total of 1,750 hours to
English, while in the programme based on Basque the hours of English will be 1,225 until
11 years old. The aim is to ensure that in model D and in the multilingual model based on
Basque students can reach a B2 level when they finish the fourth year of ESO [obligatory
secondary education].

In the current multilingual programme in which Basque is a subject, the number of hours of
Basque is therefore the same as in model A. In the multilingual programme in which
Basque is the teaching language, the hours devoted to English are much fewer than in the
programme where Castilian is the teaching language.

Paragraph 1. With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
such languages are used, according to the situation of each of these languages, and
without prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of the State:

Measures paragraph 1:

sub-paragraph a, i): to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or
minority languages;

sub-paragraph b, i): to make available primary education in the relevant regional or
minority languages; or

sub-paragraph c, i): to make available secondary education in the relevant regional or
minority languages;

815

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that these undertakings
were fulfilled and they currently continue to be fulfilled.

The Committee of Experts requested information on whether the demand for Model D
education the Basque-speaking zone was satisfied in all cases. The response is totally
affirmative. All localities in the Basque-speaking zone which offer secondary education
offer Model D. Besides this, in the mixed zone 100% of the students who ask for
secondary education in Basque see their requests met.

Complementary information is attached on pre-school, primary and secondary education.

In the Basque-speaking zone Basque is the official language along with Castilian. Current
rules establish that the teaching of Castilian and Basque be addressed to students in all
levels, modalities and grades in public and private institutions.
Citizens can choose between teaching in Castilian with Basque as subject (Model A);
teaching in Basque with Castilian as subject and teaching language in one or two areas
(Model B); and teaching in Basque with Castilian as subject (Model D). Model G, teaching
without Basque language, is not available in the Basque-speaking zone.

General distribution in Navarre

The percentages shown in the attached table reflect the distribution in language
models of enrolled Navarrese students taking the stages, educational networks and
different language zones into account. The percentages refer to total students enrolled in
pre-school, primary, obligatory secondary [ESO] and baccalaureate education in academic
year 2007/2008.
Source: Basque Section

Model G schools a total of 53.51% of students, Models D+B 24.97% (Model B is
only taught in the Basque-speaking zone and has a very minority presence), Model A
20.08% and Model Br of English 1.44% of total students.

With respect to each of the educational stages, this distribution may be detailed as
shown below:

Curriculum of Basque language subjects

In academic year 2007-2008

the Basque Language curriculum for the

Baccalaureate stage was drawn up in accordance with Organic Law 2/2006 on Education
(LOE), taking into account the provisions of article 47 of the Organic Law on Reintegration
and Improvement of the ‘Foral’ [chartered] System of Navarre and Royal Decree
1070/1990 of 31 August, whereby the state’s duties and services in matters of nonuniversity teaching were transferred to Navarre.

The corresponding curriculums were drawn up for the subject of Basque Language
and Literature for Models D and A. A group of specialists from the Section and advisors
from the EIBZ Resource Centre for Teaching Basque worked in a group to that end.

The curriculums were coordinated in the Language Committee with the subjects of
Castilian Language and Literature and English. The curriculums were drawn up with a
view to homogenising language subjects to foster integrated treatment of same and skill
transfers among them. To that end, the Royal Decree on minimum teaching was taken into

827

account, along with Recommendation 2005/0221 of the European Parliament and of the
Commission on Key Skills for lifetime learning.

Indications from the Common European Framework of Reference for teaching,
evaluating and learning languages were also used as a basis.

Language Committee

During academic year 2007-2008 efforts concentrated on training teachers in
courses on writing and reading comprehension, as well as modules carried out in various
educational centres to orient activities for the integrated treatment of the curriculum
languages (Castilian, Basque and English) with a view to facilitating the transfer of skills in
linguistic communication.

Production of materials

In this school year the main materials published or acquired were the following:
• Araugintza.
This a book with CD containing material for two teacher training courses offered at
the EIBZ Resource Centre for Teaching Basque and follows the Basque usage standards
set by the Royal Academy of the Basque Language.
• Irakurketarekin Gozatuz.
Book with CD containing a comprehensive reading work experiment conducted at
four educational centres with Model A primary school students. The authors are four Model
A teachers who conceived and applied this innovative pedagogical experience at their
centres.
• Lenarriak VII.
Book and DVD containing work from school competitions in Literature,
Ethnography, Public Speaking, Theatre and Bertsos [extemporary composed songs]
written in the years 2007 and 2008.
The book is published biannually; its first edition received the publishing prize from the
Ministry of Education.
828

• Hitzen Kutxa: maila nagusia.
Work produced by and acquired from Cenlit publishers. This book contains various texts
from different eras of Basque literature, with comments by various authors and is
distributed in secondary schools.
• Finalists from the song contest for children and young people – Haur kantarien
jardunaldiak.
The organisers of the Haur Kantarien Jaialdiak contest financed by the Education
Department produced a DVD containing recordings of performances of finalists in the 2008
song context for children and young people; 350 copies were acquired for distribution in
educational institutions.
• Book “Ni ere bertsolari”
Within the programme dedicated to bertso compositions a student book was
published containing various didactic units with texts and discourse associated to oral
delivery: comics, radio scripts, jokes, etc. This exercise book was first applied in academic
year 2007-2008 and has received high marks from bertsolaris, teachers and students.

Three small exercise books were published which contain the work of student
groups that took part in bertso composition activities at school during academic year 20072008 in three geographic zones of Navarre: north, basin and east.
• Educational innovation experiments 2006.
This DVD contains educational innovation experiments that received awards in
2006 at the public educational institutions Ricardo Baroja of Bera, Erreniega of Zizur
Mayor and for a joint experiment conducted at the centres in Arantza, Etxalar and Igantzi.
• Brochures and informative leaflets of EIBZ programmes and website.
With the aim of publicising the Section’s programmes, various information
brochures were published:

The EIBZ Resource Centre for Teaching Basque posts on its website all published
material to ensure more use and access by teachers. It also posts the training taught in
perfecting course on CDs.
829

Technical Training

In this course the technical personnel and advisors from the Basque Section and
advisors from the EIBZ, along with some advisors from the CAPs of Pamplona and
Lekarotz, conducted various training courses. Noteworthy was the course taught by
Elhuyar Aholkularitza on the transformation processes in educational institutions.

This was a 20-hour course done in four five-hour sessions. It was taught at the EIBZ
on May 8, 15, 22 and 29.

The aim is to train trainers who work at educational institutions to establish
educational projects for school language planning.

Transportation and meal assistance

The call for applications is carried out in accordance with the principle of promoting
and fomenting Basque per ‘Foral’ Law 18/1986 of 15 December concerning the Basque
Language and established in ‘Foral’ Decree 85/1989 of 13 April. It was conducted for the
19th time in academic year 2007-2008. The application period runs from 1 to 30
September.

839

The call for applications is addressed to students who must travel because of their
language model choice, as the chosen language option is not available in their locality or
within at least 5 km of same. Transport assistance is awarded depending on the number of
kilometres involved; meal assistance depends on family income levels.

sub-paragraph d, i): to make available technical and vocational education in the relevant
regional or minority languages;

Bilingual models are determined for obligatory teaching and the baccalaureate. For
vocational training there is a group of students who receive training in a given cycle which
has no language model definition.

In most centres in the mixed and Basque-speaking zone students from the diverse
language models coexist and the teachers are able to speak both Basque and Castilian.

There are offers of cycles conducted in Basque for those professions where there is
an interest in vocational qualification in that language (see Appendix I), such as, for
example, Children’s Education, Administrative Management, Administration and Finance,
and Supervision of Physical and Sports Activities.

Offer of vocational training in Basque
Basque-speaking zone

There are three centres where vocational training is offered in the Basque-speaking
zone; in each of the three centre’s training cycles students from the diverse language
models coexist and the teachers are largely able to communicate with students in both
Basque and Castilian.
•

I.E.S. “San Miguel de Aralar II – Aralarko Mikel Dones II”, in Alsasua

•

I.E.S. “Lekaroz”, in Elizondo

•

I.E.S. “Toki Ona”, in Bera

At these centres the teachers are mostly bilingual and the teaching language used
is that of the students: Castilian or Basque.
841

In the current academic year enrolment in the cycles offered at these centres is as
follows:

not be possible due to numbers to maintain various specialty areas and might even
endanger the viability of some centres.

sub-paragraph e, iii): if, by reason of the role of the State in relation to higher education
institutions, sub-paragraphs i and ii cannot be applied, to encourage and/or allow the
provision of university or other forms of higher education in regional or minority languages or
of facilities for the study of these languages as university or higher education subjects;

In its December 2008 report the Committee of Experts considered that this
undertaking was fulfilled. It asked the authorities to provide specific information about
certain aspects of the Basque Summer University (UEU), the universities’ educational offer
in Basque and the scholarship programme for students who study in Basque at
universities in other Communities.

PUBLIC UNIVERSITY OF NAVARRE

As the Committee of Experts indicated in its report, the Public University of Navarre
(UPNA) approved on 13 March 2007 the Basque Language Strategy Plan (PEE) for the
844

2007-2009 period which includes 12 actions along the five axes contained in the Strategy
Plan of the University (training, research, persons, services and resources). These actions
include enhancing student bilingualism, producing the linguistic map of the university and
implementing vertical and transversal paths in Basque. The PEE’s aim was to achieve in
2009 the 3-2-1 model (3 subjects in first academic year, 2 in second and 1 in third). The
real offer of subjects in Basque in academic year 2008/2009 was 11 for the degree in
economics, 10 in LADE, 3 for the diploma in business administration, 11 for the diploma in
business management and legal studies, 2 in law, 2 in labour relations, 7 in agronomic
engineering, 22 in agronomic technical engineering, 11 in industrial technical engineering,
6 in industrial engineering, 6 in telecommunications t. eng., sound and image, and 2 in
computer t. eng. for management.

The UPNA increased by 50% (from 62 to 98) the number of subjects in Basque for
academic year 2009-2010. The Education Department of the Government of Navarre
bears the basic burden of the cost of offering the subjects in Basque.

Strategy Plan 2007-2009

The Public University of Navarre considers the Basque language to be an important
part of Navarrese culture and for this reason must ensure its development in line with the
Government of Navarre’s policy for prior educational levels. In each academic year
students enrol in classes who come from either bilingual educational models or those
where they acquired a general knowledge of Basque. For them, the university should
provide means allowing them to continue their studies in Basque or to have the opportunity
to improve and receive the best linguistic preparation for their professional life, given the
needs, real demands and resources.

On the other hand, the Public University of Navarre covers all Navarrese society
and must therefore provide service in accordance with the socio-linguistic reality of same.
As indicated by its statutes, overall linguistic planning must be approached bearing in mind
the parameters of demand, opportunity and above all quality from academic standpoints,
as corresponds to all university activity.

UNIVERSITY OF NAVARRE

845

At the University of Navarre there is a Language Institute as well as the Chair of
Basque Language and Culture. The Language Institute offers Basque language courses at
all levels – intensive, prolonged or for the summer. The courses are addressed to
university students, professionals and the general public with classes taught in the
Language Institute’s own classrooms and elsewhere on the university campus. The Chair
of Basque Language and Culture was established at the University of Navarre in 1963
headed by Don José Miguel de Barandiarán, who was 74 years old and lived in Ataún
when he began teaching his classes there. He did not stop giving classes until he was 90.
The Chair of Basque Language and Culture offers a full programme of cultural activities in
and about the Basque language: symposia on journalism in Basque, conferences of
writers, philologists, etc. These activities are subsidised and economically backed by the
Department of Education.

Within this Chair the Abarrots cultural group annually conducts numerous activities,
conferences and programmes. In the last year conferences were given by the writer Xabier
Zabaltza and by the president of the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, Andrés
Urrutia. Workshops on bertsos and dance were organised, as well as a bertso composing
contest. The Abarrots group receives economic support from Euskerabidea for its
activities.

The Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the University of Navarre offers the
Diploma in Basque Studies with a total of 50 credits in which 19 subjects should be taken,
several of them in Basque.

BASQUE SUMMER UNIVERSITY / UDAKO EUSKAL UNIVERTSITATEA (UEU)

The Basque Summer University offers summer courses in Pamplona. The courses
last between 10 and 20 hours and are valid at the University of the Basque Country for
free choice credits, as at the end of the courses the students are issued an attendance
certificate.

This organisation does not offer any university academic titles, as it is not legally a
university.

846

The UEU receives no financial aid from the Government of Navarre, among other
reasons because it does not request it. The year 2008 saw a “call for applications for
assistance to undertake cultural activities to develop the Basque language in Navarre”,
Resolution 11/2008 of 9 May. This organisation did not apply for aid.

All the summer course programmes of the Navarrese universities which are
financed by the Department of Education include courses taught entirely in Basque.
Specifically, this year a course in Basque has been programmed which will be taught
jointly by the Public University of Navarre and the University of Navarre.

SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

The Department of Education of the Government of Navarre annually awards
university level scholarships. The grants corresponding to academic year 2008/09 were
governed by Resolution 234/2008 of 1 July of the Directorate General of Inspection and
Services, approving the General Call for Applications for Scholarships for Academic Year
2008/2009

at

intermediate

and

university

levels

(http://www.navarra.es/home_es/Actualidad/BON/Boletines/2008/105/Anuncio-14/).

All Navarrese students who wish to begin or continue their university studies in a
specialty taught in Basque which does not exist in the ‘Foral’ Community are eligible for a
scholarship through this call for applications by the Department of Education and as long
as the academic and economic requirements established in same are met.

According to Department of Education data, the scholarships granted to students
who attended the Public University of the Basque Country (UPV) during the last three
academic years are broken down as follows:

sub-paragraph f, i): to arrange for the provision of adult and continuing education courses
which are taught mainly or wholly in the regional or minority languages;

Paragraph g: to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the culture
which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

The ‘foral’ decrees which establish Navarre’s curriculums for different stages of nonuniversity teaching assure that history and culture are taught in the Basque language.
Among the principles grounding their preparation are the following:

-

Coordination of the curriculum’s language areas by integrated treatment of the
languages;

-

Navarre’s linguistic uniqueness via the different language models for all stages;

-

Knowledge of the geographic, historic and cultural diversity of Navarre, respect for
its differences and esteem for its natural and artistic heritage.

849

The curriculum includes the basic skills, objectives, content and evaluation criteria. Its
scope of application covers all public, private and subsidised private institutions in the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre.

The curriculum sets as a goal in all stages “knowledge of the geography and history of
Navarre and the diversity of languages, cultures and customs which make it unique”; the
degree of knowledge is determined by the students’ education level and maturity.

The different areas and subject matter (Basque language and literature, knowledge of the
social, cultural and natural environment, artistic education, music, geography and history,
etc) contribute in different degrees towards accomplishing this goal.
Artículo 2.

As an illustrative example we list the content concerning the ‘Foral’ Community in the area
of knowledge of the natural, social and cultural environment in primary education and in
the subject matters of social sciences, geography and history in secondary education.
•

Knowledge of the natural, social and cultural environment
Bloc 8. The ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre:
- Unity in diversity:
- Main landscape zones: mountain, middle region and river;
- The natural parks of Navarre: Señorío de Bértiz, Urbasa-Andía Mountains and
Bardenas Reales;
- Find information in the school library on some of the animals and plants
characteristic of Navarre’s geographic regions.
- Signs of identity:
- Patron saint festivals in Navarre:
- The festivals of St Fermin: main figures, traditions and festive acts;
- The festival of the locality in question.

•

Social Sciences, Geography and History (second course)

The specific contents on The ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre are included in the
corresponding thematic blocs. The content for physical, human and economic
geography, along with sociological content, is grouped under Unity in diversity and
850

those for history under Main historical events. The section on Signs of identity deals
with singular aspects setting the Autonomous Community apart from the others. In
Artistic heritage content is presented on art in Navarre and students are expected to
actively participate in the learning process by autonomously using information
sources and producing individual or group projects or reports using resources from
the school library, paying special attention to the artistic heritage of the area where
they live.

Bloc 1. Common content
Recognition of basic elements characterising the artistic styles and interpretation of
significant works considered in their context. Evaluation of the Spanish and
Navarrese cultural and artistic heritage as wealth to be maintained and to collaborate
on its preservation.

Bloc 2. Population and society
Unity in diversity:
• The Navarrese population: evolution and population distribution; characteristics;
birth and death rates; migratory movements;
• The Navarrese rural and urban environment: the rural environment (humid
northwestern Navarre, Navarre Pyrenees and the middle zone and river zone); the
urban environment (structure of cities and urban network of Navarre);
• The Basque language: origin; Navarrese dialects; some Navarrese place names
and their meaning;
• The folklore and traditions of Navarre: folk music (the jota and folk songs in
Basque); traditional dances (the jota, the dance of Era de Estella, the Paloteado of
Cortes, the Bolantes of Valcarlos, the multidantza baztanesa, the expatadantzaris of
Lesaka,

the

Zanpantzar of Ituren, etc). Sanctuaries, processions and pilgrimages with tradition
(Ujué, San Miguel de Aralar, the javierada, Our Lady of Codés, the Tribute of the
Three Cows, Musquilda, etc.). Legends (the sorgina witches, Don Teodosio de Goñi,
the Song of Roland, the mystery of St Guillén and St Felicia in Obanos, the Moor’s
cave in Fitero, etc).

Block 3. The pre-industrial societies. The Middle Ages and the Modern Age
Main historical events of Navarre:
851

• Christianity. The Visigoths. The Muslims. History of the Kingdom of Navarre. The
Kingdom of Pamplona. The Kingdom of Navarre. Navarrese society in the Middle
Ages. The French dynasties. The end of a story (1515). The Modern Age (16th and
17th centuries).
– The Navarrese artistic heritage:

Navarrese Baroque art, using school library resources (encyclopaedias, monographs,
websites, etc): the Recollects monastery in Pamplona; St Anne’s chapel in Tudela
cathedral; St Gregory Ostiense in Sorlada; other examples from the region.

The Government of Navarre has published diverse material to complement the curriculum.
For example, the “Chipi-Txapa, conocer Navarra” collection aims to teach the
Community’s students about the physical and cultural diversity of Navarre in all its extent:
landscape, history, notable people, languages, traditions, cooking, culture, etc, so that
wherever they are the students will feel that they pertain to this wealth. It is published in
Castilian and Basque.

Bodies such as the Euskerabidea-Navarre Institute of the Basque Language, a
dependency of the Government of Navarre, have also organised activities to promote
cultural knowledge in Basque. In 2009, for example, a cycle of 31 conferences in Basque
and Castilian was promoted jointly with the Navarre Atheneum and with collaboration from
local bodies and the EIRE association of university professors.

852

They focused on two quite different topics: “Navarre and the Basque language”
(conferences in Castilian), and “Science, technology, crisis and communication”
(conferences in Basque). The former aimed to raise awareness about the Basque
language and its culture, while the latter showcased various aspects associated to
sciences and new technologies.

By means of this initiative, the Navarre Institute of the Basque Language aimed to fulfil the
goal of promoting, supporting and organising programmes and activities that encourage
the development of Basque in Navarre in collaboration with local bodies, through artistic
and cultural manifestations.

The programme included conferences in Castilian with titles such as “Oral and Written
Culture in Medieval Navarre”, “Animal Names: beliefs and superstitions”, “Basque
Language Culture and Navarre’s Ribera”, “The Royal Academy of the Basque
Language/Euskaltzaindia” and “The Basque/Romance Binomial from the Historical
Viewpoint”.

paragraph h: to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to implement
those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;

The amounts laid out annually by the Government of Navarre to subsidise the euskaltegis
[Basque language centres] corresponds to the quantities which the Parliament of Navarre,
an institution representing the will of the Navarrese people, annually approves by means of
the ‘Foral’ Law on Budgets, whereby the administration grants the aid authorised by the
Parliament.

Note that the amount has increased significantly in recent years; for 2010 the envisaged
figure is €394.381.

Regarding financial aid granted by the Navarrese authorities for further training of Basque
language teachers, we note that there are two measures used by the Education
Department of the Government of Navarre to ensure further training of Basque language
teachers. First, via the EIBZ Resource Centre for Teacher Training, entirely devoted to
853

training Basque-speaking teachers, courses are offered to recycle teachers; second, the
Education Department grants economic aid addressed to teachers who cannot attend the
specific courses for them at the EIBZ headquarters. If they cannot travel to the EIBZ, they
receive aid to attend other euskaltegis.

In the table below we see the growth in the number of teachers who are EIBZ students
and the parallel and consequent decline in the number of teachers who receive aid for
other euskaltegis. The sum of participants in recycling courses offered by the EIBZ or
private euskaltegis has tended to rise. The figure increased from 92-94 in 2001-02 and
2002-03 to 99 and 123 in academic years 2004-05 and 2005-06.

The “Pact to Improve the Quality of Public Teaching in Navarre – 2007-2011” signed by
the Education Department of the Government of Navarre and the unions represented in
the education sector is currently in force.

Point 2 of the agreement indicates that the Department of Education, together with the
undersigned union organisations, will produce a training programme with two fundamental
objectives:

To meet training needs deriving from implementation of the new curriculums and, in
general, from the measure taken to further development of the new Organic Education
Law for all teaching;

To meet training needs arising from the work of teaching teams at the institutions
themselves, with a special focus on educational innovation, new technologies, modern
languages, coexistence, attention to diversity, Basque language training and tutorship with
families.

It continues: “The recycling course can annually admit up to 10 teachers at the threshold
level. These intensive recycling courses in Basque are open to teachers with more than
854

five years in definitive assignments, with priority given to those holding positions in the
Basque language and mixed zones and/or who may be reduced due to lack of teaching
burden as a consequence of development of the language models or reorganisation of the
education offered. The maximum time spent in these courses is two academic years and
whenever suitable progress is verified in the learning.

Teachers contracted temporarily can take part in the recycling courses up to a maximum
of 10 places per year”.

The agreement has been fulfilled in this section, to the point that more places than
stipulated have been offered.

sub-paragraph i: to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing the teaching of
regional or minority languages and for drawing up periodic reports of their findings, which
will be made public.

Paragraph 2: With regard to education and in respect of territories other than those in which
the regional or minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the appropriate stages of education.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 9. JUSTICE

Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which the
number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies the measures
specified below, according to the situation of each of these languages and on condition that
the use of the facilities afforded by the present paragraph is not considered by the judge to
hamper the proper administration of justice:

855

a) in criminal proceedings:
sub-paragraph a.i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph a, ii): to guarantee the accused the right to use his/her regional or minority
language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iii): to provide that requests and evidence, whether written or oral, shall
not be considered inadmissible solely because they are formulated in a regional or minority
language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iv): to produce, on request, documents connected with legal proceedings
in the relevant regional or minority language, if necessary by the use of interpreters and
translations involving no extra expense for the persons concerned;

b) in civil proceedings:
sub-paragraph b, i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or
sub-paragraph b, ii): to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court,
that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring
additional expense; and/or
sub-paragraph b, iii): to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

c) in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
sub-paragraph c, i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or
sub-paragraph c, ii): to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court,
that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring
additional expense; and/or

856

sub-paragraph c, iii): to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

paragraph d: to take steps to ensure that the application of sub-paragraphs i and iii of
paragraphs b and c above and any necessary use of interpreters and translations does not
involve extra expense for the persons concerned.

The Committee of experts considered that the undertakings corresponding to the
distinct sub-paragraphs of paragraph 1 of article 9 of the Charter were partly fulfilled.

In the internal distribution of powers, that corresponding to the administration of
justice corresponds to the State, along with the respective commercial, criminal and
procedural law. The Autonomous Communities which have their own civil law, such as
Navarre, are nevertheless acknowledged to have the power to maintain, amend and
develop same.

On the other hand, and in accordance with article 117 of the Constitution, justice is
administered by judges and magistrates integrating the judicial power who are
independent, with fixed tenure, accountable and only subject to the rule of law.

To that end, the Constitution creates a body to govern judicial power whose
composition and action are independent of the executive power, the General Council of
the Judicial Power, which is responsible for appointments, promotions, inspection and
discipline.

In this system of distribution of responsibilities, the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre
has the power to equip the administrative and material services needed to carry out the
jurisdictional function.

The Government of Navarre has contracted a translation and interpretation service
to provide assistance to judicial bodies. Demand for this translation and interpretation
service has continually grown in recent years. This service is likewise provided to the
police and to a lesser extent in the Pamplona Penitentiary, per request from the LegalPenitentiary Orientation Service of the Pamplona Association of Lawyers. The company
857

adjudicated this service provides translations and interpreting from Basque to Castilian
and vice versa. The service is provided as scheduled or on the basis of urgency.

The amounts which the Government of Navarre has dedicated to the translation and
interpretation service were €110,000 in 2006, €142,000 in 2007 and €157,000 in 2008.
The successively extended contract was first awarded in 2005 and remains in effect; plans
call for it to be put up for tender again in 2010.

In the last year the translation and interpretation service carried out 869 interpreting
tasks and a total of 261 translations.

With this translation and interpretation service the Government of Navarre has
taken material steps to ensure compliance with the undertakings incumbent upon the
Spanish authorities in article 9. In no case is the cost of the translation and interpretation
service assumed by the parties involved in judicial proceedings; it is rather the
Government of Navarre that entirely assumes those costs.

This translation service serves to guarantee the accused or one of the parties in
litigation the right to express themselves before a court in their regional or minority
language. It also serves to assure that written or oral claims and evidence are not
disallowed solely for being presented in Basque. It also permits the judicial documents
requested by the parties to be written in Basque, without the interested parties incurring
any additional expense.

In any case, the judicial bodies’ staff who if requested by the parties can undertake
to carry out the proceedings in Basque are the judges and magistrates and judicial
secretaries.

It must be noted that the intervention of a translator/interpreter results in the loss of
immediacy in oral proceedings and lengthier proceedings with respect to written material.

In the current legal framework the power to fulfil the three first recommendations of
the Committee of Experts corresponds to the State.

858

Regarding the possibility to act with respect to the fourth recommendation of the
Committee of Experts, to increase the percentage of Basque-speakers in the
administration of justice in Navarre, the reference to judges, judicial and fiscal secretaries
(for whom the State is responsible) must be differentiated from the remaining personnel
responsible for administering justice, for whom the institutions of the ‘Foral’ Community of
Navarre are responsible.

When the Recommendation from the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on
application of the Charter in Spain was approved in December 2008, the Basque language
was not rated a merit for the vast majority of employment positions in the justice
administration of Navarre. In the first quarter of 2009 the Government of Navarre approved
consideration of the draft ‘Foral’ Decree on indication in the organisational structure of the
administration of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and its autonomous bodies regarding
how Basque language knowledge should be treated in the scale of merits used for hiring
and assigning employees; it was to be forwarded to the Council of Navarre for same to
prepare the mandatory report prior to its definitive approval by the Government.

The ‘Foral’ Decree enables Basque language knowledge to be rated at 6 percent for
all positions in Basque-speaking zone, with respect to total points assigned to all merits
whenever knowledge of said language is not a job requirement. In the mixed zone, where
nearly 80% of the administration’s jobs are located, the minimum rating will be 3 percent.
Beyond these minimum 6% or 3% ratings depending on the zone, a list of jobs involving
more public attendance was drawn up, which includes administrative and auxiliary
administrative positions, etc, in which those percentages rise to 10% or 5%, respectively.

Therefore, while the Basque language is not nowadays considered a merit in any
position in the administration of justice, in the future it will be valued at 5% in more than
half of positions and at 10% in the Basque-speaking zone.

Approval of the ‘Foral’ Decree, along with other measures, will help increase the
percentage of personnel in Navarre’s justice administration who can use Basque as a
working language in the courts.

Note that Basque-speakers currently make up part of the staff of Narrave’s justice
administration in positions where Basque is not mandatory. For this reason, the
859

Government of Navarre via Euskerabidea is preparing a campaign called “Basquez ere
bai” (also in Basque), which serves to identify the Basque-speaking people who work in
the justice administration who so desire.

Regarding the last recommendation from the Committee of Experts concerning the
establishment of training programmes for staff of Navarre’s justice administration and for
lawyers, the Government of Navarre has taken various steps in that regard. On the one
hand, the Government of Navarre via the Navarrese Institute of Public Administration
offers extensive, intensive, part-time, tutored self-learning, in-house, review and
improvement of oral expression, intensive EGA [Basque language title] preparation and
technical courses, etc, to help Navarre justice administration personnel learn the Basque
language. Besides the general call for applications for the 2009-2010 course, the
Navarrese Institute of Public Administration along with Euskerabidea is examing the
possibilities of holding certain training actions at different Navarrese judicial offices with a
view to improving attendance. Lastly, Euskerabidea subsidises private bodies offering
Basque classes in Navarre. These can be attended by all employees of Navarre’s justice
administration, including judges, magistrates, judicial secretaries, attorneys, lawyers and
prosecutors, who may also apply for grants to partly cover the cost of enrolling in Basque
courses taught by private bodies in Navarre.

Euskerabidea has also made a number of contacts with the Official Association of
Lawyers of the Basque Country to ascertain the different resources lawyers have at their
disposal for working in Basque. These contacts led to a meeting with directors of the
Official Association of Lawyers of Navarre, who were informed that any lawyer registered
in Navarre’s association who so desires can freely and at no cost use the resources for
working in Basque used by lawyers in the Basque country. The Department of Justice of
the Basque Country was also contacted and agreement reached for a working session to
learn about Epainet, the computer application created to encourage use of the Basque
language in magistrates’ courts.

Noteworthy is that all magistrates’ courts in Navarre have implemented the
INFOREG application for applications and issuance of birth, marriage and death
certificates. At present, interested parties can choose whether they want the certificate in
Castilian or Basque at 267 magistrates’ courts.

860

All Navarre justice administration employees are able to freely use the
Basque/Castilian terminology dictionary on the Intranet of the Government of Navarre.
They can also on specific occasions make consultations via an email address for any
urgent translation.

Paragraph 2: The Parties undertake:
sub-paragraph a: not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State
solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority language;

The report from the Committee of Experts indicated that among other sub-paragraphs no
comments were made on paragraph 2 of article 9, given that in the first evaluation report
no major problems were noted and the Committee of Experts had received no new
information that would require a re-evaluation of its application.

Legal documents drawn up in Basque are in no way hindered from being
considered legal and valid for all purposes. The regulatory rules have not changed since
the previous report.

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to make available in the regional or minority languages
the most important national statutory texts and those relating particularly to users of these
languages, unless they are otherwise provided.

The report from the Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking was partly
fulfilled and encouraged the authorities to continue making efforts to improve the current
situation.

The Government of Navarre publishes the Official Gazette of Navarre [BON] in
Castilian and simultaneously in Basque. There is no delay whatsoever in publishing those
versions. Article 7 of the ‘Foral’ Law on Basque states that “the ‘Official Gazette of
861

Navarre’ and the ‘Official Gazette of the Parliament of Navarre’ are published in Castilian
and Basque, in separate and simultaneous editions”, and this legal precept has been
scrupulously observed. The Government’s aim is for the BON to be published in entirely in
Basque by the end of the legislative term, including notices from the State administration,
justice administration and other official announcements. To that end, beyond the work
carried out by the Translation Service of the Department of the Presidency, Justice and
Interior, a budget outlay has been set aside, which has notably increased from €30,000 in
2007 to €180,000 last year in 2008.

The Official Gazette of Navarre began publishing in Basque 10 years ago, whereby
at least Navarrese legislation from the last 10 years is available in Basque. Since 2001 the
BON’s text in both Basque and Castilian has been posted on the Internet.

The Government of Navarre has made a major personnel and staff effort to ensure
that all Navarrese regulation is freely accessible in Basque to Basque-speakers by posting
the Official Gazette of Navarre, the Official Gazette of the Parliament of Navarre and soon
all Navarrese legislation on the Internet.

The Institute of Basque Studies Institute of the University of Deusto has a
Castilian/Basque Bilingual Legal Library which can be consulted free of charge on the
Internet. In PDF format it has a broad range of legal texts translated into Basque by the
Institute of Basque Studies and the Official Translation Service of IVAP [Basque Public
Administration Institute] autonomous body of the Basque Government.

Navarrese

Basque-speakers can access the principal state legal texts via that Bilingual Legal Library,
which posts texts on civil, criminal, procedural, commercial, constitutional, administrative
and labour law.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 10. ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC
SERVICES.

Paragraph 1. Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number of
residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the measures specified
below and according to the situation of each language, the Parties undertake, as far as this
is reasonably possible:
862

sub-paragraph a, i): to ensure that the administrative authorities use the regional or
minority languages;

MINISTRY OF THE PRESIDENCY:
• standardised forms available to citizens in bilingual or co-official language
versions

The Government Delegation in Navarre has 5 standardised printed forms, of which 2 are
bilingual, or 40%. It also as 5 models for printed institutional material, of which 3 are
bilingual, or 60%.

Regarding the General Mutual of State Civil Servants (MUFACE), 100% of the standardised
application and provision forms associated to the mutual’s own material is available in all the
co-official languages via its website.

• institutional printed material available to citizens in bilingual or co-official
language versions

The State Agency for Evaluating Public Policies and the Quality of Services (AEVAL)
published a brochure detailing its Institutional Presentation in 2007. A thousand copies were
made in each of the co-official languages; the versions were also posted on the website.

The Official State Gazete published the Spanish Constitution in Basque in 2007.

The Sociological Research Centre (CIS) puts out 12.5% of its brochures for surveys (around
5,000) in Basque.

The General Mutual of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) will issue 10 publications in Basque
in 2010. It also produces information brochures concerning issues associated to its activity,
which are published in Castilian and in the co-official languages. These publications are
863

issued in print and electronic format posted on the MUFACE website. The usual print runs
for these publications to date were:
•

900.000 copies in Castilian;

•

2.000 copies in Basque.

There is currently an ongoing process to reorganise the Magazine of the General Mutual of
State Civil Servants which will lead to a significant reduction in the number of copies printed,
while enhancing the electronic version. For 2010 the publications plan includes copies of all
the Spanish co-official languages. Examples of the envisaged topics (both in print and
online) include:
• Diptych of the electronic services chart (60,000 in Castilian and 2,000 in Basque);
• Quadriptych of the services chart of the General Mutual of State Civil Servants (20,000 in
all languages, 550,000 in Castilian and 2,000 in Basque);
• The commitment of the General Mutual of State Civil Servants to prevention and care
regarding dependence (500,000 in Castilian and 2,000 in Basque);
• Improved disability benefits (500,000 in Castilian and 2,000 in Basque);
• Health assistance for mutual members abroad (500,000 in Castilian and 2,000 in Basque);
• Pharmaceutical provision of mutual members (publication and number of copies to be
confirmed).

The Directorate General for Boosting Electronic Administration issued the latest issue of
060.es publicity brochures in a multilingual version (all brochures in the co-official
languages), with a print run of 20,000 copies.

The Publications Centre of the Ministry of the Presidency has published the following works
in co-official languages:

-

Basque and Castilian – the “Ventana económica=Ekonomi Lehioa” in 2009.

• exterior and interior signs in bilingual or co-official language versions

864

There are 13 examples of signage at the Navarre Government Delegation, of which 7 are
bilingual, or 54%.
• information or publicity signs in bilingual or co-official language versions
There are a total of 95 posters in the Delegation of the Government of Navarre (including
those pertaining to the Local Investment Fund for publicising work in town halls); 32 are
bilingual, or 33.68%.
• publicity campaigns in bilingual or co-official language versions
In compliance with Law 29/2005, which provides that “In institutional campaigns Castilian
shall be used, and, depending on the territorial scope of dissemination, the co-official
languages of the Autonomous Communities, respecting the legislation of the respective
Autonomous Community on the use of official languages”, some of the institutional
campaigns promoted by the Ministry of the Presidency and its public bodies have used coofficial languages.

The General Mutual of State Civil Servants (MUFACE) publishes printed institutional
material associated to publicity campaigns in the co-official languages.

• degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages
The pages on the portal 060.es (www.060.es) are available in the different co-official
languages. That website presents the home page, secondary page and all elements needed
for browsing (except the heading, secondary page menus and left and right side menus) in
the co-official languages. The new 060 portal will have an identical structure; plans call for
the gradual translation of content into the co-official languages and English.

On the www.la-moncloa.es website the permanent information, statistics, menus, submenus and titles are translated.

On the website www.mpr.es, the permanent information, statistics, menus, sub-menus and
titles are translated until the first level of navigation.
865

At the State Agency for Evaluating Public Policies and the Quality of Services, the degree of
accessibility is total, meaning there is a duplicated website for each of the co-official
languages, with independent home page. Regarding the content:

- All statistical information is translated (menus, sub-menus, titles...);
- The sections associated to institutional information and of a theoretical or doctrinal
nature on matters subject to the Agency’s activity are translated until the last level of
navigation (40% of total pages);
- Mixed translation (first level in co-official language and following ones in Castilian) in
those which have a variable part that appears periodically (quality permission, annual
evaluations...) – 30% of total pages;
- All the pages associated to continually updated News, Events or Announcements are not
translated into co-official languages – 30% of total pages.

Regarding the Official State Gazette (BOE), all the webpages of boe.es are translated into
the co-official languages.

The Centre for Political and Constitutional Studies (CEPC) is in the process of adapting
the website by translating statistical and organisational information into the co-official
languages, along with other content of interest.

The following are translated into the co-official languages on the website of the
Sociological Research Centre (CIS):
•

All navigation pages in HTML;

•

The application forms which are complemented from the website, but not the validated
ones to be printed and submitted;

•

The form for downloading microdata.

Regarding the website of the National Institute of Public Administrations (INAP), as the
information provided is valid for only a short time (due to its rapid generation) and the
translation of same is done by contracting specialised agencies for it to be done in the
official languages of Castilian and English, the content in languages other than Castilian is

866

limited to the permanent information on the website (names of the different website
channels) and the headings indicated on the home page.

The Genereal Mutual of State Civil Servants is currently in the process of changing its
webpage. The new one should soon be operational. The current circumstances are
described, as well as the new website:

Current website. The level of total translation of the static website (excluding electronic
services, under the generic name of “General Mutual of State Civil Servants-direct”) is
approximately 55-60%. This means that the first and second navigation levels are almost
entirely translated, but from the third level on it is only in Castilian. Institutional information
is almost entirely translated (around 97%). About 95% of downloadable printed forms are
translated.

The new website will become operational in 2010. The static website will be 80%
translated. Electronic services will only be in Castilian. Coverage in the other co-official
languages will be completed over the course of 2010.

The following elements are translated on the website of the National Heritage body:
•

Language change menu;

•

Upper menu with portal’s main areas;

•

Complementary menu (site map, contacts, etc).

• requests received in co-official languages
INAP has received no requests in co-official languages, though should this occur it is
prepared to answer those requests in the co-official language used in same.

Information requests received in a co-official language in the Central Services of the
General Mutual of State Civil Servants are answered in Castilian. Regarding use of the coofficial languages in requests for benefits from the mutual members from the survey of the
most recent available data, the following information and conclusions are drawn:
867

Very few of the writings which entered the General Registry of the Council of
Administration of the National Heritage in 2009 were received in Basque. They referred to
bilingual notifications or official letters on the payment of fees and fines from administrative
proceedings or instances. All were registered in Castilian.

Requests received by the Office of Conflict of Interests are always received in Castilian,
the language in which they are answered. Requests are occasionally accompanied by
copies of a document written in a co-official language.

the co-official languages.

The translation into co-official languages on the ministry’s website (www.mityc.es) is until
the second level, i.e., the homepage and the pages linked to it are translated, which is
considered to provide a comprehensive idea of this website’s content. Translated to a
further level are the section on “The Ministry”, deemed to be of organisational interest, or
the list of “Processes Online” shown in the website’s search engine to bring the
procedures managed by the department closer to citizens.

• degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages
It is currently possible to access the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
Cooperation in co-official languages in all the homepage channels, as well as in the titles
of all sub-channels. These contain fixed information; plans call for this facility to be
extended to other kinds of content as far as enabled by budget outlays.

Regarding website content, only the “Ministry” channel is entirely translated into Basque.
As for citizens’ right to electronic use of the co-official languages of the State in their
electronic correspondence with the General State Administration, in accordance with Law
11/2007, as procedures are eventually included in the website they will also appear in the
channels for those languages.

877

Regarding the Cervantes Institute, noteworthy is the inclusion on its website (in the
“Linguistic Technologies in Spain Portal”) of a free automatic translation service in various
languages, among them the co-official languages into Spanish, and a link on the
homepage to the “Official Languages of Spain” which accesses other web pages
associated to the co-official languages in Spain.

The Cervantes Institute has pledged to study during this year of 2010 the possibility of
setting a calendar schedule for the information on its website menus to be offered in the
different co-official languages of Spain.

• institutional printed material available to citizens in bilingual or co-official
language versions

The Sub-directorate General for Publications, Information and Documentation of the
Ministry has published a total of 62 different document forms, of which 2 are translated into
co-official languages: 2 into Basque.

Regarding the archives, 100% of printed institutional material is bilingual or in co-official
language at the disposal of citizens. It also supplies exhibition catalogues in the co-official
language of the Autonomous Community – in some cases this is a summary and in others
the complete text.

The Prado National Museum annually publishes the Museum’s guides in Castilian and six
foreign languages, as well as in Basque (2,500 units).

Plans also call for the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía to publish in 2010 the
information brochures with the Museum’s guides in the different co-official languages.

Regarding the Collective Catalogue of Bibliographical Heritage, a system to manage that
catalogue’s database was contracted. It envisages a multi-lingual application able to
manage information access via the access points for bibliographic records in any of the
State’s languages. The system allows a term from any of these languages to be entered
and, if the corresponding lists are in standard format, to obtain the information, including its
equivalents. This will enable establishment of what in library terms is called a multilanguage authorities file, as well as a thesaurus with the same features. These facilities
can be used via the Internet, as well as at libraries where installed.
• exterior and interior signs in bilingual or co-official language versions

880

The signage in archives pertaining to the Ministry of Culture and situated in Autonomous
Communities with co-official language is 100% bilingual or in co-official language.
• information or publicity signs in bilingual or co-official language versions
The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía is equipped with 11 plasma screens
inside the building which show information in co-official languages. As indicated above, in
2010 the information brochures with the museum’s guides will be published in the coofficial languages.
• publicity campaigns in bilingual or co-official language versions
The Plan to Encourage Reading is conducted in Castilian and in the co-official languages:

-

In 2006 a 2.5 million euro television and cinema publicity campaign was conducted.
The text and voice were in Castilian and the co-official languages. Shirts promoting the
campaign were also distributed in those languages;

-

In 2007 a publicity television and cinema campaign was again conducted, for
2,400,000 euros, in Castilian and the co-official languages. Shirts for the campaign
were likewise made;

-

In 2008 and 2009 the campaign was conducted solely in Castilian. However, in 2008
shirts for the campaign were made in co-official languages.

On the other hand, 2010 saw publication for the first time of the calendar for disseminating
documentary resources of the State Archives in the State’s co-official languages.

The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía conducted a bilingual publicity campaign
in co-official languages. The new distribution of the museum’s collection, inaugurated in
May 2009, was publicised via a state radio campaign produced in the respective language
in the Autonomous Communities with co-official language.
• Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages

881

Some 44% of all pages on the Ministry of Culture’s website are translated into the coofficial languages, on average up to the fourth level. Downloadable documents are not
translated.

Noteworthy among the services offered by the Ministry of Culture due to its interactivity in
co-official

languages

is

the

so-called

“Pregunte”

[Ask]:

the

libraries

answer

(http://www.pregunte.es/consulta/consulta.cmd), enabling any web surfer to seek or ask
for information via Internet – the query will be answered by professional librarians via email
within three days. Consultations and requests for information can be made in any of the
State’s co-official languages; the answers to those requests are in the language in which
they were submitted.

On the other hand, the websites of the digital library projects stimulated and implemented
by the Ministry of Culture are translated into all the co-official languages of the Spanish
State. For example, the Virtual Library of Bibliographic Heritage allows access to
information via multilingual headers containing description of content and names of
authors or institutions in the distinct languages of the Spanish State.

Plans likewise call for archive descriptions to be available in the co-official languages in
the future. This challenge will be very gradually assumed, beginning with descriptions of
the archives located in the Basque Country.

On the other hand, among the services the Ministry of Culture offers for public libraries is
the website headquarters generator for libraries, a tool enabling librarians to arrange their
library websites. It does not require computer knowledge and there are no language limits.
The libraries of the Autonomous Communities’ with two official languages can thus offer
their content in both languages.

With respect to stage arts and music, in the sections corresponding to the Ministry’s
website and at those of the respective artistic creation centres there is the possibility of
accessing the directories in the co-official languages. Also, the new websites at various
creative centres of the National Institute of Stage Arts and Music will present information in
the co-official languages.

882

In the websites of museums managed by the Ministry of Culture, the co-official languages
of the Autonomous Communities began to be included in 2009. In that year the contents
and static content of the ARQUA National Museum of Underwater Archaeology were
translated into Galician, Catalan, Valencian and Basque. The websites of the National
College of San Gregorio Museum in Valladolid and the National Museum of Romanticism
in Madrid will soon be brought into line. The aim is for those languages to be included
when other museums’ websites are likewise updated.

As for the Prado Museum, the website’s online visit is translated into the co-official
languages, with the following content: schedule and prices, groups, services and
recommendations, accesses and maps. Also translated into the same languages is the
section on 15 Masterworks with the contents of the selection of 15 works from the
Museum, technical data and explanatory text.

The degree of web accessibility in the co-official languages of the Museo Nacional Centro
de Arte Reina Sofía is 44.5%. This website (www.museoreinasofia.es) has nine sections,
four of which (Visit, Museum, Collection and Library) are offered to users in the co-official
languages.

The National Library of Spain undertook a project to rework its institutional website in May
2009. The new website is conceived to be a single multi-language portal where users can
select the navigation language. This means that the portal’s structure is identical for any
language; the aim is to show all content in Spain’s official language, Castilian, and in the
co-official languages.

The Library also plans to implement in late 2010 a platform that will enable it to offer a
translation system on its website and to follow up on all work requiring translation. The
system is expected to notably improve the time needed to translate the National Library’s
web content into all the languages mentioned above, so that they can be available in one
or two days.

The National Library also has a channel on YouTube in which all the videos are
transcribed into the State’s different co-official languages.
• requests received in co-official languages
883

Regarding answers made in co-official languages on the Ask page: the libraries respond in

MINISTRY OF TERRITORIAL POLICY
• institutional printed material available to citizens in bilingual or co-official
language versions

Regarding publications, the Ministry has published in all the co-official languages four

posters in the State’s different co-official languages. These posters can be accessed on
the Ministry’s website:
(http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html)
• degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages
The co-official languages are available on the Ministry’s website (http://www.mpt.es); much
of its content has been translated into same. In the last few years a great deal of effort has
been made to translate and revise content.

Given the large volume of information posted on the website of the Ministry of Territorial
Policy, a decision was made to adapt same by navigation levels, beginning with the higher
ones, which are more visible.

Webpage content is currently translated until at least the fourth navigation level, and even
more in some sections. For the time being, news reports are not translated, due to the
urgency of same, as they lose effect if they have to wait to be translated. Translating them
later is not considered, as their interest decreases with time.
884

An estimated 300 pages have been definitively translated to date.

This means (http://www.mpt.es) has also been used to place at the disposal of local
administrations benefiting from the State Fund for Local Investment the project
announcements

in

co-official

languages,

as

can

be

consulted

at

the

URL

http://www.mpt.es/prensa/actualidad/noticias/2009/01/20090116.html. These posters were
reused for the State Fund for Local Sustainability and Employment.

When organising the Ministry’s website the need to have content translated into the coofficial languages is being taken into account.

In the work environment of the Ministry’s employees the linguistic diversity of the Spanish
State is also considered. The Ministry’s Intranet (http://intranet.mpt.es) was thus conceived
in line with this criterion; page versions are provided in the co-official languages and it is
prepared to house content translated into same.
• requests received in co-official languages
The percentage of written material received in co-official languages besides Castilian by
the Directorate General of Autonomous Community Development is estimated to be less
than 1% with respect to Transfers. All answers are given in Castilian.

Written complaints concerning co-official languages received by the Official Languages
Office in the AGE, from the Directorate General of Autonomous Community Cooperation,
are presented in co-official language or bilingual version.

Regarding the Directorate General of Local Cooperation, numerous requests have been
received in the various co-official languages of the State regarding the State Fund for
Local Investment, regulated by Royal Decree-Law 9/2008 of 28 November, and the State
Fund for Local Employment and Sustainability, regulated by Royal Decree-Law 13/2009 of
26 October; their processing in no way differs from the rest.

There are investiture application requests in the registry of state-qualified civil servants
which are received in co-official languages but have not been counted.
885

The following requests to register courses have been counted in the registry of statequalified civil servants: 150 in Catalan (4.28%); 150 in Galician (4.28%); 200 in Valencian
(5.71%) and 60 in Basque (1.72%). Responses are given in Castilian.

requirement for certain positions, but does not involve the award of additional points.

886

Regarding auxiliary staff assigned to the Ministry of Education, in positions in Autonomous
Communities with official language the accredited knowledge of the respective language
may be required to carry out duties directly related to information provided to the public,
document reception and registration, and activities with a significant degree of closeness
to the public.

MINISTRY OF HOUSING
• Degree of accessibility to web pages in co-official languages
The Ministry’s website includes functions enabling translation of menus and titles, as well
as the content of some pages into the co-official languages.

For example, http://rbe.vivienda.es:8080 is entirely translated into the co-official languages
of the different Autonomous Communities.

In other cases, only the menus and titles are translated, and exceptionally some pages, for

versions

Regarding the dissemination and reception of printed material, forms and requests in the
different co-official languages, the Ministry of Public Works [Ministerio de Fomento] makes
constant translation efforts by means of the peripheral offices to aid use by interested
parties addressing themselves to branches based in the territory of an Autonomous
Community with its own co-official language. This is always done in accordance with the
provisions of article 36 of Law 30/1992 of 26 November, with a view to translating into
Castilian all writings and documents requiring involvement by the central bodies.

Statistical questionnaires in this Ministry are fundamentally drawn up in Castilian, except
those provided in other co-official languages to interested parties who expressly request
same. In such cases the questionnaire and instructions are sent in the desired language.
Some surveys, however, such as those concerning building construction, are already
posted on the Ministry’s website in all the co-official languages. Plans call for that measure
to be extended to the other statistics and reports of such type.

888

Regarding passenger complaints, in the airports of the Spanish Airports and Air Navigation
network the public body places official complaint forms in the different co-official languages
for their use at the information counters.

communication in the respective co-official language to all persons who so desire. To
that end, the Tax Agency’s portal is available in Castilian as well as in Catalan, Galician
and Valencian. Specific information is also offered in Basque.

Given the volume of information to translate, the inclusion of these pages has been
gradual. For this reason, users are offered contents in Catalan, Galician and Valencian;
those not yet available in said language are provided in Castilian. The Tax Agency is
nevertheless committed to continue improving in this area. In any case, it is guaranteed
that taxpayers can use the language that is co-official in their respective Autonomous
Community.

The translated content encompasses all navigation levels, except News, due to its
immediate nature, and other exceptions for technical reasons or the times needed for
translation, especially in the case of PDF documents. As for the translation of
normative provisions, only those translated into the corresponding co-official language
in official gazettes will be included.

The Tax Agency’s Internet portal offers two kinds of services: Tax Information and
Personalised Services. Tax information services are offered in Castilian, Catalan,
Valencian and Galician. Only specific information is provided in Basque. The
personalised services are offered in the language preferred by the user (Castilian,
Catalan, Galician and Valencian) whenever possible, and in Castilian when it is not.

Euro-Latin-American Youth Centre (CEULAJ) are offered in the co-official languages, at
general information levels as well as in the navigation system and the resources for handling
requests for information about these programmes.

Regarding the website of the Institute for Women, efforts are currently under way to update
the versions in the co-official languages, which will soon be available for consultation.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL POLICY
• publicity campaigns in bilingual or co-official language versions
Some 96.96% of this Ministry’s institutional publicity campaigns from 2006 to 2009 (32 of

• requests received and answered in co-official languages

The Government Attorneys Office in the Territorial Management of Navarre has received
no request in Basque.

Directorate General of Registries and Notaries

Statistical data referring to the use and offer of Basque in written documents in the Civil
Registries of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre are indicated in the below table referring to
the number of INFOREG registrations by language or official language in the 2009 period:

Paragraph 2: In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory the number
of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is such as to justify the
measures specified below, the Parties undertake to allow and/or encourage:

sub-paragraph a: the use of regional or minority languages within the framework of the
regional or local authority;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was fulfilled with respect to local authorities located in the “Basque-speaking zone”.

904

The Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking was not fulfilled with
respect to the regional authorities. It therefore urged the respective authorities to take the
steps needed to ensure that the Basque language is used in the administration of the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre which provides services to residents of the “Basquespeaking zone”.

In its report the Committee of Experts referred to article 15.1 of ‘Foral’ Decree
29/2003. Said article had been cancelled due to various rulings from the High Court of
Justice of Navarre, but those rulings were being appealed before the Supreme Court. On
18 May 2009 the latter denied the appeal filed by the Government of Navarre, thereby
confirming the rulings of the High Court of Justice of Navarre and definitively cancelling
said article.

The article established that communications from public administrations located in
the mixed zone addressed to citizens in the Basque-speaking zone should be done in
Castilian. The courts confirmed that the criterion establishing which languages should be
used is the citizen’s place of residence and not the location of the public administration
office effecting the communication in question. For this reason, and as established in the
‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language, communications to citizens in the Basque-speaking
zone are to be done in the two official languages: Basque and Castilian.

As the Supreme Court ruling was published very recently, compliance with same
may be verified by the spot visit, and likewise the fulfilment of this commitment.

sub-paragraph b: the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to submit oral
or written applications in these languages;

The Committee of Experts found that this undertaking was fulfilled with respect to the local
authorities situated in the “Basque-speaking zone”.

The Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking was only formally fulfilled in
practice as regards the Navarre administration and urged the competent authorities to take
the necessary steps to enable the applications in Basque to the Navarre administration to
be treated in due time.

905

When the Recommendation from the Committee of Experts of the Committee of Ministers
of the Council of Europe on the Charter’s application in Spain was approved in December
2008, the Basque language was considered a merit for positions situated in the Basquespeaking zone but not for the far majority of jobs located in the mixed zone. In the first
quarter of 2009 the Government of Navarre approved consideration of the draft ‘Foral’
Decree establishing in the structure of the administration of the ‘Foral’ Community of
Navarre and its autonomous bodies the treatment of Basque language knowledge, with a
view to including it in the merit scales used to select and assign job positions, as well as its
submission to the Council of Navarre to produce the mandatory report prior to its definitive
approval by the Government.

Staff figures referring to 31 December 2007 indicate that of the 17,956 existing basic
posts, 13,086 are in the mixed zone (72.88%), 3,833 in the non-Basque-speaking zone
(21.35%) and 1,037 in the Basque-speaking zone (5.78%). Regarding the percentage of
positions with higher ratings, the figures show the following: in Core Administration
(including ‘Foral’ Police and Firefighters), the value was higher in 65.23% of positions, in
Education (non-teaching personnel) it was 56.96% and in the Navarre Health ServiceOsasunbidea (non-health personnel) it was 58.37%. The sum of the three fields shows us
that the higher value for Basque occurs in 62.69% of the positions.

The approval of this ‘Foral’ Decree along with other steps will help increase the percentage
of personnel in Navarre’s administration who can serve Basque speakers presenting oral
or written applications in Basque.

In 2009 the personnel structure of the Office of Information and General Registry of the
Government of Navarre (mixed zone) was modified, with the inclusion of a person with a
bilingual profile to personally serve and handle calls in Basque from interested parties who
so desire.

Taxpayers from the Basque-speaking and mixed zones can on the other hand present
their declarations in Castilian or Basque, as the forms and assistance programmes are
available in both languages.

Also, since April 2009 a web application has been implemented on the website of the
Navarre Tax Agency enabling taxpayers from the Basque-speaking zone and mixed zone
906

to select the language (Castilian or Basque) in which they want their proposed income tax
return to be sent, on the assumption that they meet the conditions to receive same.

Finally, in 2009 income tax return proposals were sent in Basque to those taxpayers
pertaining to the Basque-speaking and mixed zones who the previous year had submitted
their declaration in Basque and who met the conditions to receive that tax return proposal;
a total of 252 proposals were sent.

sub-paragraph c: the publication by regional authorities of their official documents also in
the relevant regional or minority languages;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
had been fulfilled. The experts noted in their report that the Navarre Official Gazette [BON]
was published at the same time in Castilian and Basque.

The Navarre Official Gazette has been published in Basque for 20 years, whereby
Navarrese legislation for at least the last 20 years is available in Basque. Since 2001 the
BON’s text has been posted in both Basque and Castilian on the Internet.

To wit, the undertaking continues to be fulfilled.

sub-paragraph d: the publication by local authorities of their official documents also in the
relevant regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph e: use by regional authorities of regional or minority languages in debates
in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the
State;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was fulfilled.

In the Parliament of Navarre the use of Basque, besides Castilian, is totally possible
in plenary sessions and the various committees. To that end, the Parliament has a number
of translators on its staff and a system of simultaneous translation.
907

In Internet transmissions of plenary sessions and committee meetings, citizens can
follow same live and listen to the speeches in Basque or their translation into Castilian.

sub-paragraph f: the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in
their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;

sub-paragraph g: the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the
official language(s), of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority
languages.

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was fulfilled. The Committee of Experts referred to various projects to make Basque place
names official in the mixed zone and praised the authorities for those projects. It asked the
authorities to comment on complaints indicating that bilingual place names were withdrawn
in municipalities situated in the mixed and non-Basque-speaking zone, regarding the
labelling of Zizur Mayor.

In this regard it must first be noted that the Government of Navarre did not approve any
modification of the bilingual place names. On the contrary, Euskerabidea conducted a
campaign in 2008 addressed to all Navarrrese municipalities whose Basque name was still
not official, asking them to request that the Government officialise the bilingual names, and
they therefore had a bilingual denomination. The campaign was addressed to all town
halls and approximately 15 decided to also officialise their names in Basque. All those who
so requested saw the Government of Navarre approve their names in Basque and
Castilian. Some of those municipalities are situated in the non-Basque-speaking zone,
such as Cirauqui/Zirauki, Olite/Erriberri, Peralta/Azkoien, Ancín/Anzin, among others.

Plans call for a similar campaign addressed to the concejos [councils districts].
Euskerabidea has thus asked Euskaltzaindia [Royal Academy of the Basque Language] to
approve the Basque names of all the concejos in Navarre. The campaign will get under
way as soon as the latter approves the rule on concejo names.
908

Regarding ruling no. 000187/2007 handed down by the High Court of Justice of Navarre
on 10 April 2007, concerning the labelling of Zizur Mayor/Zizur Nagusia, it was
implemented on 18 February 2008, with signs indicating said locality placed in Castilian
and Basque.

Lastly, as regards motorway names, the Government Agreement dated 25 September
2006 establishes the pertinent instructions for labelling and placing signs in the Navarre
Motorway Network.

The above-mentioned Government agreement indicates the following in its sub-paragraph
1 b):

“The place names and names of territories, population centres and interurban roads
whose official name is bilingual in Castilian and Basque shall be used as follows:
•

In Castilian and Basque on road sections in the Basque-speaking zone;

•

In Castilian and Basque in road sections in the mixed zone;

•

In Castilian in the road sections in the non-Basque zone.”

PARAGRAPH 3: With regard to public services provided by the administrative authorities or
other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
regional or minority languages are used, in accordance with the situation of each language
and as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a: to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used in the
provision of the service; or

The explanatory report on the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages
indicates that this paragraph 3 refers to “action by bodies providing public services,
whether under public or private law, where they remain under public control: postal
services, hospitals, electricity, transport, and so on.”
909

The website of the post office (Correos) is accessible in the other official languages
of Spain besides Castilian. Printed material to be filled out at stations in the Basquespeaking zone and the mixed zone are bilingual.

Regarding the transport sector, the Government of Navarre has created a Youth
Card to be used in public transport. The application form and the card itself are available in
both Basque and Castilian.

Paragraph 4: With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3
accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the following measures:

sub-paragraph a: translation or interpretation as may be required;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was partly fulfilled and urged the authorities to provide more specific information in line
with the questions asked by the Committee of Experts in its first monitoring cycle.

The Translation Section of the Department of the Presidency, Justice and Interior of
the Government of Navarre comprises a section chief, 14 translators and 4
translators/interpreters. The Translation Section of the Department of Education comprises
4 translators and a section chief. Moreover, the Department of Justice, as indicated in
article 9, is party to a translation and interpretation contract for the amount of €110,000 in
2006, €142,000 in 2007 and €157,000 in 2008. The Department of the Presidency, Justice
and Interior has also set aside an outlay of €180,000 to subcontract the translation of texts
to and from Basque.

The translation section of the Department of Education does all translations ordered
by that department; the company contracts all those corresponding to the Department of
Justice; and the Translation Section of the Department of the Presidency, Justice and
Interior handles all other translations from the various departments of the Navarrese
Government.

910

All requested translations are done directly by the different sections or
subcontracted. The deadline for the translations varies depending on the different needs.
Some translations are done on the same day, while for others more time is allowed.

In “The Situation of Basque in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre. Socio-linguistic Study.
Year 2008” the population was asked its opinion about the use of Basque by part of the
public administration in certain areas.

According to figures from that study, 42.8% of Navarre’s population believes the presence
of Basque in the administration is sufficient, 28.9% believe it is insufficient and 28.3% had
no opinion on the matter.

Regarding assessment of the steps taken to boost the use of Basque, in general all the
queried measures received were rated very positively; the responses obtained in the
Basque-speaking zone were more favourable compared to those recorded in the nonBasque-speaking zone.

Specifically, the best rated policy was that associated to the gradual inclusion of Basque in
teaching, approved by 56.8% of the survey population, a proportion which rose to 70.6%
among residents of the Basque-speaking zone. In the non-Basque-speaking zone,
although the percentage was lower (48.2%) it was also the most popular measure.

Likewise rated very positively was the use of Basque in place names (55.1% rated this
measure as very good – 60.2% in the mixed zone), the granting of subsidies to promote
Basque (53.4% rated this measure good or very good), and road signs in Basque (52.3%).

Relations with the public administration and compulsory teaching of Basque in public
schools were also positively rated: 51.2% and 44.8% of the population favoured those
measures. However, in the mixed and non-Basque-speaking zones the compulsory
teaching of Basque in public schools was the most criticised policy (34% and 43.1%
respectively rated this measure as bad or very bad).

Lastly, regarding the rating of Basque knowledge in public job offers, 41.7% of the
population positively valued the adoption of such measures.

911

With respect to this question, the Government of Navarre approved, as indicated above,
‘Foral’ Decree 55/2009 of 15 June, indicating in the personnel structure of the
administration of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and its autonomous bodies the
treatment of Basque language knowledge.

After that ‘Foral’ Decree took effect, Basque language knowledge was rated, for all
positions in the Basque-speaking zone, at a minimum of 6 percent vis-à-vis total points
assigned for all merits, so long as knowledge of that language is not required for the post.
In the mixed zone, which concentrates nearly 80% of the administration’s jobs, the
minimum rating will be 3 percent.

sub-paragraph b: recruitment and, where necessary, training of the officials and other
public service employees required;

According to figures from the Basque and Community Languages Service, the following
public service personnel finished the training course in Basque:

Besides the training the Government of Navarre provides to those civil servants who
request it, Paragraph 2.b details the data associated to the draft of the new ‘foral’ decree
which will indicate in the personnel structure the value set for Basque language knowledge
and the respective percentages for that knowledge. With the upcoming approval of this
new decree the Government of Navarre will guarantee both the contracting and training of
a sufficient number of civil servants.
912

sub-paragraph c: compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to be appointed in the
territory in which that language is used.

Paragraph 5: The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names in the
regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was fulfilled, as the registration of Basque names and surnames is a habitual and
accepted practice.

State Law 40/1999 of 5 November concerning names and surnames and their order
includes certain limitations regarding name substitution and regularisation of the correct
standard forms for surnames. For its part, Royal Decree 193/2000 of 11 February, on the
modification of certain Civil Registry Regulations articles concerning names and surnames
and their order, specifically establishes that “the substitution of the proper name by its
onomastic equivalent in any of Spain’s languages requires, if it is not obvious, that the
equivalence and correct spelling of the requested name be accredited by the respective
means”. It also establishes the same for surnames. This Civil Registry regulation therefore
makes it possible for surnames to comply with the standardised form, even without the
certificate, when the standardised form is well known. In practice, this is understood to
occur when other persons with the same surname have been accredited in the same
Registry.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 11. MEDIA.

Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority languages
within the territories in which those languages are spoken, according to the situation of each
language, to the extent that the public authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have
power or play a role in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:
913

sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service
mission: to ensure the creation of at least one radio station and one television channel in the
regional or minority languages;

In its December 2008 report the Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking
was not fulfilled. Four of the Experts’ five observations are directly associated to the
reception of EITB radio and television programmes in Navarre and existing relations
between the Basque Government and the Government of Navarre to enable EITB to be
received in Navarre.

Note that EITB is the public radio and television of a bordering Autonomous
Community over which the Navarrese authorities hold no power of any kind. It must also
be mentioned that, as with any operator, the respective authorisation is required to use
radio space and EITB lacks the title allowing it to broadcast in the ‘Foral’ Community of
Navarre.

The Government of Navarre agrees with the Experts’ report to the effect that
cooperation between the Autonomous Communities is the best way to fulfil this
undertaking. To that end, on 13 March 2008 the Parliament of Navarre approved a
resolution urging the Government of Navarre to seek ways to sign agreements with
neighbouring Autonomous Communities so that Navarrese regional DTT channels can be
received in same and vice versa, always in accordance with the institutional reality of
Navarre. The Government of Navarre was also urged, once the agreements are signed, to
ask the Ministry of Industry to grant the corresponding DTT multiplex to the ‘Foral’
Community.

The governments of Navarre and the Basque Autonomous Community established
the first technical contacts and talks were resumed with a clear willingness to sign a firm
agreement guaranteeing normal reception in Navarre of EITB television broadcasts.

There are currently two EITB television channels received throughout Navarre via
analogue television, but we cannot guarantee that when the “spot visit” takes place the
channels will be able to be seen in digital terrestrial television.

914

It is worth recalling that the “Socio-linguistic Study on Evolution of the Basque
Language in Navarre (1986-2003), commissioned by the Education Department of the
Government of Navarre, draws various conclusions regarding the consumption of
audiovisual media and its relationship with Basque language use. With respect to
television, in the Basque-speaking zone the Basque Community’s channels have more
viewers than the other television channels, with percentages above 50% in the responses.
By language profile, the Basque-speaking population mostly watched EITB-1, the bilingual
population was split between EITB-1 and EITB-2, and the Castilian speakers with Basque
watched EITB-2 and Telecinco in that order. About 25% of the Navarrese population
definitely watched Basque content on television.

As for the role of Spanish Television in the ‘Foral’ Community, it has cut to regional
broadcasts since 5 July 2008 consisting of a half-hour daily news bulletin preceded by
“ARIN ARIN”, which presents the day’s main stories in Basque. This regional broadcast is
for the entire territory of the ‘Foral’ Community, including the mixed and non-Basquespeaking zone.

The agreement signed by the Government of Navarre and the Basque Government on 17
April 1996 on the reception in Navarre of Euskal Irrati-Telebista (EITB) services was not
further developed.

The two signatory Governments did not eventually create the “Paritary Committee to
Monitor Implementation of the Agreement and the actions undertaken in its development”
envisaged in its clause 6. Nor did they sign the accord that should have encompassed “the
technical and economic aspects that make application of this agreement viable”, as set in
clause 7.

With the new Basque Government that emerged after the March 2009 elections, the
Government of Navarre signed in July 2009 a General Collaboration Protocol which,
besides EITB, affected matters concerning education, the Basque language and
infrastructures.

In that text, the Government of the Basque Autonomous Community and the ‘Foral’
Community of Navarre pledged to take the necessary steps to ensure that EITB-1 and

915

EITB-2 programmes can be broadcast in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre, in compliance
with obligations as regards broadcast rights.

To broadcast Euskal Telebista services in Navarre, the Government of Navarre authorises
that the ETB-1 and ETB-2 channels can be broadcast in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre
by means of a new DTT multiplex.

The Government of Navarre also pledges to provide multiplex broadcast service
throughout the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre in market conditions, with the Basque public
television responsible for paying the costs of conveying and maintaining the two television
signals (ETB-1 and ETB-2).

To make the broadcasts possible, the Government of the Autonomous Community of the
Basque Country and the Government of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre also pledge to
take the necessary steps with the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade vis-à-vis
planning and assignment of the necessary multiplex.

In the second clause of the accord, the Government of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre
pledges to ensure that the above-mentioned ETB channels are broadcast in the ‘Foral’
Community’s territory, in all cases respecting its images, schedules, trademarks and
identifying signs. For its part, ETB will be responsible for the content of its programmes, to
the effect that no other institution or operator can intervene in the signal.

In the third point, ETB pledges that in all its broadcasts it will respect the political, social
and institutional reality, symbols and identity of Navarre, in compliance with current
legislation and Constitutional Court Judgment 94/1985 of 29 July.

Also, “the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre will be presented and represented as a reality
different from the Basque Autonomous Community and its historical territories in
information written by ETB professionals, in presentations by same and in graphic aspects.
In all self-produced ETB programmes an effort shall also be made to include and respect
the distinct political and ideological tendencies of the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre”.

916

On the other hand, it establishes that “the Audiovisual Council of Navarre may pronounce
on ETB broadcasts exclusively produced for the ‘Foral’ Community, in accordance with the
currently valid standards for audiovisual material in the ‘Foral’ Community”.

At present, both the Basque Government and the Government of Navarre are working out
technical and economic aspects of the above-mentioned accord, and expect the
Government of Spain to grant the mandatory multiplex that will enable the two Euskal
Telebista channels to be broadcast in the ‘Foral’ Community via the digital terrestrial
television system. The Ministry of Industry is confident that it can be included in its overall
planning of DTT in Spain – the definitive implementation will be finalised in April 2010.

sub-paragraph b, i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station
in the regional or minority languages;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this undertaking
was not fulfilled and urged the authorities to find ways to support private radio stations.

There is a private station Xorroxin Irratia (88.0 MHz) in Lesaka. Its broadcasts are
heard in the localities of Zugarramurdi, Urdaz, Baztán, Malerreka and Cinco Villas, and are
entirely in Basque, both advertising and programme content, as is almost all the music in
its programming.

In all, six municipal radios broadcast in Navarre, on a concession basis or with
reserved frequency. Of these, one broadcasts only music (Pamplona/Iruña), while the
other five offer their own local programming during the morning time slots. Four of these
offer their content in Basque (Basaburua, Lekunberri, Etxarri-Aranatz and Leitza) and one
in Castilian (Fontellas).

Regarding the specific nature of each station’s programming, Basaburua’s
municipal radio operates with the name “Esan Erran”. It broadcasts from 10 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. its own programmes of a markedly local nature, albeit during this period it also
occasionally switches to the municipal stations of Lekunberri and Etxarri-Aranatz. The
remaining broadcast time is devoted to repeating the signal from Euskalerria Irratia in
Pamplona, which for its part generally links to Euskadi Irratia of EITB; 100% of its
programming is in Basque.
917

“Aralar Irratia” is the name of Lekunberri’s municipal station. It broadcasts its own
production entirely in Basque for five hours a day: from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. During this period
it occasionally switches over to the municipal stations of Basaburua, Etxarri-Aranatz and
Leitza for news from those valleys. During the remaining broadcast time it is directly linked
to the Euskalerria Irratia station in Pamplona, which in turn hooks up to the Euskadi Irratia
broadcasts of EITB; 100% of its programming is in Basque.

The Etxarri-Aranatz station is operating under the name “Beleixe Irradia” and is
managed by the Bierrik Cultural Association. It broadcasts its own local programming for
five hours in the morning and also occasionally switches over to the stations in Basaburua
and Lekunberri. During the remaining broadcast time it is directly linked to the Euskalerria
Irratia station in Pamplona, which in turn hooks up to the Euskadi Irratia broadcasts of
EITB; 100% of its programming is in Basque.

In Leitza the town hall directly manages the municipal radio station. It is called
“Karrape Irradia” and offers its own local programming from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The rest of
the time it connects to Euskadi Irratia of EITB; 100% of its broadcasts are in Basque.

The five radio stations receive economic assistance from the town halls and also
from the Government of Navarre. They applied for aid meant to encourage the use of
Basque in print, radio and television news outlets in financial year 2008 and previous
years, and all of them have received economic aid directly from the Government of
Navarre. Specifically, in 2008 they were awarded the following subsidy amounts:
•

Aralar Irratia

9,449€

•

Beleixe irratia

9,685€

•

Karrape Irratia

8,280€

•

Esan-Erran Irratia

9,659€

•

Xorroxin Irratia

16,205€

In 2008 meetings were held with representatives from the General Council of Aezko
(administrative body situated in the Basque-speaking zone which groups various town
halls) to set up a radio to broadcast informative content in Basque. With a view to
encouraging the creation of a new Basque language radio station, “Irrati Irradia”, the call
918

for applications to receive assistance for the use of Basque contained a specific section for
new radio media projects to be located in the Basque-speaking zone which have a
broadcast concession. That body applied for the assistance in 2008 and was granted
14,000 euros to implement the infrastructure. Plans call for it to begin broadcasting during
2009.

On the other hand, the Parliament of Navarre approved in a session held on 6
February 2009 a resolution whereby the Government of Navarre was urged to sign
financing agreements with Navarre’s Basque language media outlets to assure their
function and survival. The Parliament expects that said agreements will in the middle term
guarantee that Basque language media outlets receive stable economic assistance.

With a view to complying with the resolution of the Parliament of Navarre and to
back the Basque language radio, television and print media, several meetings were held
by Euskerabidea and Topagunea, the body grouping the Basque language media. An
agreement is being negotiated and written which in three or four years will ensure
economic stability for the different Basque language media outlets. During the next “spot
visit” complete information can be provided about this signed agreement.

sub-paragraph c, i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

The Committee of Experts considered in its December 2008 report that this
undertaking was not fulfilled.

What was stated for sub-paragraph 11.a.1 must be reiterated, namely that the
Basque-language EITB television channels currently and normally received throughout
Navarre’s territory by analogue television will soon be able to be received by DTT due the
efforts undertaken by the Government of Navarre.

Doubtless the biggest problem hampering the existence of local television
broadcasting entirely in Basque in the Basque-speaking zone is the absence of a local
DTT demarcation in that zone. This matter is exclusively the State’s responsibility as per
article 149.1.21 of the Constitution, concerning planning of the public radio domain.
919

The Audiovisual Council of Navarre (CoAN) has been fully aware of this need. In
September 2004 it asked the Government of Navarre to take the necessary steps to
ensure that the northern zone of Navarre was not excluded from local digital television
service. The CoAN urged the Navarrese government to appeal to the Ministry of Industry
regarding the National Technical Plan for Local Digital Terrestrial Television, holding that
in its current form it excluded the northern zone of Navarre from local digital terrestrial
television service.

On the other hand, two local Basque-language television stations have been
receiving assistance from the Government of Navarre for the past several years: “Xaloa
Telebista” and “Ttipi-Ttapa Telebista”.

Xaloa is based in Elizondo. Its area of influence includes the localities of Baztán,
Urdazubi, Zugarramurdi, Bertizarana and Malerreka. For its part, Ttipi-Ttapa Telebista is
based in Bera and covers the localities of Lesaka, Doneztebe, Etxalar, Igantzi, Arantza,
Sunbilla, Zubieta, Elgorriaga, Ituren, Urrotz, Donamaria and Bertizarana.

Both television stations have for years applied for assistance to promote Basque
language use in Navarre’s press, radio and television outlets. Specifically, in the last year
of 2008 they applied to the Government of Navarre to take part in that process and were
both awarded aid – Xaloa Telebista received €12,724 and Ttipi-Ttapa Telebista €13,915.
Besides the aid awarded by the Government of Navarre they received aid from various
local bodies.

In its observation 470 the Committee of Experts notes that the support granted to
these two television stations, according to non-governmental sources, may end with the
switch from analogue to digital television and that these two channels will thereby not have
legal access to public funds. The Government of Navarre holds that those observations
from non-governmental sources are mere opinions with no value. There Government of
Navarre in no way intends to withdraw support from those stations.

The Government of Navarre has held meetings with those television stations,
especially with Xaloa Telebista, to see what it can do to ensure that the Basque-language

920

stations can be awarded a local digital licence. It is hoped that those have positive results
in the future.

sub-paragraph d: to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio
and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

The Government of Navarre fulfils this undertaking by awarding assistance. The first such
process concerns aid for the audiovisual production of Navarrese television stations in
2009, per the Regional Minister for Institutional Relations and Government Spokesperson
published in the BON (official gazette) on 1 May 2009. The process dispenses a total
amount of 3 million euros; its aim is to establish the system of aid for activities involving
the production and broadcast of audiovisual content by bodies holding concession licences
for digital terrestrial television granted at autonomous community and local levels.
Applications for aid can include works in Castilian and Basque. The process is ongoing;
the percentage of Castilian and Basque works to be included has yet to be determined.

The second call for applications for aid was held by the Managing Director of
Eusekerabidea to hold cultural activities in Basque in Navarre and was published in the
BON of 19 May 2008. This process was open solely to works in Basque. The 2008
process was completed and €6,000 euros were awarded to subsidise the only audiovisual
work applying for aid. It is a Basque language film about the Agote [Cagot] people in the
Basque-speaking part of Navarre. The aid application process for 2009 has yet to be
opened.

sub-paragraph e, i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at
least one newspaper in the regional or minority languages;

There is one single written daily newspaper in Basque, “Berria”, whose headquarters, tax
domicile and central offices are located in Guipúzcoa province in the Basque Country.
Since 2008 the call for applications for aid for Basque language media has allowed
newspapers from other communities to receive subsidies from the Government of Navarre,
depending on the number of copies distributed in Navarre. But even though the process
was specifically modified so that Berria could apply, it did not, and the Government of
Navarre was therefore unable to award it any subsidy.

921

The Collaboration Agreement currently being negotiated by Euskerabidea and
Topagunea includes among its aid recipients media that are distributed in Navarre, without
taking the registered office into consideration. Berria may therefore apply for aid in the
respective annual processes.

The Committee of Experts’ observation 479 states that the Government of Navarre
does not grant subsidies to “Nabarra Aldizkaria”, which is incorrect, and urges the
authorities to provide information in the next periodical report. The aid granted to “Nabarra
Aldizkaria” in the last four years is indicated below:

•

2005: 12,447.26 euros;

•

2006:10,041.31 euros;

•

2007: 13,136.28 euros;

•

2008: 9,051.28 euros.

sub-paragraph f, ii): to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual
productions in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using
regional or minority languages.

Resolution 40/2008 of the Managing Director of Euskerabidea, published in the Navarre
Official Gazette of 28 November 2008, approving the call for applications for aid
concerning the use of Basque in the print, radio and television media of Navarre, includes
training in journalism among modalities that can be subsidised. The respective budget
outlay is €9,600. Students enrolled in the last academic year of Journalism or Audivosiaul
Communication, or with degrees in Journalism or Audiovisual Communication, can apply
for this aid.

“Xorroxin Irradia” submitted a request for aid in that process, which was accepted.

922

Paragraph 2: The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language used in identical or similar
form to a regional or minority language, and not to oppose the retransmission of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in such a language. They further
undertake to ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and free
circulation of information in the written press in a language used in identical or similar form to
a regional or minority language. The exercise of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it
carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions,
restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society,
in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of
disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or
rights of others, for preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of the users of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into account within such bodies as may be
established in accordance with the law with responsibility for guaranteeing the freedom and
pluralism of the media.

The interests of Basque-speaking citizens and those who use other languages are
defended in Navarre by the democratically elected representatives chosen in successive
elections.

In this regard, the Parliament of Navarre is the institution ultimately responsible for
ensuring strict compliance with the ‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language, particularly as
regards compliance with the rules guaranteeing respect for the freedom, plurality and
presence of the minority languages in the media.

The Navarrese legislature also chooses members of the two bodies which specifically
supervise the activities of the Navarrese audiovisual media: the Audiovisual Council of
Navarre and the Advisory Council of Spanish Radio Television in Navarre.

3.4.2.6. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 12 .CULTURE
923

Paragraph 1. With regard to cultural activities and facilities – especially libraries, video
libraries, cultural centres, museums, archives, academies, theatres and cinemas, as well as
literary work and film production, vernacular forms of cultural expression, festivals and the
culture industries, including inter alia the use of new technologies – the Parties undertake,
within the territory in which such languages are used and to the extent that the public
authorities are competent, have power or play a role in this field:

Sub-paragraph a): to encourage types of expression and initiative specific to regional or
minority languages and foster the different means of access to works produced in these
languages;

The Committee of Experts considered that article 12, paragraph 1, sub-paragraph a) was
fulfilled in its first monitoring cycle. As there were no major problems regarding that subparagraph and as no new information was received, the Committee of Experts did not
evaluate its application nor make observations in the second monitoring cycle. The
activities described in the previous reports continue; below are set out some of the new
ones undertaken during the monitoring period:
•

At the Navarre Museum new didactic primary education material was produced in
Basque and Castilian which is used in Basque language guided visits to exhibitions
and can also be downloaded from the museum’s website;

•

At the Jorge Oteiza Museum various publications have been put out in Basque.
Noteworthy is the critical edition of Jorge Oteiza’s written work, several monographs
and guides for educators available in Basque. The website was reworked and is
now almost entirely in Basque as well. To ensure that more employees speak
Basque so that services can be offered in that language, several employees are
currently learning same;

•

The Truffle Museum in Metauten in the non-Basque-speaking zone received a
subsidy from the Government of Navarre so that all information panels,
programmes, documentation and brochures could also be in Basque;

•

The websites and documents of the Gustavo de Maeztu Museum in Estella-Lizarra,
the Isaba Ethnographic Museum, the Mill Eco-Museum in Zubieta, the Julio Caro
Baroja Ethnographic Museum in Estella-Lizarra, the Almadía [timber rafting]
Museum in Burgui, the Roncesvalles Museum and the Pamplona-Iruña Planetarium
924

are available in Basque and visits can be conducted in that language.

As for libraries, note that information is presented in Basque as well as Castilian
throughout the Government of Navarre’s network of more than 90 libraries. Printed
documents, library cards and the website are bilingual. The catalogue of the Navarre
Public Libraries includes a total of 12,973 titles published in Basque and available to all
interested readers throughout the Community.

Coinciding with Euskerabidea’s move to a new head office, a specific area was set
aside for use as a library. The Library Service of the Navarre Government plans to make it
a specialised library, so that its bibliographic collection will be available online to
Navarrese users via inter-library loans.

Regarding activities of the Ministry of Culture

Film and the Audiovisuals Promotion

Relevant current legislation

Law 55/2007 of 28 December, concerning cinema, indicates in its article 36:
“With a view to encouraging and protecting use of the co-official languages other than
Castilian in film and audiovisuals, and to promote the cultural plurality of Spain and equal
opportunities in the specific languages of each territory as regards audiovisual
expression and distribution, a fund for assistance or specific credits shall be established,
to be transferred in their entirety to the competent bodies of the Autonomous
Communities, which will manage same per their respective powers. This State
contribution is based on the principle of co-responsibility; it shall be annually indicated in
the General State Budget and is meant to encourage the production, distribution,
exhibition and promotion of the Film and Audiovisual Industry in the said languages”.

Additional clause 6 of the Cinema Law, concerning agreements to promote film and
audiovisuals in co-official languages other than Castilian, indicates that:
“The Ministry of Culture shall by means of an agreement specify the credits envisaged
in article 36 of the Law, so that the outlay each Autonomous Community receives in coofficial language is annually equivalent to the sum of contributions said Community
925

devoted in the previous financial year to supporting and encouraging the production,
distribution and promotion of audiovisuals in co-official language other than Castilian.
The outlay received by each Autonomous Community cannot be more than 50 percent
of the total assistance the audiovisual companies resident in said Community received
from the ICAA [Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts] in the previous year”.

Royal Decree 2062/2008 of 12 December elaborates on the Cinema Law and in its
article 19.3 elaborates on article 36 mentioned above.

Promotion of Books, Reading and Spanish Literature

In this scope, the rules governing the competitive assistance awards indicate that they
are open to all co-official languages of the State and are meant to foster private intercommunication among the Spanish cultures. In some of them the evaluation
committees include members of business associations or the academies for those
languages:

-

Assistance to companies and nonprofit institutions that publish culture magazines
written in any Spanish co-official language. The aim of this aid is to achieve the
free distribution of cultural magazines in the different Spanish official languages
in libraries and cultural centres in Spain and abroad. Subsidies can be awarded
each year to magazines published in Catalan, Galician and Basque;

-

Assistance to promote reading the dissemination of Spanish literature by holding
activities that promote the common Spanish culture both in Spain and abroad in
congress and seminars, etc, the participation and commemoration of
anniversaries and centennials (especially for writers), the fostering of reading
habits and promotion of public library use. The subsidies awarded each year are
open to activities undertaken in Catalan, Galician and Basque;

-

Assistance for the publication of literary works in any Spanish co-official
language. These subsidies are addressed to projects involving the publication in
926

the Spanish co-official languages of works from our culture, with national and
international projection, which contribute towards enriching our common
bibliographic heritage, with the double aim of augmenting the collections of
Spain’s public libraries and encouraging and fostering communication and
cultural cohesion among the Autonomous Communities, creating a common
bibliographic fund in all the public libraries.

National Literature Prizes

Regarding the National Prizes granted by the Ministry of Culture: representatives of the
co-official languages’ academies are included; the rules for all awards specify that
authors and works in any of Spain’s languages can be submitted. Many of these prizes
have been awarded to written work and authors in languages other than Castilian.

Promotion of the Stage Arts and Music

The National Institute of Stage Arts and Music (INAEM) followed during the 2006-2008
period a policy meant to boost the use of Spain’s regional languages in the assistance
granted for programmes to distribute, develop and preserve theatre and circus, and
regarding theatrical and circus-related communication.

Such is indicated by resolutions from the National Institute of Stage Arts and Music
dated 26 December 2005, 26 February 2007 and 8 February 2008, announcing
assistance for programmes to distribute, develop and preserve theatre and circus, and
theatrical and circus-related communication, for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008,
respectively.

To that end, the requirements for participation in the programme to disseminate theatre
nationally are flexible if the theatre productions are only performed in one of the official
languages other than Castilian. This flexibility consists of not requiring conditions that
are mandatory for other applications: first, that the projects tour at least three
Autonomous Communities; and second, that at least 40% of the performances take
place outside the Autonomous Community corresponding to the applicant’s registered
domicile.
927

sub-paragraph b): to foster the different means of access in other languages to works
produced in regional or minority languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing,
post-synchronisation and subtitling activities;

sub-paragraph c): to foster access in regional or minority languages to works produced in
other languages by aiding and developing translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and
subtitling activities

The Library Service of the Government of Navarre acquires for distribution throughout the
Library Network works translated to or from Basque with the double aim of facilitating
citizens’ access to those works and encouraging the translation of same.

With the goal of translating the most representative works of universal literature, all
works translated into Basque by the EIZIE Basque Association of Translators and
Interpreters are available in Navarre’s library network. All video and DVD audiovisual
products dubbed or subtitled in basque are likewise acquired so that they can be available
in all Navarrese libraries.

In 2008 Euskerabidea set aside assistance of €150,000 for the production of
Basque language cultural activities addressed to individuals or non-profit organisations.
The activities of translation, dubbing, post-synchronisation and subtitling into Basque could
be included among the beneficiary activities.

Regarding activity undertaken by the Ministry of Culture:

Translation of published works

The Ministry of Culture via the Sub-directorate General for the Promotion of Books,
Reading and Spanish Literature, annually awards the following translation assistance:

-

Aid for the translation and publication in any foreign language of literary or
scientific work by Spanish authors originally written and published in any of the
928

Spanish languages. The aim is to disseminate and promote Spanish culture
abroad. Any Spanish work written in any co-official language is eligible;

Sub-paragraph d): to ensure that the bodies responsible for organising or supporting
cultural activities of various kinds make appropriate allowance for incorporating the
knowledge and use of regional or minority languages and cultures in the undertakings which
they initiate or for which they provide backing

As indicated in the previous point, the award of aid for cultural activities in Basque set
aside a total amount of €120,000. Of this, €105,000 was awarded to 38 private nonprofit
bodies to hold cultural activities in different places in Navarre which gave Basque a
dominant role and would enable public access to activities in that language. The other
€15,000 was used to help town halls in the non-Basque-speaking zone that had no special
agreement signed with the Government to hold performances in Basque. The town halls
received aid accounting for 43.06% of the budget of their subsidised activities. For cultural
bodies, the percentage of aid granted by Euskerabidea was 27.78%.

Since 1998 the Government of Navarre has had a signed collaboration agreement
with all town halls in the Basque-speaking and mixed zones, and some of those in the nonBasque-speaking zone, to normalise use of the Basque language in the municipal
environment. The activites subject to cooperation are: promotion of Basque use and
Basque culture in municipal social life, contracting of Basque language technical personnel
for municipal services, planning and development of personnel policy as regards the
normalised used of Basque. and adjustment of administrative actions to current language
standards. The cooperation is economic, via shared financing by the Government and
local authorities of expenses deriving from the support and actions of the municipal
Basque language and technical/organisational services, through mutual provision of
relevant aid adopted by common agreement between Euskerabidea and the municipal
Basque language services. Pursuant to this agreement each local body must annually
present a programme which among other aspects includes the cultural activities for which
it is requesting aid, with explicit mention of goals and content, as well as any other activity
promoting Basque undertaken in the municipal environment.

929

Regarding cultural actions, over the course of the year the Culture Department
carries out three activity series throughout Navarre by means of programmes that include
theatre, music, plastic art, cinema and folklore activities, namely: Ronda de Primavera,
Correpueblos y Ronda de Otoño [Spring Round, Village Tour and Autumn Round]. These
programmes are offered to local bodies encompassing less than 1,000 inhabitants.
Besides choosing the kind of activity to be held, they also select the language they want
used (Castilian or Basque). It is quite normal in the Basque-speaking zone for the
language to be Basque; the percentage drops in the mixed zone.

Collaboration agreements continue to be signed with different Navarrese art-related
and cultural bodies that carry out activities in a Basque language context. The economic
contributions are meant to sustain same and help develop their annual cultural activities
programme. The bodies and cultural contributions in 2008 are indicated below:

Ortzadar E.F.T.

8,500 €

Nafarroako Berts. E.

20,000 €

Fundación Barandiaran

30,050 €

Eusko Ikaskuntza

60,100 €

A new addition were the school concerts in Basque addressed to Model D students.

The Government of Navarre has worked with Euskal Kantuzaleen Elkartea, the
association to promote Basque language song, to carry out the Gabonetan Basquez ere
bai! (during Christmas also in Basque!) campaign to promote Basque language use during
the Christmas period. Some 1,500 song books were distributed, which could also be freely
downloaded from the respective website. The campaign was well received and a total of
58 bodies from 49 different localities expressly joined it and sent photos of the event which
were later posted on the Euskerabidea website.

The Department of Education collaborated with the Navarre Atheneum and EIRE on
a conference cycle. The Navarre Atheneum is a non-profit association whose aim is to
promote and disseminate scientific and artistic knowledge; EIRE is the Association of
Basque-speaking University Professors. A cycle of 30 conferences in Basque and/or

930

Castilian was organised, which were held in March throughout Navarre and focused on
various distinct topics:
•

Navarre and Basque (Castilian) – Basque was the central axis for an agreeable
way to examine place names, history and oral traditions, etc, in Navarre;

•

Science, technology, crisis and communication (Basque) – Currently relevant
topics discussed in Basque.

Euskerabidea also organised its own Culture Cycle in Basque. This activity’s aim
was to bring Basque culture closer to local institutions and to support and boost artistic
creation in that language. From September to December 2008 a total of 47 actions were
carried out in 45 munipalities in Navarre’s three language zones. Some €80,000 was
invested, of which €30,000 was contributed by the Lagun Aro Foundation per a
collaboration agreement between the two bodies.

The Kultur Zikloa (Culture Cycle) will again be organised this year of 2009. It is
currently being prepared and will again count an €80,000 investment, of which Lagun Aro
will again contribute €30,000. As in previous years, the different kinds of activities will be
carried out throughout Navarre and be entirely in Basque: theatre, storytelling,
marionettes, bertsolaris [versifiers], concerts, exhibitions, clowns, magi, rural sports, street
theatre and open-air performances, etc.

All costs for these four actions (support for entities and cultural contributions,
Gabonetan Basquez ere bai!, Conference Cycle and 2008 Culture Cycle) are entirely
borne by the Government of Navarre; the town halls are responsible for the infrastructure
needed for the event: sites, stages, etc.

The Culture and Tourism Department of the Government of Navarre organises the
following cultural cycles with activities in Basque and Castilian.

The Navarre Institute for the Basque Language of the Government of Navarre also
organises a cultural cycle entirely in Basque called “Kultur Zikloa”. In 2009 it toured a total
of 45 Navarrese localities in just over a month and a half, with the aim of promoting
Basque via different kinds of cultural expression such as theatre, music, film and other
stage arts.

The Language Planning Service of the Government of Navarre also organises different
cultural activities entirely in Basque for schools.

Regarding activity by the Ministry of Culture:

1. Information disseminated on websites

The Ministry of Culture, National Library and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía
provide information in the co-official languages on their respective websites, thereby
fostering multi-lingualism in the dissemination of their cultural programming.

The National Library also has a YouTube channel in which all videos are transcribed into
the State’s different co-official languages.

2. Dissemination of information by means of other informative material

2.1 Temporary exhibitions

At the temporary exhibitions organised by the Ministry of Culture in the State Museums
exclusively managed by the Ministry which are located in Autonomous Communities with
co-official language, the information in the spaces (posters, informative texts, etc) and the
exhibition materil (leaflets, posters, press announcements, etc) are in the two co-official
languages of the Autonomous Community.

932

In other exhibitions on show in Autonomous Communities with co-official language in
which the Ministry collaborates with other institutions, both languages are generally used
in the exhibition material.

Prado National Museum

The Prado Museum has produced informative material in the State’s different co-official
languages. This consisted of translation of the map placed at visitors’ disposal at the
information desks located at the museum’s entrances. The copies produced in Basque are
detailed below:

Year 2008:
-

2,500 copies

Year 2007:
-

7,000 copies

Year 2006:
-

1,000 copies

Plans call for translation of the map to continue in coming years, as one of the goals for
the visitor attendance area set out in the Action Plan of the Prado National Museum (20092012).

Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía [MCARS]

The MNCARS considers that its generic information material (including brochures on the
permanent collection, maps and general museum information) must be adapted as soon
as possible to the State’s other co-official languages.

Spanish Cultural Heritage Institute [IPCE]

933

The main content of the IPCE’s website is currently translated. It also aims to implement
this multi-language dissemination by progressively translating some of the publications in
its publishing programme over the next few years.

Support fund for cinema in co-official languages: transfers calculated by applying the
935

principle of co-responsibility and legally coordinated by agreements with the Autonomous
Communities. In 2009 the transfers amounted to:

- Navarre: 100,000 €

Sub-paragraph e): to promote measures to ensure that the bodies responsible for
organising or supporting cultural activities have at their disposal staff who have a full
command of the regional or minority language concerned, as well as of the language(s) of
the rest of the population;

With a view to fostering the placement of staff with a full command of Basque in bodies
responsible for organising or supporting cultural activities, the Government of Navarre
offers all its employees who serve in those bodies the possibility of taking free Basque
language courses. These courses are also open to staff from local institutions that
organise cultural activities.

The Navarre Public Administration Institute offers extensive, intensive, part-time,
tutored self-learning, internship, review and improved oral expression, intensive EGA
[Basque language title] preparation and technical courses to all staff with responsibilities in
the area of culture. Besides these modalities, it subsidises attendance by interns and
awards grants to students who choose training options not provided by the administration.

The Collaboration Agreement signed by the Government of Navarre and local
bodies finances 100% of the cost of learning Basque for staff from local bodies and the
replacement of that staff during the training courses; the funds set aside by the
Government for this purpose are not annually exhausted.

In the personnel structure of the administration until present the job positions in
which Basque was a merit or mandatory were noted. In all positions in the Basquespeaking zone Basque was considered at least a merit, as established by the ‘Foral’ Law
on the Basque Language. In the first quarter of 2009, the Government of Navarre
approved consideration of the draft ‘Foral’ Decree indicating how the administration of the
‘Foral’ Community of Navarre and its autonomous bodies should treat Basque language
knowledge in its personnel structure, for the purpose of including it in the merit scale in job

936

selection and assignment processes, as well as its submission to the Council of Navarre to
produce the mandatory report prior to its definitive approval by the Government.

After that ‘Foral’ Decree was approved (Decree 55/2009), Basque language
knowledge was rated, for all positions in the Basque-speaking zone, at a minimum of 6
percent vis-à-vis total points assigned for all merits, so long as knowledge of that language
is not required for the post. In the mixed zone, which concentrates nearly 80% of the
administration’s jobs, the minimum rating will be 3 percent. Beyond these minimum 6 or 3
percent ratings, depending on the zone, a list of jobs involving more public attendance was
drawn up, including all positions providing public attendance, such as at museums and
libraries, in which those percentages rise to 10 or 5 percent respectively.

In the near future all positions of a cultural nature involving public attendance will
have Basque rated at 5% in the mixed zone and 10% in the Basque-speaking zone.

During the processing of that ‘Foral’ Decree in the Navarre Basque Language
Council, the Government of Navarre assumed the submitted amendment requesting that
after said ‘Foral’ Decree was approved the positions in the personnel structure should be
reviewed to ascertain whether mandatory knowledge of Basque should be extended to
other positions.

sub-paragraph f): to encourage direct participation by representatives of the users of a
given regional or minority language in providing facilities and planning cultural activities

The different public administrations in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre have taken
various steps to encourage and foster participation by representatives of Basque speakers
in the services and programmes of cultural activities.

At community level, the members of the Navarre Basque Language Council take
part in approval of the strategy and management plans of Euskerabidea, which establish
the different actions to promote cultural activities. There is also direct collaboration
between Euskerabidea and Topagunea, the body grouping Navarre’s various Basquelanguage cultural associations. As a result of this collaboration, Topagunea receives
937

subsidies from Euskerabidea and various activities are jointly organised; they also meet
periodically to work on mutual initiatives.

At municipal level, the representatives’ participation is much more active and direct
– for example, the Municipal Basque Language Service in Tafalla, a locality in the nonBasque-speaking zone, but which (like most municipal services in Navarre) has a Basque
Committee that sets lines of action. The committee’s aim is to assure communication and
collaboration between social and cultural groups and the town hall. It comprises a total of
54 groups: cultural associations, political groups, unions, schools, ikastolas [Basquemedium schools], euskaltegis [Basque language centres], sports groups, magazines,
commercial associations and parents associations. Its meetings are held on a monthly
basis.

Sub-paragraph g): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of a body or bodies
responsible for collecting, keeping a copy of and presenting or publishing works produced in
the regional or minority languages

The Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking was fulfilled as regards
literature and books, but urged the authorities to provide information in the next report on
audio, audiovisual and other kinds of works in the Basque language.

As the primary bibliographic centre in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre, the Navarre
General Library has the mission of gathering, studying, systemising and disseminating
Navarre’s bibliographic heritage, which includes publications in Basque. To that end, it
counts the entry of documents from the Legal Deposit; it also systematically purchases
publications that serve to enhance the Basque language bibliographic collection.

This important Basque language collection is shared among Navarre’s public
libraries, which along with the Navarre General Library comprise the public library network,
efficiently integrating and sharing the resources available in the whole. Information on
publications in Basque is offered in the collective catalogue of Navarre’s Public Libraries,
containing computerised information from the 93 public libraries, with 12,973 publications
938

in Basque. This catalogue can be consulted in all Navarrese public libraries and on the
Internet at www.navarra.es. The catalogue consultation application can be used in
Castilian, English, French and, of course, Basque.

Regarding audio, audiovisual and other kinds of works in Basque about which
information was requested, note that the Legal Deposit system is the same. Its aim is to
gather and preserve all bibliographic and audiovisual production of books, videos, DVDs,
CDs, CD-ROMs, cassettes, periodicals, brochures and posters, etc. It is organised as a
technical/administrative service that registers and keeps all such materials. This public
service benefits printers, publishers, authors, researchers and all citizens by safeguarding
these works for the future, assuring both access by citizens and the possibility of studying
same. The Legal Deposit system constantly increases the holdings of bibliographic
heritage and other information supports produced. At the same time, the inclusion of all
deposit titles in the Bibliography provides ample free publicity for printers and publishers.

The volume of audio, audiovisual and other kinds of works in Basque in the Library
Network, whose catalogue can be accessed by anyone over the Internet, is 451; there are
various copies of each work. By means of inter-library loans any person can request a
volume not available in his or her library; it will be sent at no expense from another
network library where it is available.

The Basque Language Media Library is a Euskerabidea project placing at the
disposal of any person interested in the Basque language all kinds of material produced in
the dialectal variants of Basque in Navarre: audio and audiovisual recordings of the
Basque speech used in Navarre and texts written in Navarre’s Basque dialects. The
project was begun 10 years ago and was then called the Navarre Basque Language
Fonoteca [phonograph records library]. It was backed jointly by the Government of
Navarre and Euskal Kultur Erakundea.

The primary aim of the Navarre Basque Language Media Library is to gather,
classify and place all that material at the disposal of academics and the general public in
an easily accessible computer system. It has been updated every year to include new
recordings and audio and audiovisual material. With this goal, in 2008 €50,000 was

939

invested in the Media Library, which along with all its holdings can be consulted at
www.mediateka.fonoteka.com.

Regarding action by the Ministry of Culture:

1. Deposit of published works

The National Library acts as a deposit for works published in any language in Spanish
territory.

2. Reference collections

The National Library has reference collections for different subject matter in all of the
State’s co-official languages.

Sub-paragraph h): if necessary, to create and/or promote and finance translation and
terminological research services, particularly with a view to maintaining and developing
appropriate administrative, commercial, economic, social, technical or legal terminology in
each regional or minority language.

The Committee of Experts considers this undertaking to be fulfilled and asks for no further
information in this regard.

Euskaltzaindia, the Royal Academy of the Basque Language, is the body
responsible for standardising the Basque language. The Government of Navarre signed a
co-financing agreement with same, whereby in 2006 the amount was €60,000. In 2009 this
budget outlay rose to €235,000.

The agreement signed by Euskaltzaindia and Euskerabidea for 2008 concerned the
following activities, many of them involving terminological research: atlas of local Basque
language varieties; symposia on legal/administrative terminology due to the overturning of
various Navarrese laws; terms with the markers Naf. (Navarrese dialect) and Naf. eta Lap.
(Navarrese and Labortan dialects) from the publication Hiztegi Batua (unified Basque
dictionary); rule no. 155 of Euskaltzaindia Nafarroako Udal Izendegia (nomenclature of
940

Navarrese municipalities); and delivery of a copy of work done on the Onomastic Corpus
during the January-December 2008 period to Euskerabidea.

For its part, the Department of Culture and Tourism/Prince of Viana Institute
publishes three annual volumes of one of world’s most prestigious publications on the
Basque language: “Fontes Linguae Vasconum. Studia et documenta”. It gathers studies
and contributions from outstanding researchers in this area, with a view to furthering the
respective scientific knowledge and dissemination, and was first published in 1969.

Collaboration with the UZEI University Studies Centre, a body devoted to studying
the Basque language’s terminology and lexicography, has continued in the last two years.
This relationship dates to 1987 and involves various departments: Public University of
Navarre; Department of the Presidency, Justice and Interior; and the Department of
Education. The most recent projects on which UZEI and Euskerabidea worked together
were on Navarrese plant names and, more recently, on the facilities for translation work,
specifically translation licences and reports.

Nafarterm is the terminology bank created by UZEI by contract with the Government
of Navarre. It is available on the Government of Navarre’s Intranet and can be accessed
by all employees. The terminology bank has 26 term classification sections. It is also
possible to make any consultation to UZEI via an email address.

Regarding translation services, the Government of Navarre has a Translation
Service comprising 19 translators who translate to and from Basque for public
administrations and citizens. There are also five translators at the Department of
Education.

Paragraph 2. In respect of territories other than those in which the regional or minority
languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the number of users of a regional
or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage and/or provide appropriate cultural
activities and facilities in accordance with the preceding paragraph.

941

In its report, the Committee of Experts concluded that this undertaking was fulfilled without
asking for complementary information.

What was stated above regarding compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of
article12 is repeated. Regarding museums, for example, it was shown that all information
is bilingual at the Truffle Museum, located in Metauten in the non-Basque-speaking zone.
It also counts Basque-speaking staff. Network libraries located in the non-Basquespeaking zone also have books in Basque. For example, in Tafalla there are more than
1,600 volumes in Basque and its catalogue can be consulted in that language. Loans or
consultations of works in Basque available in other Network libraries can be requested at
all libraries in the non-Basque-speaking zone. The six town halls which benefited from aid
awarded by Euskerabidea are located in the non-Basque-speaking zone. The cultural
bodies which received the €105,000 of aid are distributed throughout Navarre, including
the non-Basque-speaking zone. In the conference cycle organised by Euskerabidea in
collobration with the Navarrese Atheneum, both the Culture Cycle organised with Lagun
Aro Insurance and the Gabonetan Basquez ere bai! (during Christmas also in Basque!)
campaign were carried out across the whole of Navarre. In the conference cycle, 13 of the
30 events were held in the non-Basque-speaking zone; in the Gabonetan cycle 14
localities were in the non-Basque-speaking zone; and in the Culture Cycle, 25 of the 48
localities were also situated in the non-Basque-speaking zone.

The geographic criterion used to determine whether to hold or support cultural
activities in Basque is the whole of Navarre, albeit adjusting the activity’s language level to
the respective place. For this reason, in the non-Basque-speaking zone activities are often
programmed more for children, as they are the public who understand Basque.

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to make appropriate provision, in pursuing their
cultural policy abroad, for regional or minority languages and the cultures they reflect

In the two monitoring cycles, the Committee of Experts held that this undertaking
was fulfilled. In the last report it asked the authorities to comment on the complaints
received. The complaints by authorities from the Basque Country referred to the
Navarrese authorities’ failure to collaborate when organising events abroad. Nongovernmental sources stressed that Basque was not even mentioned at Expolangue 2006.

942

Regarding the above, since at least 2007 the only language promoted by the
Government of Navarre at the different language fairs in which it participated has been
Basque. Participation in those fairs was overseen by Euskerabidea, whose only language
of interest is Basque.

Euskerabidea would like to see attendance at language fairs in the future done in
stands shared at least with the Basque Country, though it can also be done with other
languages from Spain and also in collaboration with the Cervantes Institute.

In recent years the Government of Navarre has taken part in Expolingua Berlin and
in Expolangue Paris with a stand dedicated solely to the Basque language. The occasion
of that participation enabled visits to other bodies such as the main universities, Cervantes
Institute branches, the Pompidou Centre, etc. Our publications were distributed among
various entities and relations were established with people interested in our language and
with bodies that promote minority languages in their respective countries.

By means of collaboration with the Cervantes Institute of Berlin agreement was
reached to hold cultural activities at the Leipzig Book Fair. A notable result of this
collaboration was the conference given by the Basque-speaking Navarrese writer Eduardo
Gil Bera as part of the activities programme on “Minority Languages, Great Literatures”.
Eduardo Gil Bera was accompanied in Leipzig by the managing director of Euskerabidea.

As a consequence of joint efforts undertaken by the Cervantes Institute and
Euskerabidea, the two bodies signed a collaboration agreement in March 2009 with a view
to setting up a framework for institutional cooperation to promote Basque language and
culture outside of Spain via Cervantes Institute centres. This covers the organisation of
activities associated to publicising Basque language and culture at different Cervantes
Institute branches and the exchange of publications so that Cervantes Institute libraries
can access Euskerabidea publications. The Cervantes Institute’s users will also have
electronic access to the media library, where they can consult the extensive documental
and audiovisual holdings regarding the diverse Basque language variants. The agreement
is initially valid for two years, and can be renewed in the future. It also creates a committee
to monitor the agreement, comprising three members from each institute.

Regarding action by the Ministry of Culture:
943

1. Book fairs and sending of bibliographic material to cultural centres

At international book fairs where Spain is present with its own pavilion or also through
efforts by the embassies, the newly published works on show include books and
magazines in all the Spanish languages, partly proceeding from aid to magazine and book
publishers. The same can be said for the books sent to libraries and cultural centres.
On the other hand, regarding the presence of authors abroad at fairs and congresses, etc
– Spanish authors participate regardless of the co-official language in which they write.

Regarding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation

Use and offer of co-official languages in foreign cultural policy (Cervants, SEAEX,
etc).
The Cervantes Institute reports that it has signed various collaboration agreements with
cultural institutions to disseminate co-official languages in the framework of foreign cultural
policy. This includes academic and teaching activities with the following institutions:
Ramón Llull Institute, Royal Academy of the Basque Language-Euskaltzaindia, Navarre
Basque Language Institute, Royal Galician Academy of Language and the Language
Policy Secretariat of the Xunta of Galicia.

Since academic year 1994-1995 courses have been offered to learn Catalan, Galician and
Basque. The graphs below show the evolution of the courses offered in the past several
years.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 13. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE

Paragraph 1. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, within
the whole country:

Sub-paragraph a) to eliminate from their legislation any provision prohibiting or limiting
without justifiable reasons the use of regional or minority languages in documents relating to
economic or social life, particularly contracts of employment, and in technical documents
such as instructions for the use of products or installations;

The Committee of Experts made no comments in the report on the second monitoring
cycle as no problems associated to this sub-paragraph were noted in the first evaluation
945

report and no information was received that would require a re-evaluation of its application.
The undertaking is fulfilled.

Sub-paragraph b) to prohibit the insertion in internal regulations of companies and private
documents of any clauses excluding or restricting the use of regional or minority languages,
at least between users of the same language;

In Navarrese legislation there is no provision whatsoever that prohibits or limits use of the
Basque language. On the contrary, in its statement of purpose the ‘Foral’ Law on the
Basque Language indicates that “the instrumental nature of languages as a par excellence
vehicle for human communication makes it a fundamental support for social life, an
element of collective identity and factor in coexistence and understanding between
members of societies”. Article 2 establishes the law’s essential goals, which are to
“safeguard the right of citizens to know and use Basque and to determine the instruments
to make this effective and to protect the recovery and development of the Basque
language in Navarre, indicating measures to encourage its use”.

Following on the ‘Foral’ Law on the Basque Language, and among others, ‘Foral’
Decree 29/2003 was approved, regulating the use of Basque in public administrations. Its
basic aims include the statement that “in the Basque-speaking zone, to ensure that
employment is possible in either of the two official languages as language for work and
service to citizens”. Article 7 of that ‘Foral’ Decree forbids any discrimination when it
indicates “... always respecting both the right of citizens to freely choose either of the two
official languages in which they would like to be served, and the right to not suffer
discrimination for language reasons”, continuing that “... whichever language is used, all
administrative acts shall be valid and have full legal effect”.

The Government of Navarre has no knowledge to the effect that Navarrese companies
have originated situations of exclusion of limitation of Basque use that would require steps
to be taken in that regard.

It must nevertheless be noted that in any case it is up to the companies to determine the
conditions and content set out in their internal regulations, and not the Government of
Navarre.

946

Sub-paragraph c) to oppose practices designed to discourage the use of regional or
minority languages in connection with economic or social activities;

Here what was explained regarding sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 1 of this same article is
repeated.

The Navarrese administration was one of the first administrations to explicitly
include actions to promote the different languages, especially Basque, in programmes to
stimulate corporate responsibility.

Initiatives have been supported to strengthen and disseminate the concept of
business’s social responsibility. Policies with more social grounding have therefore been
encouraged, with the different social players participating. In this context and given the
motion approved by plenary session of the Parliament of Navarre on 22 November 2007,
by means of an Agreement dated 18 February 2008 an action plan was approved to draw
up the general programme to stimulate, promote and boost business’s social responsibility
in Navarre. To implement that agreement, the Department of Innovation, Enterprise and
Employment has led the process of drawing up that programme, working with the different
departments with responsibilities in the relevant subject matter. The programme was
submitted to consultation, for which more than 50 social organisations representing the
different sectors were invited. The General Programme to stimulate, promote and boost
Corporate Social Responsibility in Navarre was approved by the Government of Navarre
on 22 December 2008 and conceives business or corporate social responsibility to be a
mutual culture affecting companies and society and its institutions. Various distinct
objectives are thus set out to ensure integral action, covering measures to promote social
responsibility in companies and organisations, and also within the ‘Foral’ Community’s own
administration.

The General Programme to stimulate, promote and boost Corporate Social
Responsibility in Navarre involves, among others, the following actions:
•

Aid for implementing language plans addressed to companies;

•

Subsidies to local bodies to help contract Basque-speaking technical personnel and
to produce language plans.
947

The use of Basque in any social space in the ‘Foral’ Community of Navarre is delimited by
compliance with the current rules on the use and promotion of Basque. For this reason
practices discouraging its use in the business environment have not occurred.

Regarding the question of the degree of use of Basque in companies, note that it is
associated to the social use of this language in the different zones of Navarre. Its use is
thus important in the so-called Basque-speaking zone, more limited in the mixed zone and
scarce in the non-Basque-speaking zone of the ‘Foral’ Community.

Regarding the Navarrese Employment Service, the comarca employment services situated
in the Basque-speaking zone (Altsasu-Alsasua and Doneztebe-Santesteban), as well as
those in the mixed zone (Pamplona, which has three offices, Estella and Aoiz) are labelled
in Castilian and Basque.

Besides its geographic location, the Navarrese Employment Service publishes in the
wanted section of its corporate website job offers from companies that include knowledge
of Basque as a candidate requirement. The Navarrese Employment Service also
collaborates in those selection processes.

sub-paragraph d) to facilitate and/or encourage the use of regional or minority languages
by means other than those specified in the above sub-paragraphs.

The Committee of Experts concluded that this undertaking was not fulfilled and urged the
Spanish authorities to explain the current situation in their next periodical report.

Throughout this report the actions taken by the Government of Navarre to
encourage the presence of Basque in teaching have been noted, as both a teaching
language and subject via training offered to all personnel in the education administration,
and by translations and publications in Basque. The promotion of Basque in public
administrations and media outlets, cultural activities and libraries, etc, has been similarly
highlighted.

948

But other examples can be cited. In sports, the use of Basque is promoted in
collaboration with the Provincial Council of Guipúzcoa, increasing labels, signage and the
use of Basque in general. In music, besides all the musical activities programmed in the
2008 Culture Cycles, music contests in Basque are subsidised, gatherings to sing in
Basque are held monthly in the main cities (Pamplona-Iruña, Estella-Lizarra, Cizur MayorZizur Nagusia). Courses and contests have also been subsidised for bertsolaris
[versifiers].

Numerous awareness-raising and communication actions have been addressed to
administrative authorities. A campaign was conducted to foster multi-lingual education,
with an explicit request that it should start with Basque. Plans to augment Basque use in
major commercial establishments, banks and insurance companies and hotels, etc, have
been subsidised in collaboration with municipal Basque language services. Due to a
Euskerabidea initiative about 20 town halls changed the official names of their localities
and included the Basque name in same.

Lastly, the Euskerabidea strategy plan to be approved in the first week of June
encompasses many actions meant to promote Basque in all social and economic contexts.
It was drawn up by representatives elected by the Navarre Basque Language Council and
by the Euskerabidea council of administration. Represents also participated from all the
parliamentary groups and all personnel of the Institute.

Paragraph 2. With regard to economic and social activities, the Parties undertake, in so far
as the public authorities are competent, within the territory in which the regional or minority
languages are used, and as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a) to include in their financial and banking regulations provisions which
allow, by means of procedures compatible with commercial practice, the use of regional or
minority languages in drawing up payment orders (cheques, drafts, etc.) or other financial
documents, or, where appropriate, to ensure the implementation of such provisions;
In Navarrese legislation referring to financial entities the language aspect is not
considered.

949

‘Foral’ Law 18/1986 of 15 December on the Basque language generally establishes
as one of its basic goals “to safeguard the right of citizens to know and use Basque and to
determine the instruments to make this effective”. ‘Foral’ Decree 183/2007 of 10
September, creating the autonomous body Euskerabidea/Navarre Basque Language
Institute, indicates that its general aim is also “to safeguard the right of citizens to know
and use Basque and to determine the instruments to make this effective, and to protect its
recovery and development”.

Inclusion of the use of Basque in financial and banking documents is slow but
gradual. The option for Basque is possible in almost all cash machines and in most cases
automatically activates when the card is introduced if that option was chosen by the card
holder.

As a result of this legislation and steps taken by the Government of Navarre to
promote Basque language use, the main financial institutions operating in Navarre (Caja
Navarra, Caja Laboral, Kutxa, BBK, etc) have made the use of Basque completely normal
in their commercial and financial operations with their clients; the latter are able to choose
the language used to receive all information from the financial institution.

This is nevertheless an issue affecting the scope and decisions of the financial and
banking institutions.

Hence, Caja Navarra or CAN (in Basque – Nafarroako Kutxa), the principal savings bank
of Navarre, chaired by the head of the Navarrese government, offers all its services in
Basque.

sub-paragraph b) in the economic and social sectors directly under their control (public
sector), to organise activities to promote the use of regional or minority languages;

In the financial sector, Caja Navarra is a credit institution of a foundational and benevolentsocial nature under the public protection of the Government of Navarre. To achieve its
aims, it carries out general credit, banking and financial operations for which it is
authorised according to current legislation. Caja Navarra is headed by the president of the
Government of Navarre; its first vice-president is the mayor of Pamplona.
950

Caja Navarra’s website is in Basque. It also allows communications and financial
operations to be conducted in Basque throughout the Community’s territory. Labels and
public attendance are in Basque, at least in the Basque-speaking zone, and all its
publications are issued in Basque.

The Community of the Comarca [administrative region] of Pamplona is one of the
many such communities throughout Navarre which provide certain public services to
citizens. Specifically, it is a local entity formed by 50 municipalities which manages
services associated to the full water cycle, urban waste, urban transportation in the region,
taxis and the waterway park. These services are provided to a population of more than
300,000 people, most of them in the mixed zone. Almost all services are provided in
Basque. Some 50% of customer attendance staff speak Basque. The community’s
invoices, communications, maps and brochures are in Basque and Castilian. Signs and
labels in offices, buses, rubbish containers, etc, are in Castilian and Basque. Programmes
for environmental education, citizens awareness and school ambient education are offered
in Basque and Castilian.

In the other such public service communities in the mixed zone and especially in the
northern part, usage levels of the two languages are similar to those found in the
Community of the Comarca of Pamplona.

sub-paragraph c) to ensure that social care facilities such as hospitals, retirement homes
and hostels offer the possibility of receiving and treating in their own language persons using
a regional or minority language who are in need of care on grounds of ill-health, old age or
for other reasons;

When the Recommendation from the Committee of Experts of the Committee of Ministers
of the Council of Europe on the Charter’s application in Spain was approved in December
2008, Basque was not considered a merit in the far majority of job positions in Navarre’s
health system, nor in homes for the elderly, except for the jobs in those sectors situated in
the Basque-speaking zone.

With a view to view to fully complying with this sub-paragraph the Government of
Navarre, via the Navarre Public Administration Institute, offers extensive, intensive, part951

time, tutored self-learning, internships, review and oral improvement, intensive EGA
preparation and technical courses to staff providing services in hospitals, homes for the
elderly and asylums, etc, so that they can learn Basque. Besides the general call for
admissions in academic year 2009-2010, the Navarre Public Administration Institute is
jointly examining with Euskerabidea the possibility of offering certain training actions in
various health centres, to thereby encourage better attendance. Lastly, Euskerabidea
subsidises private bodies to teach Basque language classes in Navarre; all workers
providing services in hospitals, residences and asylums can attend those centres and also
apply for scholarships to partly defray the cost of enrolling in Basque courses offered by
private entities in Navarre.

Regarding the use of Basque in hospitals

Basque is present in citizens’ relations with the health system.

This circumstance occurs in certain contexts indicated below and results from the
respective Department’s commitment to ensure that all citizens have access to information
of interest for their health in both Castilian and Basque. All published content is therefore
always and proportionally in both languages.

Personnel chapter

Current legislation mandates that a certain number of job positions require knowledge of
this language.

At present, the Navarre Health Service-Osasunbidea counts 53 job positions in which
knowledge of Basque is required (9 urrats) to be eligible for same; all fall under the scope
of Primary Attention. They are:

-

18 Health auxiliaries/qualified nurses

-

16 Primary care doctors

-

8 Administrative auxiliaries

-

5 Primary care paediatricians

-

3 Social workers

-

2 Administrative personnel
952

-

1 Physiotherapist

This circumstance does not prevent the fact that at many attention levels and in different
centres Basque-speaking professionals communicate with patients in their dominant
language.

Teaching

In the different areas of action the possibility of making labour activity compatible with
attending regular language classes at various levels is established and granted.

Labelling/signage

The northern part of the Community, as well as a large part of the Comarca [administrative
region] of Pamplona which includes the hospitals and centres for consultations and
specialised attention, have signs and internal and external static information in Castilian
and Basque shown in parallel.

This includes:
-

Health centres

-

Clinics

-

Hospital of Navarre

-

Virgen del Camino Hospital

-

Ubarmin Clinic

-

Radio-therapy Centre

-

San Francisco Javier Psycho-Geriatric Hospital

-

Attention Centre for Women

-

Mental health centres

-

Transfusion Centre

-

Príncipe de Viana Consultation Centre

-

Dr. San Martín Ambulatory Centre

953

The facilities of the Central Services of the Navarre Health Service, Public Health and the
Breast Cancer Detection Centre and Labour Health are also provided with Basquelanguage information signs.

Patient attendance

Patients are attended in Basque in the zone where that language is dominant.

In zones where Basque language knowledge is not required but there are staff with
knowledge of same, it is provided in that language.

Forms for complaints, applications and justifications for assistance are bilingual.

In certain places and in certain situations coinciding with Basque-speaking staff attention
may be therefore be offered in Basque.

Documentation associated to the Registry

In SNS-O (National Health Service) Central Services, all registration documentation
(general instances, payment cards, etc) have a bilingual version.

Publication of the SNS-O report and tender announcements in the contracting portal are
on the other hand only in Castilian.

Published material

All published material, mainly for activities publicising labour health or public health in
coordination with primary care, as well as materials from the main activity programmes
addressing the population (vaccination, cancer prevention programmes, tobacco, etc) are
released in Castilian and Basque. On occasion and depending on content, they are also
published in other European Community or African languages if deemed necessary).

The Castilian/Basque proportionality is estimated and maintained between 25% and 30%.

954

The published material is distributed in proportions corresponding to the language’s
presence in the geography of the Basque-speaking citizens.

In some cases bilingual material was used in the same proportion in texts for both
languages (Castilian-Basque), with unified and all-encompassing distribution among the
Navarrese population.

Health website

The new “Health Portal” is currently being implemented.

Its consolidation implies the overall unification of content included on the current Public
Health and Labour Health websites and will open new channels in relations with citizens
that include, among others, the project to offer thematic navigation in Basque parallel to
that in Castilian.

This website will hold documentary content from:

-

Primary Care

-

Public Health

-

Labour Health

-

Action Against Tobacco

-

Donations

-

Action Plan Against Drug Addictions

-

Teaching

-

Research

-

Specialised Areas, etc

That is, all types of health information and campaigns of interest for the population in both
languages, including service documents (registrations, instances, etc) and patient
relations.

At present, content exists that can be used in Basque. In the very near future this option
will become widespread.

955

Respect for Basque language use at homes for the elderly.
At centres for the elderly the administration has been assuring Basque language learning
on a general basis for part of the staff by offering courses of diverse nature. The aim is to
ensure good care for users who require same, in both languages.

To ensure that this actually occurs in centres for the elderly where continual care requires
the constant presence of professional staff, the Navarrese Agency for dependence is
endowed each year with a fund to replace personnel who are attending Basque language
courses. Specifically, in the current financial year a total of 65.810.56 euros were set aside
to finance replacements for staff taking such courses.

On the other hand, and bearing in mind that the centres for the elderly maintained by this
administration are in the so-called mixed zone, note that the publicity materials, graphic
campaign material, publications and similar material provided to users at those facilities
are generally produced in Castilian and Basque editions.

Lastly, there is no record of any formal complaint regarding the use of Basque in centres
for the elderly.

sub-paragraph d) to ensure by appropriate means that safety instructions are also drawn
up in regional or minority languages;

956

Various pertinent catalogues have been published in Castilian and Basque, regarding the
planning of preventive company activities, on road safety, workplace postures and load
handling; or regarding health matters, on anti-tobacco plans or about the flu and labour
health.

Sub-paragraph e) to arrange for information provided by the competent public authorities
concerning the rights of consumers to be made available in regional or minority languages.

The Committee of Experts considered that this undertaking was not fulfilled because the
Navarrese authorities had not provided the respective information and because nongovernmental sources informed the Committee of Experts that ‘Foral’ Law 7/2006 on
Consumer and User Protection had been published and distributed throughout Navarre
only in Castilian. Stocks of that publication are currently exhausted.

The Government of Navarre has informed that its Consumer Service is carried out by staff
fully able to serve the public in either of the Community’s two languages. The lawyer who
draws up the legal reports can likewise carry out his duties in Basque and Castilian. All
persons who go to the Consumer Service to request a copy of the ‘Foral’ Law on

961

Consumer and User Protection have at their disposal identical copies of that law in Basque
and Castilian from the Navarre Official Gazette. When the ‘Foral’ Law is republished a
bilingual version or separate versions on Castilian and Basque will be published.

The Consumer Service forms and complaint sheets are available in bilingual
versions. The posters announcing the availability of complaint sheets are bilingual. The
Consumer Service has this legislative term started producing a magazine devoted to
training, informing and educating school users and consumers; the magazine is entirely in
two languages, Basque and Castilian.

By way of all the above, it seems that the competent authorities fulfil the
undertaking to facilitate information about consumer rights in Basque.

APPLICATION OF ARTICLE. 14 TRANSFRONTIER EXCHANGES.

The Parties undertake:
sub-paragraph a) to apply existing bilateral and multilateral agreements which bind them
with the States in which the same language is used in identical or similar form, or if
necessary to seek to conclude such agreements, in such a way as to foster contacts
between the users of the same language in the States concerned in the fields of culture,
education, information, vocational training and permanent education;

The Framework Agreement signed by the Government of the Kingdom of Spain and the
Government of the French Republic published in the BOE [official gazette] on 11 July 2005
on education, language and culture programmes at school institutions in the two States
refers exclusively to the Spanish and French languages and makes no reference
whatsoever to the co-official languages.

sub-paragraph b) for the benefit of regional or minority languages, to facilitate and/or
promote co-operation across borders, in particular between regional or local authorities in
whose territory the same language is used in identical or similar form.

962

The Government of Navarre has been encouraging actions to increase transfrontier
collaboration with France in the northern part of Navarre which borders on that country
(163 km). Given that Basque is spoken on both sides of the Pyrenees, this collaboration
extends, beyond the cultural context, to the scope of language as well.

In France, the Public Office for the Basque Language was created in 2004. It is a public
interest group comprising the French State, the Region, the Department and town
halls. It is the first instrument authorised by the French State to group all the public
powers around a project, pioneering in France, regarding language policy in favour of
Basque.

Euskerabidea has been working with the above-mentioned Public Office for the
Basque Language to draw up a collaboration agreement that may also include the Basque
Government and which covers various topics associated to Basque such as academic
titles, recognition of titles and socio-linguistic research, etc. Meetings and work sessions
have been held to exchange materials and documentation.

The Government of Navarre has signed a Transfrontier Cooperation Agreement with
the Regional Council of Aquitaine, under which aid is annually awarded by processes
in each of the regions.

o Cultural activities on Basque which received aid:
2006 process. Ascarat camp organised by the entity Sortzen Gurasoak.
2007 process:
•

ASI. Song contest and activities associated to herding.

•

Xorroxin and the town hall of Isaba. Song contest “kantu
txapelketa” and rural sports.

2008 process:
o Ibañeta III project.

The ITINERIS programme. Inserted in a transfrontier cooperation programme
associated to a programme 50% subsidised by FEDER funds from the European Union
which promotes cooperation between frontier regions, lifelong learning by personnel of
European languages and the exchange of good practices between counterpart agents
in the administrations of Navarre and Aquitaine.
963

The Government of Navarre’s implementation of this programme in 2002 involved
participation in European programmes, with the goal of taking part in the new programmes
due to be applied for the 2007-2013 period.
•

Regarding the management of cultural programmes, note the following with respect to
PIC INTERREG III A France-Spain:

The Government of Navarre is leading 6 PIC projects in the INTERREG III A
framework for France-Spain with FEDER funding of €490,904.46 and partners from the
Aquitaine Region.

As in other community programmes, the management of this cultural programme
co-financed per the INTERREG initiative is carried out by means of the following
instruments:

-

Monitoring committees: Decisions are made on the Community Initiative Programme.
Have taken place on: 11 December 2003, 17 July 2003, 15 July 2004, 17 February

The Pyrenees Labour Community is a European regional association grouping the four
964

Spanish Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country, F.C. of Navarre, Catalonia
and Aragon and the three French regions bordering the Pyrenees. Its work consists of
holding an annual plenary meeting and the work of the various Committees; the
language question is the responsibility of the so-called Committee III.

Committee III covers the areas of culture, youth and sports, as well as various
ongoing projects such as compiling an oral heritage collection, organising a show of young
artists from the Pyrenees, continuing common activities associated to mountain-climbing
and winter sports, creating a network of working camps in the Pyrenees or holding a
seminar of partners to schedule youth exchanges, with the corresponding language
content contributed by the participants in those activities.

3.5. ARANESE IN CATALONIA

INTRODUCTION

The statutory declaration of the Occitan language, called Aranese in the Arán Valley, as
official language in Catalonia means that it has automatically become part of the bloc of
languages recognised in the first paragraph of Spain’s declaration with respect to article 2
paragraph 2 and article 3 paragraph 1 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages done in Strasbourg on 5 November 1992, and is no longer merely protected
per the second paragraph of that same declaration.

The extent and effects of its official status will nevertheless be developed by a subsequent
law approved in the Parliament of Catalonia. Also, the State of Catalonia does not endow
the same degree of official status for Aranese with respect to Catalan or Castilian, by
establishing the following provisions:

“Article 6. The own language and the official languages.

1. Catalonia's own language is Catalan. As such, Catalan is the language of normal
and preferential use in Public Administration bodies and in the public media of
Catalonia, and is also the language of normal use for teaching and learning in the
education system.

2. Catalan is the official language of Catalonia, together with Castilian, the official
language of the Spanish State. All persons have the right to use the two official
languages and citizens of Catalonia have the right and the duty to know them.

5. The Occitan language, known as Aranese in Aran, is Aran's own language and is
official in Catalonia, as established by this Estatut and by the laws of linguistic
normalisation.

966

Article 36. Rights concerning Aranese.

1. In Aran each individual has the right to know and use Aranese and to be attended
orally and in writing in Aranese in his or her dealings with the Public Administration
bodies and public and private entities accountable to them.
2. The citizens of Aran have the right to use Aranese in their dealings with the
Generalitat.
3. Other linguistic rights and obligations relating to Aranese shall be determined by
law.”

One must therefore await legal development of these precepts to ascertain the territorial
scope of the declaration of Aranese as official language.

Application of article 8. Education.

Paragraph 1. With regard to education, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
such languages are used, according to the situation of each of these languages, and without
prejudice to the teaching of the official language(s) of the State:
Measures paragraph 1:
sub-paragraph a, i): to make available pre-school education in the relevant regional or
minority languages;
Decree 181/2008 of 9 September, on the planning of teaching for the second cycle of preschool education, establishes the following:
Article 4
4.2 Aranese, a variant of the Occitan language, is taught in the Aran Valley in
accordance with what the General Council of the Aran Valley and the Department of
Education determine.

sub-paragraph b, i): to make available primary education in the relevant regional or
minority languages; or

Primary education: Decree 142/2007 of 26 June, on planning the teaching for primary
education, which deploys the new curriculums, provides that:
967

Article 6
“The Occitan language in Era Val d'Aran
“Aranese, a variant of the Occitan language, is taught in Era Val d’Aran with
temporary assignments and in the scopes of learning and areas determined by the
General Council of Era Val d’Aran, in accordance with the Department of Education
(of the Generalitat of Catalonia).”

Sub-paragraph c, i): to make available secondary education in the relevant regional or
minority languages;
The presence of Aranese in secondary education is regulated in an identical manner.
Hence, article 5 of Decree 143/2007 of 26 June, on the planning of reaching for obligatory
secondary education, is expressed in the same terms as described above:
“article 5
The Occitan language in the Aran Valley
Aranese, a variant of the Occitan language, is taught in the Aran Valley with
temporary assignments and in the scopes of learning and areas determined by the
General Council of the Aran Valley, in accordance with the Department of Education
(of the Generalitat of Catalonia).”
Decree 142/2008 of 15 July likewise establishes the planning for baccalaureate education,
providing the following:
"Article 4
2. Aranese, a variant of the Occitan language, is taught in Era Val d’Aran with
temporary assignments and in the scopes of learning and areas determined by the
General Council of Era Val d’Aran, in accordance with the Department of
Education.”
The tangible presence of the Occitan language (Aranese) in the curricular plan for
education in the Aran Valley is accomplished by Resolution ENS/526/2003 of 6
March, which publicises the Agreement between the Department of Education and
the Aran General Council to determine the number of Aranese language credits and
areas to be taught in Aranese in obligatory secondary education, and is expressed
as follows:

968

“To adjust the process already begun to the new plan so that the Aranese language
can be the normal language of use and learning in obligatory secondary education,
both parties (the Department of Education of the Generalitat of Catalonia and the
General Council of Aran) agree:

One. Teaching of the Aranese language
The Aranese language shall be taught in all obligatory secondary education
courses.

The credits assigned to each of the languages Aranese, Catalonian and Castilian
shall be two credits for each of the course levels. One credit will also be given for
common language structures in each course of the level.

Two. Teaching in Aranese language
Beginning in academic year 2002-2003 two areas in the first and third course of the
stage will be taught in Aranese, besides the Aranese language. In academic year
2003-2004 the second and fourth courses of the same areas shall also be taught in
Aranese.

Three. Progressive implementation of teaching in Aranese language
Besides the language credits, the point will gradually be reached where 40% of the
stage’s credits use the Aranese language as teaching language.”

Four. Joint monitoring.

The Directorate General of Educational Innovation and Planning, the Inspectorate
for Teaching and the Office for the Promotion and Teaching of Aranese of the
General Council of Aran will monitor and evaluate the implementation of teaching in
the Aranese language, specifically in order to obtain information that enables a
future permanent standard to be drawn up regarding the teaching of Aranese and in
Aranese.”

In accordance with the legal and regulatory framework, during the three-year period
covered by the report Occitan (Aranese) was the language habitually used for

969

communication in all the primary education institutions. Also, approximately a third of the
teaching disciplines were taught in this language.
Regarding secondary education, a minimum of two hours in the obligatory schooling stage
from 12 to 16 years of age was taught in Occitan language (Aranese). Some subjects were
also given in that language, such as natural sciences, in the first and second year of
obligatory secondary education (ESO).
In the baccalaureate programme, the Occitan language (Aranese) is an optional subject.
On the other hand, note that the General Council of Aran encourages the presence of
Aranese (Occitan language) in the school phase, by promoting publication of the following
material:
-

Textbooks and readers in Aranese are re-published annually and the translation of
textbooks into Aranese is coordinated;

-

Pre-school, primary and secondary education agendas in Aranese;

-

Pre-school magazines with content addressed to pupils from 3 to 8 years old
(Papagai) and from 8 to 12 years old (Plumalhon).

The Aranese government also holds a theatre festival in the school and a literary contest
for children from 9 to 17 years old, called the Concurso Literario Mossen Condó Sambeat.

Finally, we note the action taken by the General Council of Aran in contracting
conversation auxiliaries to augment use of the Occitan language (Aranese) in classrooms
and patios (recess periods).

sub-paragraph d, i): to make available technical and vocational education in the relevant
regional or minority languages;
In accordance with basic state legislation (Organic Law 1/1990 of 3 Octobre, on general
planning of the education system), the Autonomous Communities with assumed powers
are responsible for adjusting studies to socio-economic circumstances by establishing the
curriculums for vocational education.
Based on this base legislation, the Generalitat of Catalonia legally regulated unregulated
education and specifically vocational training in Decree 332/1994 of 4 November,
establishing the general plan for specific vocational training studies in Catalonia.
Article 6 of the aforementioned Decree 332/1994 provides, with respect to languages used
in vocational training, the following:
“6.1.Catalan, as the own language of Catalonia, is as well for vocational education. It shall
be the normal language used for teaching and learning.
970

6.2. In accordance with representative bodies from the Aran Valley, the content to be
taught in Aranese at teaching centres in the Aran Valley shall be determined;
6.3. In any case, the individual language rights of the student shall be respected, as per
current legislation”.

sub-paragraph e, iii): if, by reason of the role of the State in relation to higher education
institutions, sub-paragraphs i and ii cannot be applied, to encourage and/or allow the
provision of university or other forms of higher education in regional or minority languages or
of facilities for the study of these languages as university or higher education subjects;

The public university of Lleida offers studies in Occitan language and literature. The
entrance into force of new university degree titles within the framework of the new
European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has caused that university’s degree in Catalan
Philology to become a degree in Catalan and Occitan Studies, whereby Occitan language
and literature has joined Catalan philological studies.

sub-paragraph f, i): to arrange for the provision of adult and continuing education courses
which are taught mainly or wholly in the regional or minority languages;

The General Council of Aran organises Aranese courses at oral (A and A1) and written (B
and C) levels in the Aran Valley, as well as in Barcelona. The courses are offered in
mornings, afternoons and evenings, to ensure that language training can be reconciled
with the schedules of potentially interested students.
Besides this generic offer, language training is offered to certain groups such as the
Mossos d’Esquadra-Police of the Generalitat who provide service in the Aran Valley.
An online learning course is currently being prepared and should be available for
academic year 2009-2010; the General Council of Aran has budged €13,600 for same.
For its part the Generalitat of Catalonia has subsidised the activity of the Occitan/Catalan
Fraternal Centre, consisting of offering Occitan language courses in Catalonian territory
outside the Aran Valley. These are language courses for adults, to which the European
reference framework is applied.

971

sub-paragraph g: to make arrangements to ensure the teaching of the history and the
culture which is reflected by the regional or minority language;

In all curricular paths at the various levels of education detailed in the sub-paragraphs above
the teaching of Catalan and Aranese history and culture is included.

sub-paragraph h: to provide the basic and further training of the teachers required to
implement those of paragraphs a to g accepted by the Party;

With respect to the Occitan language (Aranese), Decree 244/1991 of 28 October on
knowledge of official languages for the assignment of teaching positions in non-university
public education centres in Catalonia, accountable to the Department of Education,
knowledge of Aranese must be accredited for teaching positions in the Aran Valley.

sub-paragraph i: to set up a supervisory body or bodies responsible for monitoring the
measures taken and progress achieved in establishing or developing the teaching of
regional or minority languages and for drawing up periodic reports of their findings, which
will be made public.

As the Occitan language (Aranese) is a curricular subject for education, it is evaluated
systematically at each educational level.

Paragraph 2: With regard to education and in respect of territories other than those in which
the regional or minority languages are traditionally used, the Parties undertake, if the
number of users of a regional or minority language justifies it, to allow, encourage or provide
teaching in or of the regional or minority language at all the appropriate stages of education.

Application of article 9

Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, in respect of those judicial districts in which the
number of residents using the regional or minority languages justifies the measures
specified below, according to the situation of each of these languages and on condition that
972

the use of the facilities afforded by the present paragraph is not considered by the judge to
hamper the proper administration of justice:

Occitan (Aranese) in the Justice administration situated in the Aran Valley

a) in criminal proceedings:
sub-paragraph a.i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph a, ii): to guarantee the accused the right to use his/her regional or minority
language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iii): to provide that requests and evidence, whether written or oral, shall
not be considered inadmissible solely because they are formulated in a regional or minority
language; and/or

sub-paragraph a, iv): to produce, on request, documents connected with legal proceedings
in the relevant regional or minority language, if necessary by the use of interpreters and
translations involving no extra expense for the persons concerned;

b) in civil proceedings:
sub-paragraph b, i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph b, ii): to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court,
that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring
additional expense; and/or

973

sub-paragraph b, iii): to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations

c) in proceedings before courts concerning administrative matters:
sub-paragraph c, i): to provide that the courts, at the request of one of the parties, shall
conduct the proceedings in the regional or minority languages; and/or

sub-paragraph c, ii): to allow, whenever a litigant has to appear in person before a court,
that he or she may use his or her regional or minority language without thereby incurring
additional expense; and/or

sub-paragraph c, iii): to allow documents and evidence to be produced in the regional or
minority languages, if necessary by the use of interpreters and translations;

sub-paragraph d: to take steps to ensure that the application of sub-paragraphs i and iii of
paragraphs b and c above and any necessary use of interpreters and translations does not
involve extra expense for the persons concerned.

In 2001 a still valid agreement was signed by the Generalitat of Catalonia, the General
Council of Aran and the General Council of the Judiciary to linguistically normalise the office
of the Judicial Party of Biela (Aran’s capital). Due to that agreement, the Generalitat of
Catalonia is obliged to:
•

Maintain knowledge of Aranese (Occitan language) as a merit in the process
to select interns for Justice administration service;

•

Provide materials and language advice enabling the Aran Valley jurisdiction to
use Aranese (Occitan) when the parties in litigation so request from the
Justice administration.

For its part, the General Council of Aran (local government) pledges to place at the disposal
of the titular judge philological advice and training in Aranese that enables linguistic
normalisation to be guaranteed.
This agreement is meant to provide the Justice administration in Aran with advice and
material needed to train judges, who should thus allow the language to be used if the parties
in litigation so request.
The first ruling in Aranese dates to 2001, although it is still used very infrequently in written
judgments.
974

Paragraph 2: The Parties undertake:
sub-paragraph a: not to deny the validity of legal documents drawn up within the State
solely because they are drafted in a regional or minority language;

Catalan Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Language Policy guarantees in its article 14 the rights
of citizens to choose the language in which they want public documents they intervene in
to be written. For its part, article 7 of the same law establishes that “Aranese, a variety of
the Occitan language native to the Aran Valley, is governed (...) additionally by the
precepts of this Law, which can never be interpreted in detriment to the use of Aranese”.
Decree 204/1998 of 30 July regulates use of the Catalan and Occitan languages in notary
documents, developing that legal provision. The regulation is detailed with respect to
language choice, validity in case of doubt between the two versions or the copies to make.
Among its precepts, the following stand out:
“Article 1
1.1 In Catalonia notary documents must be written in the official language that the grantor
chooses or, if there is more than one grantor, in the language they agree on;
1.2 Before writing the document, and at the moment of being commissioned to write it, the
grantor(s) or their representatives must explicitly be asked which language they choose; in
no case can the choice of one or another language delay the writing and authorising of the
document. If the language is not explicitly chosen, the document will be written in Catalan;
1.3 When there is more than one grantor and deeds to transfer property or rights are
involved, or the constitution of a loan or credit formulated in line with general contracting
conditions, the right to choose the language corresponds to the acquirer or borrower.

Article 2
2.1 Without prejudice to the provisions of article 1.3 above, if there is no agreement
between the grantors with respect to language, then the deed is granted in both official
languages,...
Additional Provision
Two: In Era Val d’Aran (the Aran Valley), what this decree mandates for the Catalan
language is also applicable to Aranese, and what this decree mandates for the Castilian
language is applicable to Castilian and Catalan. However, the original will only be written
in Aranese if all signatories manifest their familiarity with same”.

975

State legislation for the sector must be added to that Autonomous Community regulation
from 1998, as the new Regulation on the notary system and its organisation approved by
Royal Decree 45/2007 of 19 January establishes in its articles 149 and 150 an identical
regime of free choice of official language ion each territory in which public documents are
brought before a notary to be granted. In Catalonia it implies, in the wake of the 2006
Statute, the possibility of choosing between Castilian, Catalan and Occitan, especially in
Aran.

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to make available in the regional or minority languages
the most important national statutory texts and those relating particularly to users of these
languages, unless they are otherwise provided.

Occitan in the Official Gazette of the Generalitat (DOGC – Diario Oficial de la
Generalitat de Catalunya)

Law 2/2007 of 5 June of the DOGC determines the following in its article 4:

“Article 4. DOGC language of publication
The DOGC is published in Catalan and Castilian, and the rules, provisions and acts which
exclusively affect Aran will also be published in Aranese. The three versions have official
status.”

It must nevertheless be noted that this legal provision does not imply the start of
publication in Aranese of the legal provisions of the Generalitat of Catalonia that affect the
territory where that language is spoken. The transcribed legal precept actually implies a
transposition of the regulation contained in Decree 254/1987 of 4 August, which was
expressed in identical terms.

Application of article 10. Administrative authorities and public services.

Paragraph 1. Within the administrative districts of the State in which the number of
residents who are users of regional or minority languages justifies the measures specified
below and according to the situation of each language, the Parties undertake, as far as this
is reasonably possible:
976

sub-paragraph a, i): to ensure that the administrative authorities use the regional or
minority languages;

The legal framework guarantees language training for civil servants and enables use of the
Occitan language before the local administrations of Aran.

sub-paragraph b: to make available widely used administrative texts and forms for the
population in the regional or minority languages or in bilingual versions;

Use of Aranese in the General State Administration.

-

Ministry of the Presidency

Documents from the different electoral processes are translated into Occitan (Aranese) and
published in trilingual version, even though the public services of the General State
Administration do not use Aranese.

-

Ministry of the Interior

With respect to electoral material, on the web page designed by this Ministry for the 2007
local elections, the 2008 national legislative [Cortes Generales] elections and the 2009
elections for the Parliament, the manuals for members of the electoral board were
available in Castilian, bilingual and, in the case of the Aran Valley (Lleida), trilingual
versions.

sub-paragraph c: to allow the administrative authorities to draft documents in a regional or
minority language.

PARAGRAPH 2: In respect of the local and regional authorities on whose territory the
number of residents who are users of regional or minority languages is such as to justify the
measures specified below, the Parties undertake to allow and/or encourage:

977

sub-paragraph a: the use of regional or minority languages within the framework of the
regional or local authority;

The linguistic competence of employees of the public administrations
With respect to the Occitan language (Aranese), the Generalitat of Catalonia offers by
means of the Public Administration School language training for Catalan civil servants, at
either Autonomous Community or local level. This training consists of 40-hour courses
meant to endow the Generalitat with its own staff with sufficient language skills to attend to
the Aranese citizens in their language, if they so desire. This teaching activity began in
2007 and continued in 2008 at the level of beginners’, oral and written courses.

This Occitan language training is complemented by conferences and seminars also
organised by the Public Administration School, where the new official status of Aran’s own
language has been disseminated, along with its linguistic affiliation to the Occitan
language, socio-linguistic situation and available language resources (in particular, the
automatic Catalan-Occitan/Aranese and Castilian-Occitan/Aranese translator), as well as
the rights and duties of citizens with respect to use of this language before public
administrations.

The training described up to this point corresponds to what the Generalitat offers to
Autonomous Community and local civil servants throughout Catalonia and should
complement what the local government of Aran, the General Council, does for the
administrations of that territory.

Indeed, the General Council of Aran carries out duties to advise and inform and also offers
a translation and correction service for administrative documents to all public institutions
that request same. In 2007 it also offered a Catalan course focusing on administrative
language and addressed to public bodies in Aran, and distributed a publication containing
model administrative forms.

The Aran General Council also organises courses for staff of the town halls of Aran.

Finally, the Aranese administration translates notices, resolutions and decrees published
in the official gazette of the Generalitat of Catalonia (DOGC). It also corrects transcriptions

978

of the speeches in this language given in the Parliament of Catalonia. Note, in this regard,
that Aranese can be used by members of the regional legislature without translation.

sub-paragraph b: the possibility for users of regional or minority languages to submit oral
or written applications in these languages;

In Aran, the Generalitat uses the Occitan language (Aranese) in administrative
publications, printed material and written communications. The Aranese government, the
General Council of Aran, as well as the town halls, likewise use Aranese on a habitual
basis.

sub-paragraph c: the publication by regional authorities of their official documents also in
the relevant regional or minority languages

The laws of the Parliament of Catalonia, as well as the legislation of Catalan
administrations, are approved and published in Catalan. As set out in Law 2/2007 of 5
June of the DOGC in its article 4, they are also published in Castilian, and the provisions
particularly affecting the territory of Aran are published in Aranese as well.
sub-paragraph d: the publication by local authorities of their official documents also in the
relevant regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph e: the use by regional authorities of regional or minority languages in
debates in their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s)
of the State;

In the Parliament of Catalonia, Catalan, Castilian and Aranese can be used freely. The
Regulations of Parliament do not expressly envisage this, but in practice its sessions are
almost entirely carried out in Catalan.

sub-paragraph f: the use by local authorities of regional or minority languages in debates in
their assemblies, without excluding, however, the use of the official language(s) of the State;

979

sub-paragraph g: the use or adoption, if necessary in conjunction with the name in the
official language(s), of traditional and correct forms of place-names in regional or minority
languages.

PARAGRAPH 3: With regard to public services provided by the administrative authorities or
other persons acting on their behalf, the Parties undertake, within the territory in which
regional or minority languages are used, in accordance with the situation of each language
and as far as this is reasonably possible:

sub-paragraph a: to ensure that the regional or minority languages are used in the
provision of the service; or

sub-paragraph b: to allow users of regional or minority languages to submit a request and
receive a reply in these languages;

PARAGRAPH 4: With a view to putting into effect those provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3
accepted by them, the Parties undertake to take one or more of the following measures:

sub-paragraph a: translation or interpretation as may be required;

sub-paragraph b: recruitment and, where necessary, training of the officials and other
public service employees required;

sub-paragraph c: compliance as far as possible with requests from public service
employees having a knowledge of a regional or minority language to be appointed in the
territory in which that language is used.
PARAGRAPH 5: The Parties undertake to allow the use or adoption of family names in the
regional or minority languages, at the request of those concerned.

Application of article 11. Media

Paragraph 1. The Parties undertake, for the users of the regional or minority languages
within the territories in which those languages are spoken, according to the situation of each
980

language, to the extent that the public authorities, directly or indirectly, are competent, have
power or play a role in this field, and respecting the principle of the independence and
autonomy of the media:

sub-paragraph a, i): to the extent that radio and television carry out a public service
mission: to ensure the creation of at least one radio station and one television channel in the
8

regional or minority languages ;

The legislation of Catalonia regulates in a parallel and fair form the presence of the
Catalan language with that of the Aranese or Occitan language in the Aran Valley. Hence,
the protection Catalan receives is also offered to the own language of Aran in its territory.
Currently valid legislation in this context is detailed below:
Law 1/1998 of 7 January on Language Policy provides in its article 25, concerning public
television and radio broadcasting media, that “3. The Catalan Radio and Television
Corporation should seek to ensure regular programming of radio and television broadcasts
in Aranese to the Aran Valley. (...) 6. The public broadcasters mentioned in this article
which broadcast or distribute to the Aran Valley should guarantee a significant presence of
Aranese in their programming.”
For its part, Law 22/2005 of 29 December, concerning audiovisual communication in
Catalonia, establishes the following in its article 52 concerning the criteria for awarding
licences for audiovisual media:
“1.- The Catalonia Audiovisual Council should evaluate the offers submitted according to
the following criteria:
(..) b) The extent of Catalan use and the promotion and dissemination of Catalan culture
and, where appropriate, of Aranese.”
Also noteworthy is article 86 of the same Law 22/2005 mentioned above, on the
obligations with respect to the presence of the Catalan language and culture and of
Aranese in audiovisual communication, which establishes the following:
“1. The language normally used by the audiovisual communication service providers
should be Catalan, and in the Aran Valley should be Aranese. Exceptionally, the
characteristics of the target audience can be taken into account, per criteria established by
the Catalonia Audiovisual Council by Instruction, in the framework of the provisions of
language legislation.
2. The audiovisual communication service providers submitted to the licence system are
governed by the obligations set by language policy legislation with respect to the holders
981

of private radio and television concessions. In the Aran Valley the same obligations should
be observed for Aranese as are established for Catalan.
3. In accordance with the terms prescribed by this Law, the distributors of audiovisual
communication services should ensure that most of the channels they offer are in Catalan
and in the Aran Valley in Aranese”.
Regarding actions undertaken during the report’s three-year period, noteworthy was the
increased programming in Occitan (Aranese) on public radio stations of the Generalitat of
Catalonia, which rose from two to two-and-a-half hours per day, with the production of a
morning news bulletin in this own language of Aran.
For its part, Catalonia Television continued to broadcast 15 minutes of weekly
programming in Occitan. During this three-year period programmes were also broadcast
using a dual Catalan/Occitan system (football relays, reports, etc).
The private concession television of the Generalitat of Catalonia for its part produces a
weekly 15-minutes programme in Occitan. This programme is broadcast twice per week.
In the DTT implementation programme, the Generalitat of Catalonia programmed a
multiplex channel solely for the Aran Valley. The public tender was won by a local
consortium comprising the town halls of Vielha e Mijaran, Bossòst and Naut Aran.

sub-paragraph b, i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one radio station
in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph c, i) to encourage and/or facilitate the creation of at least one television
channel in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph d: to encourage and/or facilitate the production and distribution of audio
and audiovisual works in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph e, i): to encourage and/or facilitate the creation and/or maintenance of at
least one newspaper in the regional or minority languages;

The aid the Catalan administration grants to the press has been stimulated by the
Generalitat of Catalonia since 1983 as a mechanism to compensate for the situation of
disadvantage inherent to the reduced size of the Catalan language market for companies
982

and publishers. It involves automatic assistance for the publication and commercialisation
of print media in Catalan or Aranese, with a view to strengthening the productive and
territorial fabric of the Catalan press, using production as a calculation parameter and
taking regularity, territorial coverage and legal status of the publisher into account.

The most important line has been the automatic aid for publishing and commercialising
periodicals in Catalan or Aranese. The second line provides economic aid to projects that
consolidate companies involved in journalism and to extending the press in Catalan or
Aranese.
Regarding the print media, note that the Generalitat of Catalonia subsidised a lead media,
Diario Segre, to produce a monthly magazine called “Aran ath dia” to be distributed
throughout Catalonia. It has been published throughout this report’s three-year analysis
period.
sub-paragraph f, ii): to apply existing measures for financial assistance also to audiovisual
productions in the regional or minority languages;

sub-paragraph g: to support the training of journalists and other staff for media using
regional or minority languages.

Paragraph 2: The Parties undertake to guarantee freedom of direct reception of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in a language used in identical or similar
form to a regional or minority language, and not to oppose the retransmission of radio and
television broadcasts from neighbouring countries in such a language. They further
undertake to ensure that no restrictions will be placed on the freedom of expression and free
circulation of information in the written press in a language used in identical or similar form to
a regional or minority language. The exercise of the above-mentioned freedoms, since it
carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions,
restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society,
in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of
disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or
rights of others, for preventing disclosure of information received in confidence, or for
maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

983

Paragraph 3: The Parties undertake to ensure that the interests of the users of regional or
minority languages are represented or taken into account within such bodies as may be
established in accordance with the law with responsibility for guaranteeing the freedom and
pluralism of the media.

The Catalonia Audiovisual Council
The Catalonia Audiovisual Council is the independent regulatory authority for public and
private audiovisual communication in Catalonia, as set out in article 82 of the 2006 Statute
of Autonomy, which covers what was already set in Law 2/2000 of 4 May on the Catalonia
Audiovisual Council and in Law 22/2005 of 29 December on audiovisual communication in
Catalonia.
Specifically, the law on creation of the Audiovisual Council (Law 2/2000) charges it, in the
scope of its activity, with safeguarding linguistic and cultural plurality throughout the
audiovisual system in Catalonia and particularly to comply with legislation concerning the
preservation and normalisation of the Catalan language and culture and Aranese.
To carry out its activity and per its powers, the Catalonia Audiovisual Council approved
Accord 118/2004 of 17 November, which contains the general instruction on the presence
of the Catalan language and culture and of Aranese in the audiovisual media (DOGC no.
4281 of 16 December). This instruction, which began to be applied in 2005, was revised;
after the sector was consulted a new version was approved in late 2007: the General
Instruction of the Audiovisual Council of Catalonia on the presence of the Catalan
language and culture and of Aranese in the audiovisual media (Accord 295/2007 of 19
December concerning the Catalonia Audiovisual Council, DOGC no. 5037 of 28
December).
As for music sung in Catalan, the legal obligation is to ensure a sufficient presence of
same and that at least 25% of songs should be in Catalan or Aranese (art. 3e and art. 4.1,
art. 5.e and art 6.2). This can be subject to modification after the 2007 Instruction takes
effect.
Noteworthy since 2007 has been the tender (Accord 297/2007 of the Catalonia
Audiovisual Council) call to award concessions for the private operation of 83 frequency
modulated radio frequencies. This tender’s specification clauses include one that sets
value on improving broadcasts in the Catalan language and, if appropriate, in Aranese,
above the legal prescriptions, with a maxim of up to 100 points.

984

Generalitat of Catalonia subsidies to promote the Catalan and Occitan (Aranese)
languages in the media.

The Generalitat of Catalonia has encouraged and supported for many years the presence
of Catalan in media in the territorial scope of Catalonia, and of Aranese in Aran. When
Occitan (Aranese) was declared official, the language promotion policies for the media
were thereby also extended to that language, from 2008 on.

The subsidies the Generalitat of Catalonia publicly awards every year are for:
radio and television stations and journalism enterprises publishers of digital press in
Catalan or Aranese, privately run;
privately owned television stations in Catalan or Aranese;
privately owned radio stations in Catalan or Aranese;
radio stations in Catalan or Aranes pertaining to private companies, for projects that
promote and consolidate the Catalan communication space;

educational institutions in Catalonia and Occitania to effect a school exchange each year.

The Department of Education of the Generalitat of Catalonia has likewise signed agreements
with the rectors of academies in southern France to promote these exchanges.

Complementary final information

989

The information included below also enables consideration in the report the Charter
articles mentioned above.

The draft Law on Aranese (Occitan)

The draft Law on Aranese being processed by the Catalan Parliament for its debate and
approval, responds to the statutory mandate concerning legal development of the official
status of Aranese or Occitan. The text was drawn up by the Language Policy Secretariat of
the Generalitat of Catalonia, in consensus with the Aran General Council. After being
submitted for informative purposes and public hearing, it was approved by the Government
of the Generalitat last 22 December 2009.

The draft Law thus responds to the need to adjust the legal framework of Occitan or
Aranese to the new Statute of Autonomy; to the aim of fulfilling the undertakings
established by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; and to the
purpose of updating and endowing with more unity and coherence the legal system
governing Occitan or Aranese, which is today regulated by dispersed and fragmented
rules that project a certain ambiguity over the language’s status and identity.

The draft Law’s general objectives are as follows:

-

to protect Aranese in all contexts and sectors. Regarding the protection level, the
criterion inspiring the Law is extension of the legal system governing Aranese as
the own language of Aran and official in Catalonia to the very content of these
principles in the Catalonian linguistic order. A generous outlook has therefore been
taken vis-à-vis development of the statutory mandates, enabling lawmakers to
determine the scope, use and legal effects of the official status of Aranese and to
frame the process of linguistic normalisation. The social and demographic reality of
this language nevertheless imposes certain conditions reflected by the legal
regulation via corresponding modulations. The concentration of Aranese speakers
in the Aran Valley, along with its nature as an own language, justifies the
establishment of more intense protection in this territory than in the rest of
Catalonia;

-

to promote the use of Aranese, for which purpose the draft Law gives broad legal
990

coverage to the measures to foster and disseminate Aranese in all ambits and
sectors. Among other aspects, it envisages the means needed to manage the
linguistic impact of new social phenomena such as rising immigration, or to boost
the presence of Aranese in media and information outlets. In line with what is
established in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the text
also facilitates collaboration with the rest of Occitania, which may result in the
adoption of measures to promote the Occitan language.

-

to work together to protect the unity of the Occitan language. Currently the most
widespread legislative reference, maintaining the same criteria as the Normas
Ortografiques der Aranés approved by the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1983, is the
one compiled by Loís Alibèrt in the Gramatica Occitana published in Catalonia in
1935 and re-published by the Institut d’Estudis Catalans in 2000. With the boost
from relations with other Occitan-speaking territories, the standard may help foster
the development of actions to regulate and establish guidelines for Occitan. The
Aran General Council should likewise have the possibility of promoting the study
and determining ambits for the use of Aranese.

These goals are pursued in an article regulating the following content of the form briefly
summarised below:

-

Development of the official status of Aranese and the language rights associated
to same. The draft law develops the principle of own language applied to Aranese in
Aran, which obliges the public authorities and institutions to protect it, use it a
general manner and promote its public use at all levels. For its part, the legal
category of official language, with respect to Aranese guarantees a number of
general language rights before all administrations in the territory of Aran, and of the
Generalitat throughout Catalonia. The above principles are complemented by
affirmation of the willingness to enhance the unity of the Occitan language vis-à-vis
relations with the other Occitan-speaking territories and groups. Bearing these
principles in mind, the text regulates the official use of Aranese, and establishes
measures to protect and promote usage to achieve its normalisation, a well as
measures to foster its presence in all ambits;

-

Regulation of the institutional use of Aranese. The draft Law establishes that the
991

Aranese administrations and institutions should preferably use Aranese and that the
services and bodies accountable to the Generalitat in Aran should also normally
use it in their administrative relations and to provide information to citizens, without
prejudicing the citizens’ right to choose another official language. Outside of Aran, it
acknowledges the citizens’ right to use and be attended to in Aranese in written
relations with the administration of the Generalitat of Catalonia, and also to use it
and be answered orally in the unified information service. The Generalitat should
therefore adopt pertinent measures to guarantee this. It also proclaims the full
validity of all public and private documents written in Aranese, without prejudicing
the rights of citizens with respect to other official languages, and envisages
eventually signing agreements with other state bodies to normalise use of the
language.

-

Names: The draft law acknowledges the exclusive status of the Aranese
denomination for place names and the right of people to regularise their name and
surnames in accordance with Occitan spelling.

-

The use of Aranese in education: the draft Law regulates the use of Aranese as a
habitual teaching and learning language in educational institutions located in Aran.
It also aims to enhance awareness of Aranese and its unity with the Occitan
language throughout Catalonia by including in non-university education curriculums
content associated to the linguistic situation of Aran and its connection to the
Occitan language and culture, and by establishing optional and broad-based
learning of the language in the different educational modalities. It details the
responsibilities of the Institute for Aranese Studies and the Aran General Council
with respect to establishing titles and certificates accrediting the knowledge of
Aranese.

-

Media, in the framework of the Generalitat’s powers: The draft Law regulates the
main aspects of Aranese use in the context of audiovisual communication, with a
view to ensuring the own language’s presence in the radio and television space,
and establishes measures to promote the print media and telematic information and
communication networks. It also covers undertakings derived from the European
Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, envisaging the necessary collaboration
with other bodies to accomplish same.

-

Promotion and protection measures: the draft Law recognises, defines and
delimits responsibilities shared by the Government of the Generalitat and the Aran
General Council and formulates a broad mandate to encourage the normalisation of
Aranese. Specific measures to promote the language’s use in cultural facilities and
activities are regulated, also regarding Aran’s social and economic activities, per the
undertakings set out in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
Finally, when planning collaboration with other Occitan-speaking territories it
establishes suitable mechanisms to promote and facilitate the link to the rest of the
linguistic area and exterior projection of the language.

-

Exterior projection and collaboration with the rest of the Occitan linguistic
domain: The governments of the Generalitat and Aran are given the responsibility
of promoting cultural exchanges, cooperation and communication with institutions
and entities from other Occitan-speaking territories to ensure the promotion, use
and protection of Occitan. It also envisages the possibility of encouraging, via the
Spanish State if necessary, the signing of international treaties. Regarding exterior
projection of the Occitan language, the draft Law makes it incumbent on the
Generalitat of Catalonia and the Aran General Council to disseminate Occitan
language and culture in their exterior cultural policy, and especially to ensure
dissemination, in the territories of the Occitan language domain, of the respective
language policy promoted by the Catalan and Aranese governments.

-

Economic sufficiency: A bilateral Generalitat-Aran General Council commission is
created which will annually set the framework for activities to undertake and the
necessary financing which the Generalitat will transfer to the Council.

-

Distribution of powers: The Statute of Autonomy establishes a system of powers
shared between the Generalitat of Catalonia and the Aran General Council. The
draft Law put forward by the government of the Generalitat of Catalonia emphasises
subsidiarity vis-à-vis the distribution of powers, guaranteeing that in all cases the
local government is responsible for coordinating activities to promote the Occitan
language which the Generalitat of Catalonia aims to foment in the territory of Aran.

The Framework Agreement on Language Policy Collaboration between the
Generalitat of Catalonia and the Aran General Council

Besides the consensus drafting of the above-mentioned draft Law, the Office to Promote
Occitan in Catalonia, which depends on the Language Policy Secretariat of the
Generalitat, and the Aran General Council have worked together to build a stable
framework for coordinating and financing language policies involving Aranese. A
Framework Collaboration Agreement on language policy was thus signed on 10
September 2009 by the Generalitat of Catalonia, through its vice-president and member of
government responsible for language policy, and the Síndic d’Aran, head of the local
government.

The agreement envisages the collaboration of both governments to promote the use and
knowledge of Aranese, and specifically establishes the obligation of the Generalitat of
Catalonia, via the Language Policy Secretariat, to work with the Aran General Council in
the following areas:

Organisation of courses for adults;
Coordination, revision and creation of didactic material as well as technical support
for actions and projects used to teach the language to adults;
Online training;
Literary publications, especially addressed to young people;
General and sector-specific campaigns to stimulate, promote and raise awareness;
Text translation and correction;
Actions to support the presence of Aranese in the educational environment;
To boost and disseminate use of the Occitan language in public media, especially

those depending on the Catalan administrations received in Aran, as well as in the
rest of the Occitan language domain;
To provide incentives and support literary creation;
To encourage the creation of the linguistic authority of the Occitan language.
