Greater Europe
from Iceland to Azerbaijan

So what is Greater Europe? Itʼs a vast area, stretching from Iceland
in the north-west, to Azerbaijan, in the south-east.
The Council of Europe represents this Greater European area.

47 member States

Founded on 5 May 1949 by 10
States (Belgium, Denmark, France,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway,
the Netherlands, the United Kingdom
and Sweden) and then joined by
Greece and Turkey (August 1949),
the Council of Europe now has 47
member countries, thanks to the
accession of:

Latvia, Albania, Moldova,
"the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia", Ukraine (1995),

●

Cyprus (1961),

●

Malta (1965),

●

Spain (1977),

●

San Marino (1988),

●

Switzerland (1963),

●

Portugal (1976),

●

Liechtenstein (1978),

●

the Russian Federation, Croatia (1996),
Georgia (1999),

Armenia and Azerbaijan (2001),
Bosnia & Herzegovina (2002),
Serbia (2003),

Monaco (2004),

Montenegro (2007).

Finland (1989),

Hungary (1990),

Be careful not to confuse the Council of Europe
with the European Union, a diﬀerent institution which has 27 member countries.
The Council of Europe makes its voice heard beyond the conﬁnes of the continent too.
Five other countries have observer status with the Organisation:
the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico and the Holy See.

Two oﬃcial languages

English and French are the Council of Europeʼs oﬃcial languages.
German, Italian and Russian are used as working languages.

Having a level playing ﬁeld means that two teams can
compete on an equal footing, a starting position of equality.
But beyond the sports ﬁeld, we must form one team working
together to ensure equality between men and women or
girls and boys. According to the oﬃcial texts, women and
men are equal in law but, in practice and everyday life, too
many women and girls are direct victims of exploitation,
domestic violence, unemployment, rape, discrimination
and so on.

www.coe.int/equality

Equality is not opposed to diﬀerences
In its ﬁght for gender equality, the Council of Europe reminds us that
the word ʻʻequalityʼʼ also means:

visibility: men and women must have clear access to the same jobs

and careers. Girls and boys must have the same options open to them
at school, so that they can have an equal choice of careers later on.

empowerment: a man and a woman must enjoy the same degree of

freedom. One of them must not depend on the other one. One must
not maltreat or verbally or physically abuse the other.

recognition: men and women must have equal pay for the same work.
participation: men and women must be able to participate in the
same way in political and public life, as well as in private and family
life.
Diﬀerences in gender do not mean diﬀerences in rights.

Blog it!
Ian, aged 15, publishes articles on a blog
which he shares with a few friends. He wants
to write one on freedom of expression in
Europe and manages to arrange an interview with a representative of the Council
of Europe to ﬁnd out more...
Ian: What is freedom of expression
as you see it?
Freedom of expression is part and parcel of
democracy. In the words of article 10 of the
Council of Europeʼs Convention on Human
Rights, "Everyone has the right to freedom of
expression".

Ian: Can you give me an example?
When young people get into trouble for expressing alternative and critical views on the
web about what their government is doing,
that is an infringement of their freedom of
expression.

Ian: What about the media?
The media must be independent and free to
express the full range of public opinion in
their country.

Ian: What happens if the media are all
owned by the same people?
A concentration of media in the hands of a few
is a threat to freedom of expression. When
media are monopolised by a handful of really
powerful multi-media groups, the diversity of
information sources is in danger.

Ian: Does the European Court of Human
Rights play a role in protecting freedom of
expression?

The Court plays a key role wherever freedom
of expression is challenged. Over the last thirty
years it has handed down a lot of rulings
protecting this fundamental right.

Ian: Are there any limits
to freedom of expression?
Yes, some limits have to be set, in particular to
prevent racist and xenophobic speech. Another
imperative is not undermining the presumption
of a personʼs innocence when reporting information. Media freedom is not a free licence,
either, to invade peopleʼs privacy or to make
gratuitous and unfounded defamatory statements.
Ian: Are there any circumstances where
freedom of expression is particularly under
threat?
In a democracy freedom of expression and information is vital at all times but it becomes all
the more important in a crisis, in war-time or
where there is a terrorist threat. Governments
must not take advantage of these situations,
on the pretext of guaranteeing public security,
in order to restrict the free movement of media
professionals or access to information. The
right of journalists not to reveal their sources
must also be respected.

www.facebook.com/pages/council-of-europe/42276542714
www.youtube.com/user/councilofeurope
www.coe.int/ﬁles/media-freedom/

Ian: and in the ﬁght against terrorism?
The free circulation of information and ideas is
one of the most eﬀective means of promoting
understanding and tolerance, and therefore of
preventing and combating terrorism.
Ian: Does it happen in Europe
that journalists are threatened?
In some cases journalists are harassed by
police, imprisoned for no reason and sometimes
even assassinated, simply for doing their job.
The Council of Europe condemns these incidents
whenever they occur.

Ian: What does the Council of Europe
do in the area of TV?
For over ﬁfteen years now, the Council of
Europe has been looking at the free circulation
of television programmes between the member
States, freedom to receive programmes, the
responsibility of broadcasters, programming
content and advertising. All these topics are
dealt with in the European Convention on
transfrontier television, a text which is adapted
to keep step with the latest developments.
Ian: How does the Internet inﬂuence
freedom of expression in your opinion?

The Internet has given a real boost to freedom
of expression and information. For the Council
of Europe, access to information on the Internet
must be neither controlled nor restricted, there
must be self-regulation and user anonymity
must be preserved. But some measures do have
to be taken, especially to protect children.

Cybercrime

With over a billion users in the world, the Internet has a huge impact on
society, but so too, unfortunately, does crime using the Internet, or cybercrime. The Council of Europe is the ﬁrst organisation to have drawn up a
Convention on cybercrime at international level. Cybercriminals know no
frontiers and can operate in any country.

www.coe.int/cybercrime

www.coe.int/internet-literacy/
www.wildwebwoods.org

What are the forms of cybercrime?
malware or malicious codes and programmes, which may be viruses,
worms, Trojan horses, spyware, bots or botnets
criminal enterprises using tools like botnets, which are collections of
software robots
spam, which is mass junk advertising sent to web users, not only
causing a nuisance but potentially carrying malware
child pornography and the growing sexual exploitation of children to
make money on the Internet
circulating hate pamphlets and fanatical views using websites or
spam
terrorism using the Internet (hacking attacks against key
infrastructures, recruitment, ﬁnancing, propaganda)
piracy, identity theft, fraud or money laundering to make illegal
proﬁts
white-collar crime through hacking targeting speciﬁc users,
groups, organisations or industrial companies
crime linked to the development of on-line trading, community
sites and ʻʻcloud computingʼʼ (using networked memories and
computing systems).

Proper internet use is something to be encouraged,
as long as it is completely safe.

The Council of Europe is also working to reduce the risks of
young people ending up on unsuitable sites or coming into contact
with people with the very worst intentions.

WWW is also for

Wild Web Woods, the Council of Europeʼs
on-line game which teaches young people the basic security rules
to follow when surﬁng the web.

with

Cultural diversity and biodiversity are closely connected and
should be celebrated in all our societies.
The Council of Europe sees culture as the

"soul of democracy" and develops
cultural policies aimed at:

promoting human rights

getting citizens to participate
bringing people together

reaching beyond borders thanks to common projects
asserting the diversity of cultures and identities
sharing the past

preventing conﬂicts.

The European Cultural Convention, adopted

in 1954, is the medium for European cooperation in
the areas of culture, education, youth and sport.

The intercultural cities programme

is an
initiative coordinated by the Council of Europe.
It encourages cities to use their multiculturalism to
positively manage conﬂicts and violence that might
arise as a result of the great diversity of their communities.
All manner of initiatives are encouraged: discussion
workshops on cultures, world music festivals, mediators
in hospitals, football tournaments etc

Screen-saver

Eurimages supports European ﬁlms which best reﬂect
the diversity of the continent. Over 1 200 full-length
features and documentaries have received support
from this foundation set up by the Council of Europe,
and some of them have received awards at the most
prestigious festivals.

Walking in their steps

We can trace our ancestorsʼ activities through the
archaeological footprints they left behind them.

The Council of Europeʼs Cultural routes programme
features these traces of the past in guided routes
following the paths trodden by generations of travellers over the centuries.

The Council of Europe has sketched out 25 routes

going through numerous countries, each and every

one of them a celebration of our common cultural

heritage: Routes featuring the olive tree, Vikings,
Don Quixote, Mozart and the Santiago de Compostela
Pilgrims are just a few examples.

Access your heritage

Once a year museums, historical buildings and other
cultural sites open their doors to give the citizens of
49 countries an exceptional view inside. These are
the European Heritage days, an initiative launched
by the Council of Europe in 1991.
Whether it concerns the built environment, archaeological vestiges, movable assets, landscape or
local know-how, cultural heritage forms by its very
nature a major component of our living context and
our environment. Ever since drafting the Framework
Convention on the value of cultural heritage for
society, the Council of Europe has argued the case
that heritage should leave room for human progress,
while preserving:
substantial cultural and landscape diversity

dialogue between citizens of diﬀerent cultures,
working together to make heritage part and parcel
of everyday life

sustainable enjoyment of heritage, so that future
generations can beneﬁt from it too.

Protected spaces and species

Greater Europe is also home to many forms of
wildlife and their natural habitats. Thirty years
ago, the Council of Europe introduced the Bern
Convention to ensure the conservation of natural
habitats and vulnerable wild ﬂora and fauna, from
invertebrates up to large carnivores, including
migratory species.

Biodiversity and climate change

The Council of Europe strives to soften the impact
of climate change on biological diversity, giving
opinions and guidance to States so that they take
the right kind of environmental policies on board.

Landscape format

Landscapes are meeting points between culture
and nature, evolving in time under the combined
inﬂuence of natural forces and human activity.
The Council of Europe gives pointers to its States
on how to let landscapes evolve harmoniously
while reﬂecting European diversity.

Landscapes are also:
- our day-to-day environment
- the urban or rural world
- the land or water that surrounds us

Symbols

of Greater Europe

12 gold stars

on a blue background.
The European ﬂag was adopted by the Council of Europe back in 1955.
The European Unionʼs institutions have been using the same ﬂag since
1986. The number 12 refers to perfection, the months of the year, the
apostles or the mythological works of Hercules. The stars form a circle
to symbolise unity.

The oﬃcial European anthem

is an excerpt from the prelude to
the "Ode to joy" from Beethovenʼs 9th Symphony, with an arrangement by Herbert
von Karajan, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1972 and later by the European
Union. Other arrangements have been recorded since, including for symphony
orchestra, organ, piano (classical and jazz), rock guitar, jazz violin, techno and
trance.

The Council of Europe has had its headquarters in Strasbourg
since 1949. The ʻʻEuropean districtʼʼ is also home
to other institutions, such as the EUʼs European Parliament.
